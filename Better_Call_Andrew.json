Hope you're having a great week. I am back in Los Angeles for a while. Happy to be home. New York was fabulous on Tuesday night. At the end of my trip, Puck hosted a get together at the Lowell Hotel for our luxury adjacent advertising partners. The Lowell is New York City's top five best kept secrets. It's really nice there. Hopefully it stays that way. I'm sure it will. The night's programming was a conversation between John Kelly, my boss, and Puck's founder and editor-in-chief, and me. We chatted about what's happening in luxury from tariffs to pricing to long-term strategy, and also a bit about what makes Puck so great. It was a really nice night. If you're interested in partnering with us, feel free to hit up Richie Grinn, Richie Grinn, Richie at Puck.News for more info. Also, if you want to check out the conversation, there are many clips of it on Puck's Instagram, so go with God and joy. This week in Line Sheet, there's a lot going on. Can find all my Met Gala, some Prelatives. People enjoyed that. Some beauty scoops from Rachel Sragat involving makeup by Mario and Drunk Elephant, two of the biggest beauty brands in the world. Plus, I have a really scoopy fun story on Satisfy Running and its recent fundraise. This is a Paris-based, fashion-y, running, active wear brand that I have been really interested in since it launched. They raised money from 1686 partners, the Luxembourg-based private equity firm, rumbi, David Wertheimer, son of Gerard Wertheimer. You may know the name because the Wertheimers own Chanel. There's also fun, interesting info in there. Satisfy of itself is a good story, but about what's happening in the sports world and with Nike and all that, but I'm even more interested in David, who seems to want to live a more public life than his extremely private father and uncle. So let's do an interview, David. Call me. Sarah Shapiro is also back from the Altaur Mall Capital of the World, Los Angeles, where she attended a Beyonce show and did a lot of shopping. So check out her insights in Friday's email. Let's get going with Andrew. Andrew Rosen, welcome to Fashion People. Good to be here. Thank you for taking the time. So on Friday mornings, the first question we ask is, what did you have for breakfast? I had my normal breakfast, scrambled egg whites and a toasted scooped-out bagel. Sounds pretty good. No cream cheese. Well, I had a little cream cheese. You got to have a little cream cheese, right? I'll always have to spread the cream cheese. Did you start scooping out your bagel in the 90s when Sex and the City was on? I don't know. I started scooping out the bagel when I decided that it was a bit healthier for me. What's your feeling about like Osempic and all that stuff? You know, I think that, I think it's good. I think it's good. I think that, you know, it's, and Osempic, I understand, has lots of other benefits other than just losing weight. Yeah. I get fed a lot because I write about, I don't know if you've noticed, but I like to check in on what's happening with the GLP ones. And I get fed a lot of information about them on Instagram. And I just read this week that there's new evidence that it can repair liver damage. Yeah. So it's all good. Yeah. It's all good. It does mean that you don't want to drink every person this week in New York, every event I've been to, no one's drinking. Yeah. It stops like your interest in alcohol apparently. Oh, not only eating but drinking. Yeah. You have no, no interest in anything fun apparently. So Andrew, I've known you for probably what, I mean, I've known of you and written about your companies for longer than I've known you, but I've known you for about 10 years. Maybe longer. Maybe longer at this point and have covered all of your businesses pretty much the ones that I know about. I know there are many I probably don't. But can you maybe let's start and can talk a bit about who you are and why you're on this podcast. Like what is your role in the fashion industry? I mean, you have to, I guess you have to understand, I started back in 1977 working for my dad. My dad was a famous clothing manufacturer back in a whole nother era. But instead of going to college, I ended up going to work for my dad and really started working in the factories, warehouses and learning the business sort of from the inside out. And you know, I've had, my father was the first licensee for Calvin Klein and Calvin Klein jeans. And so that's where I started. And I really started out at the beginning of a whole new generation or a whole new generation in our industry of designer identified product. Really if you look back before, you know, I guess the start of American design with Calvin Klein, Halston, Perry Ellis and Klein. Before that there were just big companies that had branded product and designer identified product really started in the mid 70s. So I started at a whole new generation of the business. And I think I just grew up with that. And I grew up with working with designers and making really fashionable product, exciting product. And you know, from Calvin Klein went to Anclin and then I started theory. And at theory, I think that maybe that was the start of the contemporary marketplace. And you know, I sort of was one of the first people to identify that there was a void in the market. And we needed clothes that were a little more contemporary than what was going on in the bridge market that were a little cooler, were a little faster, were a little more fashionable. And so I really have sort of been at the forefront of many things that have happened in our industry over the last almost 50 years. You started theory and we're talking it was mid 90s, right? 1997. 1997. So it's in the middle of sort of helmet laying, Joe Sander, Prada, all these brands like true fashion brands and consumers in the US also buying them, which it wasn't that's when like buying fashion really, I feel like became a thing that people with money did in America. What did you learn from the experience working with your dad with Calvin Klein and then Anclin that made you want to start theory, which was kind of giving that same look of those Italian or European brands at a more reasonable price and to a bigger audience and sort of explaining to them why quality mattered, all of that stuff. You did, I think of you a lot as like a explanatory person in the industry that you educate a lot of consumers on how to dress and why clothes matter, that sort of thing. Yeah. I mean, I think you have to understand to me, American fashion and European fashion are different, right? And I think they're different for a very simple reason. The artisans and the designers in Europe work very, very closely together. And I talk about artisans, I talk about the fabric mills, I talk about the factories. And I think that there's a very different sensibility about design in Europe. And America is more about pop culture. And America is more about, if you just look at what American companies are much more democratic, they're not so hung up on every detail of fashion. They're not so hung up on the emotion of fashion. I think there's more about the business of fashion. And I think theory in a lot of ways was more about the business of fashion. It was really making clothes that worked for the modern woman. It didn't matter whether she was in America or she was in Europe or she was in Asia, theory just worked. And it had a designer sensibility. It had fabrics from the best mills in Europe. And it had incredible quality, but it was simple in its design and thereby worked for lots of women. And the fit and the quality and the integrity of the clothing was what was most important to me. And I think that's something that I learned from my early days working with my dad and working with Calvin. It's also such a great name. It wasn't when I started it was funny, everyone. When I started it wasn't a great name, but I think the business made it into a great name for sure. Well, you shape the business and so people followed in your stead. But interestingly, you sold it pretty... When did you sell to fast retailing in 04 or did you...? No, I sold to fast retailing in 2003. But I did that for lots of reasons. Hey, I had a partner. And I thought it was time that my partner and I went our separate ways. Also felt like we started the company with very little, with nothing. And we ended up with a $150 million business that was worth a lot of money. And I was still young and I felt like maybe I could do a lot more with the money than I could do with the business. And my intention was really to sell the business and go do something else. But it turned out that I ended up staying as the CEO for fast retailing for another 15 or 16 years. And I think that was a great testament to fast retailing and Misty and I and the inspiration and leadership that he provided and also the fact that he knew how to work with me. I think he knew the things that I needed to keep me happy and thereby he got the benefit of me as the founder of the company staying on 16 years after I sold it to help make sure that it got firmly established as a brand hopefully for many years to come. When you sold in 2003 to fast retailing to Dashi and I, the chairman and I assume founder of that company that owns Uniclo and Theory and all this other stuff, was it surprising that you sold to a Japanese company? It wasn't because my closest friend at the time, Ricky Sasaki, who was a wonderful, wonderful man and a really, really terrific guy has since passed away, he started Theory in Japan. And Theory in Japan basically grew up with Theory in America. I wanted to do that one because I wanted to help my friend, but two because I wanted to have an international company. I didn't want to have just an American company. And Ricky and I were very close. He knew everything I was doing in America. He thought a lot like me and understood me. So we built this company in Japan at the same time we were building Theory in America. It was Ricky that introduced me to Missi and I. And you have to understand Missi and I is just one of the foremost intuitive and special people there is in the world. He saw the value in owning a company like Theory. And I don't think he expected me. I don't think he expected me to be there any more than a year. I don't think he expected that he would need me any more than a year. But it turned out that we had a wonderful relationship for a long time. And I think he inspired me in many ways and taught me a lot about global business, about just how to be a global executive. And I think one of the great things in my career is starting with my father. But even after my father, I've had the opportunity to work with, be associated with some incredible men and women that have really inspired me and taught me how to be a lot more than maybe I could have been on my own. And Missi and I was certainly one of those people. I also wonder if I assume that Theory being based in the U.S. and having a robust Japanese business, but being based in the U.S., Uniclo has over the years, is now very successful in the U.S. And it was a lot of stops and starts. But I'm sure that having this business that was so big in the U.S. made them understand the market more, even though Theory sits at a different price. Oh, I think that Missi and I totally appreciated the fact that Theory was a foundation, foundational business in the U.S. and gave him a home to be able to build from. And being associated with American company and to have American executives like myself and some of the other members of the team, I think that was part of his motivation and it was very smart, I think, in the fact that he did it that way.

HelloALMA.com So in 2019, after 15 years of working, being the CEO of Theory but working for Mr. Unigh, you finally, quote unquote, retired, which is the is, I don't know if it's an oxymoron, but it's definitely funny given how much you work. Obviously, six months later, COVID happened, but what have you been doing since you left fast retailing? Because I assume you could have just been golfing and doing your horse stuff, but you obviously are doing more than that. I play a fair amount of golf and I fish, which I like to do a lot. And I have fair bird resources, but I grew up in the fashion business. I really love fashion. And I feel like I'm still relevant in the industry. And so I have stayed with it. And I do a lot of things. I had invested in lots of companies during the time I was at Theory and have continued to invest in companies. And there's probably too many of them to mention here. But I'm definitely inspired by working with entrepreneurs. I'm definitely inspired by working with people that can teach me things, people that I can get inspired by and hopefully sometimes inspire. And I like building businesses. I was lucky enough to get involved with the rag and bone guys early on. I got involved with Stacey at Alice and Olivia very early on. I got involved with Veronica Beards early on. All of those businesses were very small when I got involved. And now they're cornerstones of business, not only in America, but throughout the world. And the other person that was really important to me and has been important to me over the last number of years was Jens Greed at Initially Frame and Good American and Skims and many other things. And Jens and I met 10 or 12 years ago. And really we're friends from the first time we met. And I've done a lot of stuff together and continued to do a lot of things together. So I tend to be able to find people that inspire me and I think this one thing that's true with all of them, they're incredibly talented and they have a lot of integrity. And I like working with people like that. What made you want to start investing in fashion? You know how hard it is. You're particularly good at making money in fashion, which I don't know many people who are. But you know how challenging of a business it is. What made you like with Stacey or the rag and bone guys early on or the Veronica's? What made you decide, okay, I'm going to put a good amount of my money into these businesses and help guide them? I mean, you have to understand something. I spent my whole life in this business. My father before me spent his whole life in the business. And his father spent his whole life in the business. So I like to say like, you know, there's 125 years of experience here. But I just think it's just something I don't even, the crazy thing is I don't look at a financial report or a balance sheet or anything when I'm investing in these businesses. I just look at the product and talk to the people. And you know, from there I can see what the opportunity is. I don't really like to do startups. I mean, there's only, there's really only two companies that I've started from scratch. One is theory and the next one is something we're going to talk about, I'm sure, a little bit later, is TWP. But other than that, I really have liked investing in people and helping people grow their business. But I like to see companies that have been able to establish themselves in making a product, designing a product, making a product and selling a product. And I like to, you know, make sure that the people I'm investing with can go from A to B to C, right? And if they can go from A to B to C, I can really help them. In any of these companies, I don't do much work, but I do do a lot, have a lot of conversation with them and talk to them about ideas or just help them achieve the vision that they have. And, you know, I like collaborating with people and working together. It doesn't always have to be my idea. If you look at the companies I'm invested in, aesthetically, they're all very different. And aesthetically, some of them are not even my aesthetic, but I totally understand and can plug into someone else's vision and someone else's aesthetic and help them achieve their goals. When you're looking at these companies, is it the founder's grit? Is it product market fit or whatever? Like, knowing that there's a custom, seeing a customer for whatever it is, it's, to me, it feels like the people you tend to invest in are people who are willing to go the extra mile and work really hard and don't think that they are just going to get something handed to them. But how much of that is what drives you when you give someone a check versus, I think that this is a product that people in the market need right now? I mean, I think most of the time, I like to work with people that I feel have something a little extra, right? For example, I mean, I just have invested in Danielle Frankel, the bridal business, and I think her, she's incredibly talented and creative. She has a husband who's her partner in the business who's really, really strong and supports her. And I think they had spent a number of years building their business, and all they needed, in my opinion, was some capital and some advice and support. And I think they can double and triple and quadruple their business over a very short period of time. But they really had the design integrity and the personal integrity that is important to me. Yeah, I thought that was a really interesting one. And I'm going to have her on because I want to learn more about her model and how they're developing because it is is unique in the bridal space to see something that doesn't feel like it's the way it's been done before. Right. And I think that space, that space is open for somebody with new ideas and a fresh perspective. And I think she'll, I think there's a huge opportunity there. Yeah, I agree. I feel like it's not a replenishment business, but it's definitely, there's always a customer, there's always someone getting married, and there needs to be new ways to service that person. How much do you think about price point? Because Danielle Frankel, her dresses are, a lot of them are really, really expensive. Yeah, so that's different from a lot of your price point has been in that what was long called the contemporary space, which you actually, you essentially created with maybe there was two other people, I don't know who coined the term, but you created it. Theory was, you know, ground floor of that. And right now in particular pricing has become such a hot topic because luxury goods have gotten so expensive. And at the same time, fast fashion made everything cheaper now with the tariffs, who knows what's going to happen. But how important to you is the price and how do you determine that they've kind of landed on the right pricing? I mean, this is going to sound terrible, but I don't really think about price at all. That's interesting. Tell me. Price is not really a relevant conversation to me. For me, I think that, listen, first of all, I don't want to make clothes that are too cheap, and I don't want to make clothes that are too expensive. And the reason is, I don't feel that I could be competitive in either marketplace. I think American companies and Americans are a big disadvantage, as I said earlier in the designer space. I think that we are at a big disadvantage. I think in the more mass space, there's always someone cheaper. And I don't think in a cheap way. I'm not a no-frills operator. I believe in quality. I believe in integrity. I believe in making emotional clothes. But when it comes to price, I think that, yes, you have to offer value, but there's the prices related to what the things cost you. And if the product costs X, we have to get X plus plus. And that's the way. I don't really feel price is a deterring factor within the shade band of the marketplace that I work in. So within the marketplace that I work in, I don't really think about price. At Ragnpone or Alice Olivia or Frame or TWP, I mean, the price is the price. And if it's $20 more or $20 less, I don't think it matters to the customer. I think what matters is, how does it fit? How does it feel? How does it look? And as long as we're delivering that, I feel that we're going to succeed. And we work at a certain margin. We work at extraordinary margins, but we don't work. And so price is what it has to be. It's not really a factor for me. I feel like a lot of people would say that TWP, for instance, which was started a few years ago by Trish West Coast Pound. And you have your partner in it. She worked with you at Theory. And you've made this into a very significant business pretty quickly. I think one of the reasons it's been so successful is the quality is really, really good for the price. I think a lot of people would say, I can't make stuff at the price Andrew makes it at because I don't have the relationships. How much of the margin that you do get is because you've been doing this for so long and you know exactly how to do it. So you have to understand, I started when I went to work for my father. My father maybe spent the first two and a half years in the factories in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and Long Island, and El Paso, Texas, understanding how to make clothes and working with on the sewing floor, working with pattern makers, working with the cutters. So I understand the business in sort of a unique way. And you know, it's just, it's sort of second nature to me as to how to design clothes, manufacture clothes, and sell clothes. And I think that that's now you add the component of marketing, which didn't exist back in the day, back in the day there, because the magazines and departments did all the marketing for you now today. It's different. But I mean, it's fairly simple. It's just a question of understanding it. Do you think most people don't understand it or do they not try to? Or because I do think a lot of people have issues because they over develop or they don't find the right factory for the right item and they just make a lot of mistakes that end up being costly and it feels like you... I make a lot of mistakes too, by the way. I don't think I don't make mistakes. I'm sure, but the net net is positive. Works good. But I don't know. I just think that all of our companies are really focused on what our mission is and where we sit in the marketplace. And we tend to think forward and not think backwards. I think that we're all entrepreneurs. I like entrepreneurs and my partners are all entrepreneurs and we're interested in what's coming tomorrow, not what came yesterday. And I think that's a big part of the success of our companies. And I think that maybe I was lucky because that's who I found all the time. But yeah, it's like that. Well, I think you have one of the skills that you really have is eye for knowing talent on the design side and the business side. And I know a lot of people who have wanted money from you and you haven't given it to them. And I know why. Because I know the way you think and I know the way they think. And you do make a lot of sound choices like your partnership with Yens, who has also been on this podcast and everyone should listen to that episode. But every time I've talked to him, he brings you up. And I think that that mentorship and that back and forth, you also do have a really good sense of who is willing to go the distance, essentially, I think. Yeah, I mean, I think that partnership and mentorship and collaboration is critically important. And I think that I've over the years have learned who I can work with and who I can't work with. And clearly, there's a lot of companies that maybe I wanted to invest in, but I didn't invest in because I just didn't think that it would work. I give you the best story. I had an opportunity to invest in WeWork. When WeWork was just starting and his first WeWork was right across the street from me in my theory office. And he used to come up and see me, Adam, used to come up and see me almost every day. And we would talk about things. It was incredibly exciting. It was incredibly, he was really a very visionary guy. And he wanted me to invest in WeWork. Stupid me says, I don't trust this guy. Well, in the end, I mean, you probably would have still made a lot of money, but in the end, you were right. In the end, I was right, but I was really wrong. So, you know. I have stories like that about, like I ignored the Warby Parker people for five years before I talked to them. Mine have no financial implications, but everybody misses out on some stuff. But anyway, I'm just saying, I don't, it's got to take a lot of boxes for me to to invest because, you know, I mean, listen, Stacy and I have been partners for over 20 years. The Veronica's and I, you know, Jens and I, it's a long term, this is a long term thing. It's not, it's not, you know, it's not a couple of years. I'm not a private equity investor. You know, it's different than that. You know, the private equity, they have a five year horizon.

With Trish and TWP, that is something you mentioned that it's really the only other company other than Theory You Started. Why did you want to go into business with her? And also, what has that been like building something over the last five years in the middle of COVID and all this other stuff? And also, it's a totally different market from when you started Theory. I mean, Trish, someone introduced me to Trish. Someone said, have you seen what Trish is doing? I said, no. I said, why don't you have her call me? She called me. And remember, Trish and I worked together for six years very closely. She was actually the president of Theory at one time. And she wasn't a designer. And one season, my designer quit. And I said, Trish, you're going to go and design the line. She said, what do you mean? I said, well, I need somebody to design it. You're going to do it. You can do this. You have great style. You have great taste. You're an incredible merchant. And you go do it. And anyway, that's how she started designing. But anyway, in 2023, 2022, someone said to me, have you seen what Trish is doing? I had met with Trish and she started to pull out all these clothes from this bag that she was carrying. And I said, Trish, okay, enough stuff. I said, I got it. And I guess that it struck a chord with me that I had been investing and helping all these people in their business. And I sort of wanted to do something that was a little bit more personal to me. And where I could start and create a culture and an environment that was more in line with what I liked. And Trish's aesthetic and what Trish does is very aligned with what I like and what I do. And Trish and I work super well together and very seamlessly and effortlessly. So yeah, I wanted to start something again that reflected a lot of my views on how companies should run. And Trish, she's an incredible designer, merchant, incredible talent. I think one of the most talented, one of the most talented undiscovered in America, by the way. She's super good and designs everything herself. But she knows that she loves to design clothes and to do all of that. And I'm able to do the business side of it and all of that. And it works really nicely. It works really, really well. So you primarily work in this, as we were saying, contemporary space. And also, in theory, I don't know when you left with the percentage. I know a lot of it was direct to consumer by the time you exited. But you made a lot of money at department stores and multi-brand retailers. And TWP is in a lot of stores. I did a story with you guys, probably what, two years ago now or a year and a half ago. And I talked to Beth from Kiernan Zabat. It's still, it's a really important, I remember talking to Elise Walker about it. It had become a really important account very quickly. How has, and obviously I write a lot about sort of changing face of multi-brand retail and what's going to happen with Eukstead, a Porter group and SACs and all these things in the last 10 years, and especially in the last five since you left theory, how has the relationship with brands and stores changed? And how has the retail client, like what's your, I mean, this is 50 questions in one, but what's your big picture observation of multi-brand retail and what role it plays in the fashion ecosystem at this point? I think multi-brand retail is a necessity. I think it's critical. And I think the eyes, the eye of someone like a Jeffrey or Beth at Kern is a better, Elise Walker, on and on and on is critically important. And if you look around the country, every may, not even major city, every city has their local fashion retailer that's got a perspective and a point of view and an eye from coast to coast, by the way. And I think it's critically important that that exists. And I think those specialty stores have a loyal following. What happened, in my opinion, is the department stores have lost their way. And the department stores became a sea of merchandise and not a point of view and not an experience for the customer to shop in. And that's the thing that has to change back again. And I think that there is, the thing that happened is that brands were forced to go direct to consumer, their own stores, their own websites. So the need for third-party retail is very, very different. And the amount of third-party retail that is required in the future is very, very different than it was 10 years ago. And you saw, I mean, Barney's closed, nobody missed them. I know. Nobody missed them. I mean, it's almost sad, but nobody missed them. Everybody misses it, but nobody misses it. Everyone thinks they miss it, but would they be shopping there? Exactly. Although I hear this, what Prentom has done, I haven't seen it, but I hear it's pretty epic what they're doing downtown. It's fabulous and it's really good for food and beverage. I think you would go in there and be like, here are the five things you need to change with the merchandising. It's not merchandised in a way that makes it easy to shop. Well, it's an exciting experience and I think it's gotten a lot of traffic. I mean, the location is maybe a little difficult. So I think that the future is going to be, I think that, and the other thing, the thing that happened with all these websites is that, again, it just, there was too many of them and they were competing with all the brands too. So everything needed to be right sized again. And I was actually a big proponent and a big fan of the Saxon Neiman's merger because I think that there's a major opportunity there for them to really reestablish luxury retailing in America and make sense of it because I believe though that it has to be more edited and curated both from an assortment point of view and a store point of view. I think that they have to invest heavily in their stores and I think that Richard and his team are very, very smart guys and I think that if they have the resources to be able to do it, it's going to be a big success. And it's important that it is successful. But I think that the department stores are a part of the mix. I think specialty stores are a bigger part of the mix. I think what this, what Bob Mitchell is doing with Mitchell's is really exciting. And I think that's an important player in the landscape here. And I think we need those kind of, we need those kind of entrepreneurial merchants, operators to really create exciting retail experiences and the customer wants to shop and the customer wants to shop in physical retail. I think they do a lot of looking online but they do a lot of buying in physical retail today. That's interesting because I always feel like it's the opposite where when people even go in, they look and then they go online and buy. But you would have the data to know. I think it's the reverse. I think that, to me, what I see happening is physical retail is growing at a much faster rates than digital retail. I think that people are wanting, they want to be able to actually see the close in three dimension. Remember, shopping online is two dimensional and it has its limitations. And I think that people now are really doing a lot of shopping online but buying in stores. And I think that that's changed. But I think that they also want a nice experience in physical retail. And I think that's what is starting to happen. And I think that the experience is getting a lot better. I think the malls are getting a lot better. I think the malls are getting a lot more exciting. And I think that's as they start to transform into more lifestyle centers and not just clothing warehouses. Would you ever open a store yourself, a multi-brand? Or I feel like, I mean, I promise no surprises. But I vaguely remember you being part of a group of people who at one point tried to buy Barney's. But maybe I'm wrong. Sam Ben Avram, who's a good friend of mine, had wanted to do it. And I certainly was willing to support him and like the concept of it. But no. I mean, I think that there's a special skill in being a third-party retailer. And I think that I would leave that to the retailers. But I have become, obviously, as a brand now, there's a greater... And most of the companies that I'm involved in, we would be 60-65% direct to consumer. And I think that therein, it's just a it's a much easier experience for us to be doing direct business than wholesale business. Although the wholesale business is an important part of what we do. And it's something that I think is necessary. I think the having the authenticity of a major retailer, whether it's Fax or Neiman's or Mitchell's or Kernes' Bed or Elise Walker or Netaporte, say that your product is good enough for us to carry it is an important thing. I'm sure you talk to young designers all the time. You talk to newer brands all the time. I'm sure people are constantly asking you for advice. In the middle of all this, I'm not even going to touch tariffs because every brand is so different. Every company operates so differently. You produce a lot of stuff in the U.S. But I'm sure a lot of your stuff is sourced in China or near China or connected to China or whatever. What broad advice could you give someone right now who is thinking, why am I doing this? It's impossible. I have so many friends who had brands at matches lost $500,000 and now they're like, oh, what am I going to do now with all this tariff stuff? I'm going to be out another three under grand or a million or whatever. How do you keep going? I think there are a lot of headwinds for sure. The tariffs are certainly front and center of that. The other thing that's a problem for small companies is who's going to champion them? The big retailers today are only interested in big brands. I think that's a mistake. The new up-and-coming brands are the exciting ones, the important ones. Customers like to discover new brands. Customers likes the next generation of what a jacket looks like or what a pair of pants looks like or what a sweater looks like. That comes from young designers starting their business. Unfortunately, there isn't the retailers like Barneys. Barneys was good at it, of championing these young companies and helping them get off the ground. I think it's more difficult today. I definitely believe that that's why I like so much the local specialty stores. When I started TWP, the whole focus was specialty stores and not department stores. We were able to sell 175 specialty stores around the country and build a big following and a big business. Then we were able to start our e-commerce site and open stores and everything else. I think that it couldn't have been done if I just wanted to sell department stores. Yeah. I think the real trick for young brands today is really the whole specialty store route. There is a lot of them and there are some exciting ones and they're pretty healthy. I think the problem with department stores is they don't want a brand that does $500,000 or $1,000,000 worth of business. It doesn't do them any good. It doesn't move the needle. I think it's something that the department stores have to rethink though because I think they have to set up an area of their store that's incubating the next generation of whether it's a Veronica beard or whether it's Nilly Loh-Tan or whether it's whoever and TWP and all. They have to make it easy for a point of entry for those brands to get started. Right now, it's not that easy. It takes someone with experience and somebody that knows how to cut through the red tape to be able to build a business. I have talked to a lot of young brands, many of who I actually would, at some point, would like to invest in and help who I think have really good clothes. They make it in America or they make it overseas. Connecting all the dots between the design, the merchandising, the marketing, the manufacturing and the commerce is very hard for them. Andrew, I have to run. We've already been talking for almost an hour. Can you believe it? My last question for you is, what do you think is next? What do you think, looking ahead, the companies you're talking to, the things you're invested in, what do you think the next phase of the industry looks like? The industry at the moment has lots of challenges. The industry at the moment also, I'm an opportunistic person, so I think there's a lot of opportunities too. The whole tariff thing where that's going to end up, sacks and demons where that's going to end up, how that's going to end up, I have a lot of confidence in what they're going to do and what they can be doing. It certainly has been challenging for us with some of the things they have been doing. I think that America, the industry, people are very creative and they will come up with the next generation of the fashion industry, whatever it be. I think that physical retail is definitely back and physical retail is an important component in the future. I believe that we just have to keep working at it and see what's next. Andrew, thank you so much. I also just want to personally thank you because you've taught me a lot about the industry over the years, just by in the way you work and answering questions for me. You've been a mentor to a lot of people, but also to me. That's very nice of you to say. I have a lot of respect for you and what you do. From the first time I met you, I felt that there was something unique about your style of reporting and so on. I know you've been on the forefront of way too many stories here, but you usually get it right. Too many stories. You usually get it right. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate it. I endeavor to get it right, but let's do part two soon. This was awesome. Talk to you. Thank you, Andrew. Fashion People is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck.
