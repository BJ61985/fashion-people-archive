Twice a week, I'm going to be coming at you with fashion news and chatter that people are talking about behind the press releases. Today I have with me none other than Jacob Gallagher, the fashion columnist at the Wall Street Journal. He mostly covers menswear, but he knows a lot about women's too. Up first, we're going to be talking about the luxury slowdown affecting LVMH caring and the like. Those new balance loafers that everybody was talking about last week and the fashion in the film challengers, which was costume designed by none other than Loewe designer Jonathan Anderson. Plus, every Tuesday we'll unpack one big rumor going around the group chats. First up, is John Galliano really going back to Givenchy? Would LVMH really take him back? We're going to talk about it. Let's get started. Jacob, welcome to Fashion People. Happy to be here. I'm very excited to be here. Do you feel the pressure? I've gotten so many messages in the last week like, I can't wait for this to start. I do feel the pressure. I was surprised how quickly people texted me and were like, did you already record the episode? What did you talk about when it's coming out? People that I definitely would not have expected to have been a within five seconds reader of your newsletter. I am very happy to be here. How was your weekend? It was very nice actually. I went and saw a lot of art, which was wonderful. Went to the Met. I was going to say, did you go to a gallery? You went to the Met. Which exhibit did you see? I went to the Met. I saw the Harlem Renaissance show, which was wonderful. Then there's a very good Philip Gustin show at the Met as well right now. Did you buy anything? I bought, well, I didn't buy anything in person. But I had, I collect these very specific, stucy shirts that are this kind of Oliver print that they did back in the day. I had one arrived this weekend, which was a very good one, actually a very, very old one from 1985. More stucy. More stucy. That's all I really buy. I bought some stuff. You're always shopping. I feel like you are the consummate shopper in a way. I'm not really. I buy one thing every couple of weeks or one thing every couple of months. I went to, there's a really big thing happening in women's retail right now where a lot of brands are doing. It's not trunk shows where you're like pre-ordering. They're not really doing anything else. They're just shopping events. Especially here in LA, I don't get invited to that many of them, but I went to an Addersea one, which is the direct to consumer brand. They kind of do them so they can have in real life experiences. I got a cardigan and a blouse. But then the woman I was going to lunch with right afterwards, who was an agent at CAA, we went to lunch and she was like, I'm going to the swam to Kate on Friday and then Maria McManus next week. And I think that's the basically the only way people are getting people to shop right now, which is that like sort of one to one experience. So today we have a lot on the agenda. I know you're very excited. The first thing I wanted to talk about today was what's going on in the broader luxury market with sales and kind of what we're talking about with like, how do you get people to shop when they want to go on vacation, when they're not just sitting at home, when they don't have stimulus checks coming through. And last week, LVMH had its quarterly earnings and they missed analyst estimates, which never happens. It just never happens. And you know, the market was still pretty kind to them and the analyst reports were sort of like, it's okay. It's okay to, they missed. I'm just going to kind of go through how it did. So like they missed analyst estimates. Louis Vuitton was up. Dior, you know, they don't exactly say, but the analyst, this was the, what they pulled from it. Dior did not reach the level of the rest of the fashion group. So Dior, not great. Sephora basically carried the whole thing. They're doing super well. Tiffany and this week, Cari Hermes, a bunch of others have their earnings and Cari already issued this profit warning that China was going to be really bad. Generally, there's not enough Sabato de Sarno's product in the stores yet. That's what they're saying. And so it's not going to be good today when, when Cari's earnings come out. So I'm curious from you. So we have the macro issues, China, China, the consumer is not shopping. The consumer is not shopping as much as they think they should be the US consumers shopping, but like in this very specific way, from your perspective, you talk to a lot of consumers for, for the stories you write. You also look at the market. You look at the sales. What do you think is going on and how do you think they could fix it? Yeah, I'm not nearly as like in the week. Like I, I obviously, I've read the certainings report and it did strike me, you know, things still seemed positive overall to me. I think that carrying it's going to be much harder for them, frankly, through this period. But I think right now what we're seeing is effectively that I feel like we're in this pattern where we're waiting for the shoe to drop. We're waiting for the next thing that's going to really get people motivated to shop, get them excited to shop, get people out there. And I think that that's what they're having. These luxury groups are having this problem where their propositions are not landing in the market like they used to. We've talked, I feel like he's becoming a bit of the punching bag in the fashion circles, but Sabato DiSardo Gucci is spinning at how they're spinning it. Carrying is spinning at how they're spinning it, but that doesn't seem to be getting consumers as excited as analysts had hoped. I think a lot of analysts had pretty negative things to say after the second show, but I think that that's true overall, that when you look at the market, like, you know, Ferella Louis Vuitton on the men's side is taking up a ton of oxygen. It's incredibly hard to cut through and say, you know, this is what you should get behind. I'm wondering if maybe for LVMH it's going to be like the Olympics and the number of eyeballs that are going to be on them in their portfolio throughout the Olympics. If that will move the needle in some capacity, it's really, really hard to say right now what people want and what is going to make people spend money. Yeah. I don't think it's going to help with sales at all. The Olympics, I think what it's going to do is make LVMH as big of a brand as McDonald's or Nike, which is what they really need at this point so that people do go and buy wallets at Louis Vuitton, which is what they can, most people can afford. So, but I think you're right. It's so interesting. The Sabato thing, I'm going to the show, the resort show in May because I want to see it. Here is the thing. It did not land the way they wanted it to land or the way that people thought it would land for many reasons. And in China, which is really interesting, I was talking to a Chinese born luxury CEO who was saying, you know, the thing about Chinese consumers is they're very quick to pick up a trend, but they hold onto it longer than most people. So if they like something, they jump on it, but then they hold onto it for a long time. So if, if you don't propose something like you're saying the proposition, if you don't propose something that they can jump on to quickly, there is a lag. And I think right now the interesting thing about what Sabato is doing is I have to say all I want to wear right now is like, is a sort of short dress, like a short mod dress. And that he is the only one making. I'm not going to buy one. I bought one from St. John and I'm going to get it like tailored to him two inches so it's not crazy short. I mean, he's making really short dresses that I am too old to wear or just whatever. But, but the point being that I actually think he is sort of getting and the accessories are really good, but it might take a year and a half and it might never happen. And so it is like a weird time. And I agree. I feel like there needs to be something and we all thought it would be this Phoebe Fila thing that would sort of shift everything and maybe it will be, but nothing is like happening so fast the way it did with Alessandro Michele or, or Demna or Ed Balenciaga or whatever. Or Virgil. I mean, I think that we went through this period where we had huge figureheads that were like from the mountaintop saying, this is what you should wear. This is where things are moving. And I think for one thing, certainly we can look at how caring spun Michele leaving with Gucci, they wanted that brand to be so much bigger. And the mentality was to be that big, you kind of have to be a little less specific. That was at least how I was interpreting it. And what we lost in that, I think was this notion of, you know, a true creative dictate. And I think people are playing it really safe right now with how the market is, but I don't think that's moving product. No, well, we'll see. So you know who is not playing it safe is New Balance, who launched last week. I guess you'll have to explain a bit of this. It sounds like it was first introduced at a junior show, the men's show last, last year, but New Balance launched a loafer sneaker and you tweeted something to the effect of like RIP Steve Jobs, you would have loved the New Balance loafer sneaker, which is not true. But can you please explain to me what this loafer sneaker is? There's no way, but we can talk about it in a minute. First, let's explain what this sneaker is and where it was introduced and why you are interested in it as a menswear follower. So this is actually, this is great timing for me. I will have an article out today on this. I just spoke with the designer like an hour or so ago. Who's the designer, Teddy Santis? Her name is, her name is Charlotte Lee. She is based in outside Manchester. She's the senior footwear designer at New Balance. And this truly is, she's also responsible for the New Balance 327, which I don't think a lot of people will know off the top of their head, but if you Google it, you'll see it and you'll be like, Oh yeah, that's you. I've seen that shoe everywhere. It's not actually the most literal sneaker dress shoe I've seen. That still stands as I think the Cole Han, what is it? The Lunar Grand, I believe is what it is. Yeah, the Cole Han Lunar Grand from like the aughts, which we still see like banker bros wear all the time. But what New Balance did is they took a running shoe that they had, they took the laces, took the eyelets off, made the upper a loafer and it works on pretty much every level that a shoe needs to work right now. It is riffing off of a huge trend. It's riffing off of, you know, whether you see it through dad sneakers or the like Y2K mesh heavy runner thing, really riffing off that. Totally a comfort minded shoe. Slip it on, you know, everything is a slip on these days. All these footwear giants are already making everything a mule inexplicably to me. And then finally, it's totally memeable, which is what every single shoe that hits these days has to be memed. You know, say what you will about mischief, but what they wrought with the big red boot, we just live in the after effects of that forever now, I think. The shoe is not even out until they'd set August. I need a fact check that, but they said it's not even coming out till August, but it's everywhere. Everyone can see it already. Okay. So one thing, it was first introduced at this Junior Wanton Avi show in January, and it was in green, right? It didn't hit there, I think because it was, they were solid colored and like people saw it and were like, okay, fine. And also you expect that from Junya. The general release one that's like the silver and white in the mesh paneling, that's the one that's going to hit and be all over fricking dime square. And we're just going to live with that everywhere. Yeah. Okay. So last week, when you tweeted about it, I was really disgusted. What I will say the three, two, seven, no offense to Charlotte. I hate that sneaker. I think it's really bad. I don't like it. It's like very basic beat. But that's how new balance position that shoe though. In a way, it's like a shoe. Yeah. That's not all in the design. Sure. Sure. And someday it will be also be seen as like cool because it's so cheesy or whatever. This sneaker now looking a week later and the context of the junior show. I'm a little more into it, but what I will say to you is Steve Jobs would have never worn that sneaker. I have a Steve Jobs expert in my home. This is a man who wore 501s is he Miyake, the same exact turtleneck every single day. And he wore what number is it that he wore? Either the 996 or the 990 some sneaker hat is going to come from me that I'm wrong about that. But that is, I believe it was one of the 996. I think it's the 990. But let me just say, first of all, he had really classic good taste. He would not have even known these existed. There is no way he would have ever worn them, Jacob. And you know that. I'm sure you've, have you, how many Apple Keynotes have you watched? Because I've watched probably, I've watched at least 10 of him on them and probably had to watch them 50 times. Like it is, it is, my husband, it literally was like, should we show Fritz the iPhone Apple Keynote now? Because he's starting to watch screens. So I'm just telling you that that man would not have worn those sneakers. Why, why did you say that? In my defense, so my favorite era of Steve Jobs style, disgusting sentence right there. But is the double breasted suit when he, with the bow tie before he made the very intentional pivot to I'm going to be Mr. Futuristic because he was, in my opinion, more genuine than the whole Steve Jobs uniform is one of the most calculated outfits of all time. And he, he dressed that way very publicly. But as a lot of people know, you know, he wore Birkenstocks a lot of the time around the office and he was a huge Birkenstock fan. He also went barefoot a lot. Also, who knows at this point what Steve Jobs would be in terms of who would be dressing him for the keynote. Lord knows what that would look like. I mean, but I could see him in the slip-on version of the New Balance to bridge his both worlds of, you know, being the Birk guy and the New Balance guy. Listen, I don't know. The tweet did numbers. People were fine with it. It's Twitter. It's Twitter. Don't, don't, don't fact check my tweets on this show. You, you wish he would wear them. I just think he, he was obsessed with industrial design. And that's not an industrial shoe. That shoe takes too much thought to me. I think this will be a very big hit. I think it's going to be a huge hit. Yeah. Big hit. So, New Balance was also featured in this film Challengers. So, first of all, you have already seen Challengers, the tennis movie Luca Guadagnino starring Zendaya, Mike Feist, and our boy Josh O'Connor, who we obviously both love. So why did you get to see it? Did you like ask, or are you doing a piece around it or something? Can you tell us or no? Well, at the journal, because I occasionally cover movies, I do go to screeners quite a lot. I also, I am extreme. I play a tennis. I'm very, very into tennis. I watch tennis every single day of my life. So I really wanted to see this movie. When did you get into tennis? Oh, I played it. I mean, I played as a kid. I went to the YMC tennis camp for so much of my life. But I wanted to see the movie primarily because of the clothes, which I, I, a colleague had seen it before me and had all these questions about the clothes that were worn in the movie, a colleague that does not cover fashion. So I wanted to see it. The clothes are very interesting in the movie. I think they're probably actually one of the best parts of the movie. Yes. I 100% agree. So let's talk about it. So Jonathan Anderson, the designer of J.W. Anderson, his own line, and Loewe, which is owned by LVMH and J.W. Anderson is kind of owned by LVMH. He is the actual costume designer of the movie. I thought there was going to be like a couple other people under him in the credits. He is the costume designer of the movie, how they manage that logistically since he designs like 45 collections. That's, that's a question both of us would love to ask him, but we didn't get to. So I want to talk about the costumes first. I agree that it is one of the strong, also the typeface on the, on the opening credits is really good. Two of the best things about the movie. But I thought the costumes were really interesting because it's kind of volleying between the mid 2000s or the early 2010s. They're so young, I don't even know. Like, and now, so I guess early 2010s and now. And so the clothing doesn't have, it does, it's not super connected to a time period. She wears like Zendaya and the pivotal scene, I would say, or probably like the best scene in the movie, wears a little Juicy Couture-esque Terry zip up hoodie. But I thought that to me, the best clothes were the uniforms that the guys wore or the clothes they wore when they were playing tennis. So what did you think about the costumes? My two dominant thoughts were very literal. You know, you have the Mike Feist character who is the Grand Slam champion, the tennis star, the, he's in full kit from a sponsor. You're like, he's pristine. And actually, there's a whole thing right now with tennis players that I think wear their clothes way too tight. This is like a common thing on the tour. It drives me a little nuts. This is an epidemic in our culture also. Short is good, tight is not. The clothes fit Mike Feist really well. He's, you know, kind of, it's a very clean look and it draws a very clear contrast and almost too literal contrast to Josh O'Connor's character on the other side of the net, who's in a rag tag mix of various brands. I think he's wearing like Nike plaid shorts. Nike plaid shorts. In the shirt that I couldn't idea that I should have asked you, it said impato on it. It didn't ring a bell. I don't know what that means. I am P-A-T-T-O. And I looked at, I couldn't find it anywhere. And then, yeah, the sneakers or something else, I think. I mean, he looked so good. It did bother me a little because I will just say if he was, if he was actually good enough to qualify for the US Open regularly, as the movie mentions, he would definitely have had a clothing sponsor. Like it didn't, and he would have also not been alone on the tour. There were certain things that didn't really make sense, but- The movie doesn't make sense at all. That's the spoiler is that the plot doesn't, the movie is, doesn't really, you're just like, this is dumb. It is, the plot is dumb, but also we should not care about that. But there are other issues with it that we don't need to get into. People who do this for a living can get in. There are other issues with it that, of why we're even talking about the like specifics of the movie, because you shouldn't care. They look great, but did you not think that the best, the best article of clothing in the movie, to me, was the Chanel, Espadrille flats that she wore because that to me was the most telling thing about her entire character, that she was that person that would have those shoes? A hundred percent. You are exactly right. And when I left, I went to see it with Hillary Kerr. She runs Marie Claire and who aware, which she's founded all the stuff. And when we were leaving, she was like, were you surprised she was wearing those Chanel Espadrilles? And I was like, no, because that is who that person is. And also because Zendaya looks so young, that like the only thing that could age her up are those Chanel Espadrilles. Like everything else looked a little like all the fancy stuff. I thought that she had a big Loewe bag. I thought that also worked. It was, I think it was the flamenco. And that made her look a little older, like she could be 29. But it was the age difference between her and those two guys, which is probably not that much seemed so big because they are men and she's a little girl. Like, yeah, I thought there was like a real, real obvious disconnect between the guys. I mean, the love story is between the two guys, obviously. Jonathan Anderson does the costumes for this movie and basically puts in every single brand that he works with. Like she's in Loewe. There's so much Uniclo in the movie that like Uniclo basically, it's like a Uniclo ad for part of the movie. Like they are the huge winner in this movie. Yeah. Uniclo and on running is in there. Yes. Sorry. It's just on. And also guys, terrible name for a brand if you want to search it ever. Like terrible SEO for a brand. Anyway, so this is the question. This is what I brought up last week in in line sheet was Uniclo. I was like, okay, it's going to be first of all, I texted a friend who watches a lot of, a lot of tennis. And I know Roger Federer has a big deal with Uniclo. Obviously, I know they, they stole him from Nike in 2018. It was like a giant thing. But I said to my friend, I'm like, is Uniclo like really big in tennis now because of Roger Federer? And she was like, not crazy. And what I thought was nuts was like, you so much Uniclo stuff and the first, I think the first scene and then the, the uniforms of like the people who pick the balls up or Uniclo and you're like, wow, it's going to be a Uniclo movie. How cool. But then it's like, Nike at Stanford, and then she's wearing Adidas. And then he's, he's wearing like, I guess wearing Uniclo with on running sneakers makes perfect sense because of the Roger Federer stuff who Roger Federer also has owns a piece of on running. So that makes sense. But like, were you surprised that like Nike and Adidas and I think new balance too were all in there as well? I think to me, it made me respect what Jonathan Anderson as a costume designer more because he was willing to do that. And it wasn't like when you've seen like, what's the movie? What's the Christmas Eve movie like personal shopper, which was like paid for by Chanel and she's wearing Chanel like the whole time, like it didn't feel that corny. And he's willing to say, I'll pepper in the other brands because they make sense. Yeah, I think like Uniclo in tennis, it hasn't quite landed on in tennis is a real emerging like they have Nike is seeding ground pretty quickly in tennis. Adidas has seeded a lot of ground on the men's side in particular in tennis on is picking up a lot of people. They've got Ben Shelton, they have the current world number one in women's ego shfi on tech and like they're they're making a lot of headway there. I think that's like where they're going to live for a while. And so it was interesting that he, I think Mike face character is wearing on in them. And like that made sense that totally made sense to me. Although I think the shoes he's wearing were not out yet at the time the movie took place, which bothered me a little bit. Maybe someone else could correct me on that or caught that. But that's my that was my one big nitpick. But yeah, I might be the only person that caught that but I'd be curious if anyone else did. Yeah, I think you're really the only person who would ever notice that. Yes. Well, I'm very excited for other people to see this movie. Please send me feedback and your reviews. Maybe I'll do a feedback section of reviews of challengers. Because it's totally worth seeing, especially if you're a fashion person, like it's, it's great. I'm totally and good for them that they got all those brands to agree to do it too. Because that it's very impressive. So this has been so fun. And the only thing we have left is the rumor of the week and we'll be right back.

One of the things I love to write about in Line Sheet are the things everybody's talking about offline, but maybe are a little afraid to write online. So I do it and kind of dissect it. And last week, I finally addressed these rumors that other people had also talked about the journalist Dana Thomas and a couple of other writers had mentioned that John Galliano may have had some discussions to be the new designer at Givenchy. The previous designer, Matthew M. Williams. Did Matthew M. Williams, will we ever hear from him again? And you will definitely will because he has his brand with several numbers in it. 107 ELEECS9SM. Still there. Still there. Yes. I mean, good for that guy. I only wish him the best. But so anyway, Givenchy has been without a designer. What I had heard from LVMH executives and people internally was that they weren't going to try to rush to find someone. Givenchy is a mid-level brand. It makes like $400 million a year type thing at LVMH. It doesn't really matter for their top or bottom line right now. And so they can take their time finding a new designer and make the right choice. So what I had heard during Paris Fashion Week from people who work with Givenchy was that they were like, maybe they have an amazing studio director. She's really good. Maybe they'll just elevate her. That is more of a caring move to elevate a number two and make them a star. That's not really how LVMH works. So I was a little bit surprised. But you know, again, this is not, this is a brand that can experiment with a bit. And then also during Paris, the Gian Galliano documentary High Low was being screened. I don't think it had come out yet, but people were talking about it. Galliano was around. He went to his Vogue World event. He was seen talking to Sidney Tolodano. They had sort of reconciled the last couple of years. Sidney Tolodano was the CEO of Dior when Gian Galliano was there and was fired for making anti-Semitic remarks in a cafe in Paris. So then that was about 15 years ago. So the whole rumor is that Bernard Arnaud, the CEO of LVMH and his whole crew are maybe thinking about bringing Gian Galliano to Givenchy where he started his career at LVMH. They originally hired him to design Givenchy. He did such a good job. They put him on the big brand Dior in like a year. And so it would be, if he got this job, he's currently the creative director of Maison Margiela, which is owned by another group in Italian group called OTB. And that's owned by the billionaire Renzo Rosso. So if he got this job at Givenchy, it would be really full circle. It would be like bringing him back into the LVMH fold. Maybe he could restart the Gian Galliano brand, which they own and his sort of dormant. And it would also be like his road to redemption, which has been happening in the last decade. It would be the real thing. Like it would be a huge story and super interesting. The other thing I heard after I wrote this whole thing was that Anna Wintour has been the one pushing this. I haven't confirmed that she's always pushing people she loves. So maybe it's true. Maybe it's not. I'm just curious what you think is you cover menswear, but you follow women's fashion very closely. And do you think it's a good idea for him to go there? Do you think it's even in the realm of possibility that it's going to happen? What do you think? The thrust behind this rumor, valid or not. But the reason why I think people are talking about a lot is like he's clearly on this. I mean, it's been going on for a while, but we're at a real peak of his like public rehabilitation campaign, like documentaries coming out, whether or not you think that that exonerates him or makes him look worse is I think kind of your mileage may vary on that. I think that he actually comes off looking worse in the documentary, frankly. I think he looks very much from another time as well in the documentary. Like he does not seem like a figure of modern luxury fashion. But I think I really don't know. I don't really have much of an opinion on if it makes sense. I found it really interesting at the men's Givenchy show. They really pushed. I was surprised the studio director for mens is this guy, Josh Bullen, who or Joshua Bullen, who used to be at Stone Island, and they were very, it was publicly known that that he worked on the collection, that he led the collection. It was which doesn't always happen that the studio director will be known like that. And that was really interesting to me. You know, obviously, Michael Burke was at that show. You know, you're wondering how he feels about that. Yes, Michael Burke, who is the CEO of the LVMH fashion group, the former CEO of Louis Vuitton, but he he is the big boss of the boss of the Givenchy boss. So you wonder like, you know, what is going through his mind? I had heard a different name for Givenchy at one point and was pretty confident in that different name. I don't know if they really need to appoint someone right now. As you said, it's fairly small, relatively within the portfolio. So I think that they can go along just fine with where they are. It's a brand that really though has existentially a pretty profound identity crisis. Like since Tishi, like Ricardo Tishi was there, really made the street wear high fashion moment happen. He was the spark that kind of ignited this whole wave that we've been in the Rottweiler tease, you know, the skirts on men, the sneakers that he was doing at the time. That was really like such a huge moment in fashion. And since then, the brand has been flailing through, you know, whether it needs to fully reinvent itself by going back to the archive, whether it needs a proposition similar to Tishi, which is what Matt Williams brought. You know, I like the clear way Keller years. I think similar to Tishi Matt Matt Williams was similar to Tishi. I think that you're giving him a lot of credit there. I think they thought that he was going to run a playbook. I think that they would work. I think they looked at him. I mean, you have to keep in mind he was appointed not that long after Virgil came to LV. I think they thought these guys are in the same circle. We can appoint them. I think that was a pretty profound misunderstanding of what Williams was actually capable of at a house like Givenchy, though I did really like some of those collections and will still stand by that some of them worked. Uh huh. You and no one else, but that is very nice of you. He had a few fans in the menswear world, I will say. He won a few of us over. I went to one of the men's shows and I was and I, and it was the little like schoolboy one. I liked it. I won't lie. I always thought he was the wrong fit and just wasn't the right person for that job. But I remember seeing and I thought, you know what, I like this collection. I thought it, I think he tried and he was put in a position he would have never succeeded. He wasn't right for it. And so yes. So, but go on. But the broader thing to me is that like on, at a certain level, I can see like what Galliano or someone like Galliano would do probably is totally wholesale reinvent that brand. Have it be completely different in how it positions itself. I could see a different logo, different story design. Like he could do the overhaul that I think the brand actually probably needs at this point to shed its skin and get to another level. How far they want it to go. I'm not sure. But I think for Galliano, it's probably actually also the right scale of brand for him right now. Like a grade maybe. But I don't know. You got it. You got to think. End of the day. It's like the question probably is, do we need to bring this guy back or can we find someone new? That's what they're going to be dealing with. Like does fashion really need him? I'm not, I'm not 100% sure right now. So this, I'm going to try to be as concise as possible because we could really talk about this forever. Here's what I think. One is that what John Galliano is very good at, which we saw at Dior, but also at Margiela, which you would have never, that's his contemporary. He was able to make, design Margiela and take the Margiela DNA and make it into something new, which I never imagined. This last collection was very Galliano, very Dior, but generally he has been very respective to those archives. Givenchy does not have an archive like a Balenciaga or a Dior, but it does have DNA in a black dress and dressing women in the 1950s in a particular way. And I think he is probably the most talented person or the most expert person to take an archive like the one Givenchy has and make something new into it. And what people and consumers want right now are elegant clothes and they do not get them from big luxury brands because big luxury brands are accessories brands now. And they do get them from some really much smaller brands, but they want more. They, they want dresses like women want to wear dresses right now. Givenchy is dresses. So I think on the women's side that Galliano, maybe what they would do is they would, the thing was the Givenchy business, the Tishi business was a men's business. That's why they brought Matthew Williams back. So and, and Claire Wake color, I agree. I thought she did a good job, but they need that men's business to be strong. So maybe they, they keep the men's guy and they bring Galliano to do the women's and do the tour. And here is why I think it's possible. Bernard Arnaud is going to follow the money and he's going to do things that are going to make him money. But at the same time, he is an incredibly loyal person. And I brought this up last week when I wrote about this, but you know, Mark Jacobs went through a lot when he left Louis Vuitton, they were going to try to build that business, the Mark Jacobs business into a standalone business and maybe IPO it in the US. Michael Kors had just IPOed a couple years earlier in the US and made everybody billionaires. The Mark Jacobs business really, really stumbled, but they stuck with him. Not only, I mean, it has, it's a good fragrance business, all of that stuff, but Bernard Arnaud was a loyal person and John Galliano had a huge and what you see in this, in that film, High Low, which I agree, he doesn't come off as anything, but what he is is how I would say it. But what it does show you is the birth of the luxury industry. Like as we know it today, and he was pivotal to that. And so what I think is if Arnaud and Michael Burke believe that bringing him in will not only make the money, but also is a way to sort of repair that relationship. And his brand is languishing. Like would he do Givenchy and the brand together? That seems like a lot for someone who ended up buckling under the pressure. But I think if it makes financial sense for the next five years and also it can bring these people back together. I mean, I wrote this many times, but I think Sidney Tolodano, who used to be the head of the LVMH fashion group before Michael Burke and before that, he was the CEO of Dior for many years. I think he comes across the best in the film, which is to say that like, yes, they were pushing him and driving him to make them money, but also, you know, these are all human beings. And so I think that it would be a real epic love story if he did come back. And I don't think it's anywhere near done. And I think also the OTB people, he owes them a lot now too. I mean, Renzo Rosso brought him there at 2014, when the incident only happened in 2011. That's kind of amazing that he was willing to do that. But maybe Italians are more forgiving. But yeah, it's an interesting prospect for sure. And you've got to wonder what he really wants. I mean, the thing I found so poignant in the movie is him running out of the building after the show. And it's like, he, you know, he lived it. If you believe how he phrases the story, it was all the pressure and all the anxiety and all that stress is what led to him having that anti-Semitic and racist outburst. And it's like, are you going to go back to the well? Like, like you've been, you know, doing your rehab tour. Do you want to go back to that? He doesn't, based on the movie, he certainly doesn't seem inclined to want to do that. I think he wants the public to accept him again, but maybe not through that platform, through that avenue again. Yeah, we'll see. We'll see. He is sober now. So it's a different challenge. But, you know, there's always, there's always something going on in this industry that you kind of can't believe it. It could happen. And then it does. And we start all over again. But Jacob, this is so much fun. Thanks for being here. You're going to come back on real soon, right? Maybe for Met Gala? I'll come back on for the Met Gala. Maybe I got to talk Bezos and whatever he's going to wear, you know? Oh my God. Yes. Yes. Can't wait. You know who Lauren Sanchez is wearing? Oscar De La Renta. Yeah. I have a story. I had a story about it yesterday. Read line sheet to hear all about it. Jacob, thanks for being here. My pleasure. Call them on New Balance today. We'll talk soon.
