Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Puck's Fashion and Beauty Memo Line Sheet. And today with me on the show we have Jane Pratt, founder of Sassy, Jane, ExoJane, and now another Jane Pratt thing. Let's get started. Hi everyone, I hope you had a great week. I am recording this from the back of an Uber. It's true. On the way to Puck's lunch with St. John Knitt's CEO Andy Lu at Chipriani Beverly Hills. I'm very excited for the lunch. By the time you listen to this, the lunch will be over. It will have been great because everyone who's invited is my friend and really nice and cool and smart and successful and you're gonna have a great time. I'm working right now on wrapping up Thursday's Line Sheet, which has a ton of good media intel, what went down at System Magazine, what's going on at Cond√© Nast, always, what is happening at ID, all that stuff. I also surveyed a bunch of LVMH executives and people in and around that company about those like sort of kind of sort of bad numbers and what they really mean. I think it's much more complicated and or more straightforward than people want to think. So, don't believe the headlines. It's not Doomsday, but there is change of foot. This week I've had a bunch of book promo stuff too. Thanks to everyone who came out to Skylight on Wednesday. It was nice to meet so many Puck readers and fashion people listeners. Then on Thursday night, we had or have because I'm recording this early, our West Coast Book Party. As my therapist always says, you have a lot of abundance in your life. So huge thanks to Alyssa, Max, Risa, Natalie for making that happen. I feel overwhelmed and it feels surreal, but also very special, even though nobody's special, but I do feel special and I love you all. Finally, I hope you enjoy this interview with Jane. You probably know this. If you know me or if you're running my work, she is a massive, massive inspiration for me. I've been reading her since I was nine or 10 years old and I have interviewed her before, but this interview was really special and I feel so lucky that I got to speak with her. It's good going. Jane Pratt, welcome to Fashion People. Thank you, honey. Thank you. Thanks for being here. So on our Friday mornings, the first question we ask is, what did you have for breakfast? Because I knew that was going to be the first question, I was like, I could game the system and make it something like really, really quirky and that really speaks to my personality and give you the best, most innovative breakfast thing that you've ever heard, but I didn't do that. I got from Zuckers. I forgot what the name of it is, but it's a sandwich from there that has its bale with turkey bacon, Swiss cheese, avocado, egg, and then I put tomato and lettuce on it too, and it was really good. That sounds so good. Where is Zuckers? Is that? Zuckers. Oh, they have a bunch of them around Manhattan. I don't know if they're like a chain beyond that, but there are a number of them in Manhattan. It's so good. There's stuff. I've never been there. Tastes good. That sounds delicious. I haven't eaten since breakfast and that sounds delicious. Yeah, that would do you too because it's almost like a lunch. Yeah, maybe I'll do that after I'm done with this. Do you live in Manhattan? I do. I live in West Chelsea. Have you always been there or did you ever move to Brooklyn or did you stick it out? I stuck it out and I'm still sticking it out. It's funny that I didn't, but I managed to get through my daughter going all the way through high school while we were still in Manhattan. Now she's at college and I'm still in Manhattan, so I think I'm stuck in a good way. I feel like there was a real exodus to Brooklyn in the late 2000s. I lived in Washington Heights for a year, but then I went right to Carroll Gardens. Now it feels like, I live in LA now, I moved there a couple of years ago, but now it feels like, I don't know, it feels like Manhattan is back in a way because it's so far when you live in Brooklyn. It just, everything takes so long to get to. Yeah. The other thing, God, I didn't expect to say this, but the other thing is that I'm not a subway person. Oh, interesting. I have never really been much of a subway person, but there was something, and this has had to be back in the, I'm thinking it had to be late 80s or early 90s. Anyway, there was a subway rapist, and that was my excuse. I was like, okay, I can't ride the subway. I just can't. And I've kept held onto that ever since. I just much prefer to stay above ground. So that makes Brooklyn even a little bit trickier. It's lovely to go out there and go over the bridges or whatever, but it's also a lot more time consuming. I'm also realizing right now that I did not send you your talking points. The email is waiting. I was, I was no surprises. It's basically just talking about how great you are and how you're like one of my big inspirations in life. But I'm curious what you've been up to in the last few years. Yeah. Can I just say for a second that, okay, so Lauren, I, I've been buried under my work currently on this new project, um, another Jane Pratt thing. Um, and, um, and so I had not, I had heard of this podcast and great things people said, but I hadn't listened. So I was like, okay, I'm going to go and listen to at least one or two to be respectful. And then I couldn't stop. And I binged last night. I binged almost all, every single one. There's so, it's so good. So now I feel, I feel right at home. Thank you so much. Well, you know, honestly, Jane, and I, I know I did a story with you. I don't know if you remember when you launched XO Jane for fashionista, where I was either an editor or full time. And then I got to come to your, the XO Jane launch party and at the Jane hotel. And it was, it was so meaningful to me because you, and I've said this on this podcast many times, you and Liz Tolberis are like the reason I became a fashion journalist. Like you reading my mom gave me sassy like right before you left. Cause I was probably nine or 10 and she was like, I wanted to read fashion magazines. And she said, well, this one's a feminist magazine. You can read this one. And it really helped me do, it was really fun and interesting and entertaining, but it also like helped me develop my sense of style. And then when I wanted to get into journalism, like you were just such a huge inspiration for me. And I got to interview you when you launched XO Jane, but it really is like my whole everything and like my, my tone, the way I approach it. Like you had a huge, huge impact on me and like Gigi Guera and, and Steph Trong. Yeah. These are people like when I, I'm friends with them and like I message Gigi for your email and every time I see them, I'm still like, I can't believe I'm friends with you guys because they were like celebrities to me. And they were 24 and I was 16 or whatever, but it's you, you're really amazing. And you just keep doing it again and again. I find it so inspirational. I love it so much. And you know, it's kind of funny because when, when you say that we were so much of an influence on you, it's funny because probably a lot of what I love so much about your work as I'm reading it and listening to it and everything is like, it's probably very narcissistic cause it's probably like things that you picked up from me way back. Totally. But no, you're doing it totally your own way. It's really great. 100% because I just love the fact that you were so frank and the writing was always so straightforward and, and it was so much more fun and cool that way. Maybe we can actually start from the beginning. Like how did you end up doing sassy? Mm-hmm. So I was, let's see, I was a student at Oberlin actually, even before that, when I was a total outcast at Andover, didn't fit in in any way to that place, but was at that boarding school. And that was when I first felt so alienated at 15 and had the idea that I wanted to do something that was like 17 magazine, but completely different. So I had had that idea for forever. And then I just did a ton of internships, both while I was still in college and then right after and got so incredibly lucky when the, that Australian company, why might Fairfax limited? They were called. Yeah. Yeah. They, when they decided they wanted to get into the American market, it was like a good time for magazines. This was the late eighties. Right. So they, they were like, okay, we got to, you know, we're doing well in Australia. Let's move into the American market. And they were interested in a teen magazine and somebody who I had worked, worked for at McCalls magazine. And those are like my, it was just funny to think of because these things don't even exist anymore, but recommended me and I met with them and I gave them my whole idea. And I was, I was so young that I didn't realize that's not how the world generally works, that you just have a good idea, you present a good idea and then they start the idea. Um, it was later that I learned that that was not the way that that generally happens. And how long you did it for like seven years or was it longer than that? That sounds right. I think that with every, I think pretty much every project I do, it ends up being about 78 years. Why do you think that is like other than the obvious seven year-age thing? Yeah, right. And I knew you'd think that. Um, I think, I do think there's sort of, I pour myself into them so much that I think there is sort of a burnout point or a point where I feel like, okay, I've done what I can do and I don't want to just keep repeating. So I think that's, that's part of it. So you have gone through four iterations from my memory. Maybe there is more, but like four iterations of media. So you did sassy, then you did Jane magazine, then you did XO Jane, and now you're, you're doing this, the sub stack and another, another Jane Pratt thing. Right. So, so what, like looking back on the trajectory of media, if you had to show the story of media in the last 20 years, what would you say? Like what, what do you glean from it? You know, it's funny because even when you say that, I just gave it a little bit of a, I don't say that. I just get so, the whole thing excites me so much. I feel like media is, is, you know, we can focus on the things that are, that are dying in media at any point, but I just find, but there's always something new coming and it's, and I, I just, I get really excited about it and about pursuing it and finding the new ways of reaching people. I would say, I mean, those days from starting sassy in 88 and then Jane and 97 and then left Jane and I think 2006 or something like that. So that was my, my print years. And that was, it was, it feels really simple in a way and look back at those years because it was just all so, it was all so basic and it wasn't changing that fast, right? Like, I mean, were you around for any of that phase? Like a little bit. I graduated from college in 04, but then I worked, then I moved to London and did a weird thing and worked at Forbes, which was, it's like different, but I worked, I worked interestingly, just like a little overlap with your people is that I worked for Brandon Holly at Lucky. So a lot of your people like Esther Haynes and all those people and I actually replaced Steph when she left Lucky. I like took her job. So I knew a lot of your people, but by the time I got to Lucky, it was like basically already folded. So I never got to like live and make a cool magazine, which is a little sad for me, but like I was, it was my whole world were those magazines. Like it's all I ever wanted to do. Yeah. Yeah. Totally get it. And you have the vibe of someone who understands what those were, even though you didn't live producing them yourself. Thank you. But I, yeah, you do. You do your old magazine soul in that way. It did feel like it was, it was simpler. It was like, because it wasn't digital, everything was just real hands on from when I first started at Sassy. We actually did the layouts on these white, big cardboard oversized pages. We would actually glue down the photos where we wanted them. I remember there was one story where we decided to do an art treatment that would look like a car tire tracks running over the story. So we actually went out onto the street, got tire tracks outside of our offices from some, you know, muddy car that drove by and brought it back up and put it over the layout. And, and if things dropped off sometimes on the way to the printer, they could, you could risk that a paragraph would be missing or something from your article. It's crazy. And that's how that's also that got me in trouble because we did this thing, the sassyist girl in America contest. And, and it was sponsored by L'Oreal. So it was, you know, big, like a lot of sponsorship stuff around, around that title and the s got lost in the gutter of the, the binding of the magazine. So it looked like the assiest girl in America contest. And that was a really not, yeah, it's not go over. Did you have a lot of pushback from advertisers? Like was, was dealing with them extremely hard or like, what was your relationship dealing with that part of the business? Yeah. I mean, I made it extremely hard for myself because this is especially sassy. Sassy. I was just, you know, I was a brat. I was so, I was 24. I was a brat. I was like, I, I just wanted to tell the readers what I wanted to tell them. And I didn't, I didn't want to answer to the advertisers or the, or even their parents or their teachers as to what they should be seeing. So, so advertising was a nightmare at sassy because we, we started out strong. And then because of stuff that I published that the advertisers didn't like or that they got, they got hate mail on from some right wing groups. They, we lost our, we lost our 15 biggest advertisers all in one fell swoop after about our third or fourth issue. So that was, yeah. Not, not brand safe. Not, we're the opposite of brand safe. And that's one reason when I started Jane magazine is that I wanted to show that I could do something that could be also commercially viable, not just, not just make it, make it smart editorially. And it was for a good 10 years, right? And then like the world fell apart around the time you left Jane. That's right. Yeah. That's right. It did do, it did do well for a while. Obviously Jane, you, you had much more experience and it was sort of targeted towards an older consumer, although I'm sure tons of teenagers read it too. What was your like big idea with Jane that was different from what you did with sassy? Yeah. Okay. So this is so funny because I had to think of this again recently with another Jane Pratt thing is this idea of some kind of mission statement because even with sassy, I never had a clear one sentence or even few sentence mission statement. I always had to describe it based on what else was out there in the world at the time and how, and what we weren't, which is not a good mission statement way to do things. But I kind of crafted something about the way we were talking to teenage girls differently. And then with Jane, the idea behind that was that I had all these readers that were aging out of sassy and saying to me, you know, it's a little bit embarrassing. I'm hiding my sassy inside my copy of Vogue because I'm really too old for it now. And so there, it seemed like there was a natural audience that grew out of sassy that would not necessarily want to go to the cosmopolitan of that time or the glamour or whatever the other options were because of, because of the sassy influence. So Jane was for the older sassy years to graduate into. What's the idea? How did you approach the fashion pages compared to, like, because you wasn't, it wasn't like, like I mentioned Harper's Bazaar, it wasn't like Harper's Bazaar, but it also wasn't like Cosmo or any like wit or glamour or any of the quote unquote women's magazines. Like it had an edge to it. How did you like find fashion editors? Were you, were you deeply involved in like figuring out what kind of concepts you all would do? Did you do a lot of shoots? Like I don't remember a ton of like editorial shoots. Maybe there were and it just wasn't what I was focused on at that time. But I love these questions so much it gets me so excited. OK, first of all, you're and you're talking more about Jane magazine at this point, right? Not so much sassy. OK, so Jane magazine because the company that I I went around and I pitched it at I talked to James Truman at Cond√© Nast. He was an old friend and I'm just throwing out these names as though you know who these people are. But I think I know of him for sure. Yeah. OK, so he was what editorial director. I'm a student of Cond√© Nast. So I have to know these things. And good, good, good student. And what, you know, talk to somebody at hers, talk to a couple of different places. But then the company that ended up that I ended up launching Jane magazine with was owned by what was all under Bob Iger. It was owned by ABC, but it was Fairchild. Oh, yeah. So they had that. So we our sister publication was W magazine at that time. And and obviously women's wear daily and all that was part of it. So so that partly because of that, the focus on fashion was even greater at Jane than I probably would have made it on my own. But I what I did was I hired away the the fashion team that was at Marie Claire under Glenda Bailey at that time. And so throwing names out. But it was someone named Shasha Gambachini. That name I have never heard. That's the first one. OK. Interesting. I wondered I wondered how far I could go till you. OK. Shasha. So I lost you at that one. Shasha, she was brilliant. And she brought her entire team from Marie Claire to do. I could tell you things that would make you say, oh, I know who she is. I know her entire team, though. Yeah. So they all came over to work on Jane. And I really get between them and I'm going to throw out another name. Dennis Friedman, who was then. Yeah, OK. So he was creative director at W and of overseeing Jane. So between his connections with photographers that did our fashion and between this and with this fashion team that had, you know, incredible relationships with models and with with the fashion houses and everything, the fashion was definitely more high end than the editorial was. But I kind of like that. I like showing these aspirational images and then having the the text on the page where they were describing what is actually in the picture, the very spoken sounding and almost surprisingly. So did you go to a lot of fashion shows or did you not? Did you avoid that racket? I did. I went to I loved it. I had never done that before. Sassany was not part of that at all. And and at first I I remembered the first season where the fashion team wanted me to go to Europe to the shows with them. And I was kind of complaining and I was asking people, do I really have to go do this? I have so much work to do here in New York on this magazine, on the editorial part of it. And then, you know, a few people said, yeah, you should you should go. And boy, was I glad I did. That was fun times. I mean, you know, you know, it's work too. But but especially as an editor-in-chief, who doesn't actually have to make anything out of what I'm watching. Totally. Like it's pretty fun. It was really nice. So I did go to all those shows for a number of years. Is there one that you remember that was really awesome or special or you were excited, just excited to be there? Oh, great question. Gosh, I come I think of a million different things. I think of one that was I think it was a Fendi show. But I'm thinking of how the characters then it was such a everybody at those shows. And maybe it's still like that because I don't go now. But everybody was such a character. And so I remember one where the editor, Paulie Mellon, jumped up at the end of the runway and did a touchdown. Oh, my God, like signal with her arms because it was so good. And I was like, what? That's amazing. Yes, it was beautiful. And that was the kind of excitement and quirkiness that was going on that I just loved it. Oh, man. I loved it. Yeah, I think like now there aren't as many people who go and it's also really celebrity heavy. It's still fun. And I like I really do think it helps with my job to go to them. Sometimes I'm like, should I stop doing this? But it really does just like sitting with people and talking to them at the shows is is valuable. And then seeing the close in person is valuable. But yeah, it doesn't feel as it doesn't. It's not a trade thing anymore. It's really about the marketing. So there's like a lot of people there who you don't have to interact with day to day. And so it does create a different, less clubby. And I mean, clubby in almost a good way, vibe, like the equivalent of polymellan if there is one is not doing that, unfortunately. Right. Right. That's sad. That's yeah, that's too bad because that was a really that was a fun and special time. But I get that and I get that about going for me also going to the shows. It was really like a golden time to be able to brainstorm with my team and we'd come up with some of the best ideas there. There's another thing I don't know why I feel compelled to say this. And you can definitely cut this out because it's so it's so strange. I have such a need to confess things, but I'm just going to go for it. OK, so then there was one of my early shows at Armani where he had those white seats lined up. OK, you know what I mean? I think he's still they're black now. But yeah, and it's in like his little space that they've built just for fashion shows. Exactly. His own unique way of doing the whole thing. Right. I got my period on one of those white things. And I could I thought it was horrifying because I was right there in the front. I was had Linda Wells on my left. I can't remember who was probably Hal Rubenstein or somebody was on my right. It was it was really not a cool thing. I got up and I was like, oh, shit. But the weird thing was that when I went back the next season, the stain was still there. I would have thought they would have gotten rid of it. Oh, my God, that's hilarious. We're definitely not cutting it. And of course, it happened to you. It happened to Jay Pratt. It's so funny. That's hilarious. I mean, there's such a weird couple of seasons ago, everybody got bedbugs. I didn't. But it was like this big thing that like so many people got bedbugs in Paris and like couldn't go to work for four weeks afterwards or two weeks or whatever. It's like it's such it really is like high school or back to school. And you're with these people for four weeks and you see them every day. And you're like, I hope I'm not seated with that person. And or or you're excited to be seated with them. Yeah. You ever hit that moment when your kid asks for help with homework and you're like, wait, when did Long Division get this complicated?

When you were doing Jane, you were so good at sort of like, and you are so good at like, because you get to the sort of core of what people actually want to talk about. I feel like that whole era in the 2000s that now it was just like me being in my early 20s, but now everybody talks about being indie sleaze or whatever. You and your editors and like, you were very much a part of that, whatever the culture that was happening during that time. Did you feel it happen? Because now we can see it happening, but could you put a box around the sort of way people were making things and the way creative people were acting during that era? Like, could you see that there was a sort of movement going on? If that makes sense, does that make sense? I don't know. It does. I'm thinking about it because I'm thinking that we were sometimes the influencer in it and sometimes soaking it up from other people. But yeah, I mean, I feel like I don't know if I'm exactly answering what you're getting at, but I do feel like to me the thing about having my editorial eye on the pulse of what is going on is it's so much, and I feel like more and more magazines did this at that Jane Magazine time. It was so much about looking beyond the magazine world and really just listening to the way people talk and making sure that everything was read real. And this is long before people started saying authentic, which is like the opposite of real, but really just making sure that we weren't magazineizing things, that we were presenting them really the way that they really were. It's interesting because now working on this, another Jane Pratt thing, isn't that weird for me to say that? Like third person, I'll start calling it something different. I'll do shorthand or something. But working on that, I still find it though, it still comes up almost all of the, and I have amazing editors and writers, and it still comes up these phrases and things that are not really the way someone would say them or that maybe got influenced by other publications or something. So yeah, did you ever, did Deb Schwartz ever work for you? Yeah, but I know that name so well, but I'm blanking. She was an editor who would come into Lucky occasionally when I worked at Lucky, and she was the first person who really, I always knew all those dumb cliches were not good to use, but she was like, we gotta not use these cliches. She taught me how to eponymous, that word is never used properly. Like she would say, don't use, a big thing during that era was like pop of color was a big phrase. And right like you talk is the best advice, but you really, you pioneered that and also the way the internet works now, like you were just, everything you did was proto of that. And so it's funny, like looking on your site now, a lot of it, like you're using a lot of the same sort of feature boxes like it happened to me, that type of thing, but like it's still so straightforward and straight to the point. And so, which makes it so much more potent. And so, I don't know, it's, I mean, you've done, you've trained so many people, but on the other hand, when you read the copy at a lot of these more general or more traditional publications, they still fall into that stuff. I know, you're right. It's, I wonder like, in some ways, I think you've changed language, but in other ways, like there are these people, why do you, do you think it's just because people are tired and they, they're not confident enough? Did you, do you feel like you always had like a real confidence in your ideas? And that's why you were able to communicate so clearly? I do think that's a part of it. And I think also that things get diluted to very, it's easier to just get used to saying things a certain way and go ahead and say it that way, rather than trying to actually picture yourself or actually saying it out loud and thinking, would I say that if I were just talking to a friend? Because most of the time, no way. Even when I was writing my first newsletter for another Jane Pratt thing, I thought, this is actually going to, and we're so small right now, it's basically is going to just my friends, but, but it's going to my friends and I don't want any of my friends to pick it up and read it and be like, wait, who is this person talking to me? It should read as though I'm just sending them another email, just like I sent them one last night or whatever. So, so it's a constant, but I, you know, I can fall into that too. It's also funny how, how, and I don't, I don't take full credit for that, for that spoken thing, but it was a big, big part of what I started at Sassy and yeah. Were there any writers you were inspired by? Like, how do you, how did you decide that you were going to approach your work that way? That's really interesting. I think that I was a little influenced by when I was working on Sassy, getting, getting the ideas together for it. There were, there were some magazines that were British or Australian magazines at that time, women's, women's magazines type thing. You could tell they weren't as polished as the, as their American counterparts. They probably had smaller teams and so they weren't completely, perfectly copy edited and, and they would sometimes just fall into a tone that I, that would strike me every time as, oh, this is really real. This is really how people talk. And so I think I might have gotten a little bit of inspiration from that and just wanted to carry it through the whole thing. It was funny too, because I saw, well, your friends with Marissa Meltzer, right? Or you, you know each other. Yes, yeah, yes. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So our friends. I was looking at the books she did about Glossier. This just goes back to the whole thing about the language. And I saw that someone who had worked with me at Exo Jane and then went to work there had, had given everyone a list of the words not to use, like in, instead of nails, you have, you don't ever use talons or for hair, you don't use tresses and you don't use Maine and all that and it was my list, exactly my list. I was like, Oh my God, like it really is getting, it really gets passed around. And that's, I mean, I think good, the fewer tresses in the world, the better. I agree. Oh man, tresses, that one is rough. I, I've never used that. I hope. Don't, don't Google Lauren Sherman and trust. So this is your second in internety thing. So you did Exo Jane and was that like 13 that you launched 12 or 13 that you launched that? I think it was, I think it was 12. Yeah. And what would you say, I mean, the internet has changed quite a bit since, but like what, what would you say the differences are between this project, another Jane Pratt thing and Exo Jane and how have you evolved? Like what are you trying to do this time around? Yeah, thank you. I think that what this, this feels more like a hybrid of what I did do in print and and what I did in purely digital with Exo Jane because not because this is in print also, but because the piece at the time that I was doing it, so Jane, we were posting 15, sometimes 20 pieces of original content every day and people just aren't doing that now. So I don't have to compete with that to be able to get seen. And so I've been able to do, there were, there were things that went up on that. So Jane that I, I mean, I can't even believe that was something that was a time of blogging, bloggy blogs. When you were, I was posting 15 blogs a day. I understand. I was just like, what can I do? Yeah, exactly. I mean, most of the stuff I didn't even read before it went up because who would have time to read all of that and all of that and just and do all the other parts of the job. So it was just, it was just like constantly fixing things after they went up and that kind of thing. Yeah. But so this feels different in that. And I think partly because the editors that I have working on it, people are, we are really taking our time and working with every post that goes up in a more of a print like way somewhere in between and even taking more time with the art. I don't do pickup art. I do only original art just because I think when you're for that reality thing, if you're, you need to see the person, the actual person who's telling the story, not a model or someone else looking like they're in a similar story. So because of that, we, you know, we take the time to do that and we haven't even shot anything that's fashioned yet, but, but we are going to be doing more of that too. So, so it has a little bit of a print. Yeah. What was the, I love the art direction. What was that? And I want to talk to you about Substack because I saw you mentioned about the fonts, but what, like, what is the art direction inspired by? Cause it feels like a little bit like tabloid, but in a very specific way. I'm curious if you took inspiration from certain things. Yes. Okay. Amazing that you, that if you like it at all, that's phenomenal to me because I did have a really specific vision for it. And, and back before it was called another J-Prat thing when it was called Dita, when I was working on it back then, I have mockups from that that were exactly how I wanted it to look, which I couldn't completely achieve on Substack, but I did get the general, the vibe over. And the funny thing is, I looked at, this is so typical for me now that I'm saying it, I realize I've done this a million times, but I had some designers try logos and things for me that were, that were really good, but I needed something that was more raw. So what I did was, I hooked up with Ani for Lisi, who's kind of a newcomer. She's one of my writers and editors now, but I had met her in a totally different capacity. And she just got what I was looking for and went on Canva and, and we did the colors together and we did the, that tabloid-y kind of look. It's exactly, I wanted it to look kind of messy and kind of urgent so that it wasn't quiet. It was, I wanted it to be the opposite of those line hand, hand, those, what do you call, what are those, those line drawing things that they do like in the Wall Street Journal or Free Press does? I know, I never can remember the name of them either. It's called, it's something with an S. There's like, yeah, I know what you mean. It's not Stipple, but yeah, it's not Stipple, but yeah, there's like a very particular name for them. I know what you mean. Okay, so that, so, Wall Street Journal, all those places do it. They do that, exactly. So I wanted to be really the opposite of that because, I mean, that has, obviously, has its place for sure. I, I wanted it to be much more raw and again, real than that. So so not, not remote and not refined, not refined. That's exactly what I didn't want. So I think we kind of got that with these crazy layouts that we did. Yeah, it's so fun. And it feels like of this time, which is what you're so good at. But why did you want to do this? Like, did you have you raised money to start this? Like, why did you want to do it again? Because I'm sure that like, you can consult and do that and that can be your life and, and you don't have to put yourself out there like this. Like, what, what motivated you this time around? And how did you like, get the business off the ground? Thanks for asking. I, you know, at every, at every stage, after Thassie Magazine, after Jane Magazine, after XO Jane, I've had to take a hard look at, do I want to go and let's say be an editor under another editor in chief? Or do I want to go or be a consultant, as you said, that kind of thing. And I don't think I, I don't think I would be that good. I think I'm so much better at what I do this way. And it's so much more satisfying to me. So I just keep doing these startups and, and doing them the way that I, the way that I want to do them. And it's not necessarily the best formula for stability or, or, you know, whatever. It creates a lot of, half like in my own life, that I'm, that I'm sort of always, I don't know what I'm doing next, or now I'm doing this, now I'm doing that. But, but, but I just, I, yeah, I love doing it. And I keep going back to it. There's nothing I love more, really, other than my daughter. Of course.

Are you self-funding it? Like how are we doing? Oh yeah. Yeah. So yeah, you asked good stuff about that too. Okay. So got to follow the money, Jane. Yeah, absolutely. It's important. Originally, when I was doing this with my business partner, who where we were doing Dita and developing that together, the idea there was that it was going to be a platform to sell her products. So that was being funded that way. Yes, I remember that. And she was wonderful and I still hope to sell her products on what I'm doing now. But it started to make less sense for what, it started to make more sense for both of us to do our things separately and then see if it made, if it worked to come back together. Because yeah, it was a little stymie for me editorially and then for her, she could reach more people in other ways at that point. So I, what the big realization, because I was talking to other people about ways to get it started. And then the realization that I watched what some of these other newer publications did. And I think Puck actually kind of fits into this mold, but I'm not quite sure. But where like the guys that started Defector, for example, where they left and just did it and just put the work in and made it work her own basically, right? Yeah. Is that the right term? Yeah. Yes. Yeah, like equity, equity part to it for sure. Yeah. So that, so what, so I thought, wow, that would be amazing if I can do that. And I can, and if people want to be, if other editors want to be part of it with me, I will split everything evenly with them. So initially it was going to be two other editors, then it came to three other editors. And so we're just, we're dividing everything 25% each. And I love it. It feels great. It's, it's everybody's really motivated to work on it. Yeah, we'll see how that continues and how it grows. But it's, it's really satisfying. And, and it's satisfying that I don't, I'm not saying that I would never take sponsorships or ads or create other revenue streams. And I'm definitely working on some products that I, but for the most part to have it funded by the readers is like, that's like a throwback to, to my print days, when, I mean, that was very advertiser funded as well. But, but the idea that how many people were willing to pay for an issue of Sassy or a subscription to Sassy was the make or break. So it's again, the make or break. Yeah. Yeah, I think that that's what's interesting about what's happening right now is all this stuff was free forever and shouldn't have been. And now people are giving it a value. And so it's going to be tricky for like a while to figure out, you know, what value does this stuff have and how much does advertising, what role does it still play? Is it complimentary or is it dominant and all that stuff? But the fun part of it is you can start something, it's the direct to consumer economy, you can start something, and then you see, but you can start something with three people and it can work and be exciting and something that people, you can start something with one person that can work. And it's, it's, um, it's very exciting. What, how has it been your exp... So the one thing I noticed as you said, the, that the fonts on Substack, and that's the thing to me that I really like working. I love, I love Puck because it's like a mix of I have equity in the company, I'm motivated by subscriptions, all that stuff. But I also have like health insurance and a base salary. And it's a, it's a big group of people I like working in a newsroom with people who don't write about what I write about all that stuff. But so like those are big reasons I decided not to do a Substack type thing. But like the other thing is the design part of it is, is challenging. How have you, as a person who obviously cares a lot about that and can communicate a lot through the design of whatever product you're making? Like how, how are you thinking about it through the lens of, of Substack? Yeah, I mean, all the people that I'm working with at Substack and what they're bringing to this, I love, I'm so appreciative. I love it. It's better than I thought that it was even going to be. But having said that, I was really, I was struggling because I do like to have things designed the way I want them. And I think there are good reasons and I like to name certain things not to not name it most popular, but to name it most, you know, most clicked on or whatever it might be, I might have my own language for things that I want it, that I, that is important to me to use. And I definitely didn't want it to look, I didn't want it to look identifiably Substack, even though I love Substack, it's just not what I wanted to do. So that was a lot of that process of working with Ani on the design to try to make it as unique as we could. But also, this sounds so bad, but I also had known, and I think we all knew, that there was another editor years ago who had started something on Substack and got to design it exactly the way that she wanted. And it doesn't fit their, you know, what they're doing now, their template that I had to use. So I was really like, you know, I was just such a proud about it. I was like, what? Why can't I get this changed? Why do I have to have weight space around that top headline? Why does it have to look so grid like, you know, these, all these kinds of things. But they, they stuck by their guns understandably, they have a great business going. And, and so I, so I just figured it was worth it and worked with it. And yeah. So what, what's the next plan for it? Like, how has the response been to start? And how are you feeling? Are you getting like, it's nice because I think Substack has a really amazing community of reader response and people are really engaged in a way that they're no longer engaged in the internet. Like, what has your, what's your experience been so far? Yeah, that is such a good, and I really hope it, I hope it doesn't come across. I really am, I'm thrilled with Substack and also beyond my own thing, I'm thrilled with what they've done for so many other writers and I guess we say content creators now. So yeah, I think it's a really, I think as a business, I think it's great and the people are great. I think what was my, what was the question? How it's going to, how's it going? And what like, what, yeah, like what's the feedback then? How's it feeling doing it again? Yeah, well, I think one of the things that works, that does work really well for me is that as you said, they do have, they have a pretty engaged and high commenting community there. And for me, like I didn't even care about, I used to do a newsletter at ExoJane, but I barely did anything with it. I think I wrote one sentence at the top and then pinned some stories. And so to me, the formats that I think that I work well in are not, not a newsletter format and not a website where people read it and take in what you're saying but don't have their own responses to it so much. And so I like the conversation part. That's the part that really gets, that is exciting to me is just putting out anything and just seeing what, how, how the audience and the community responds. And that is starting to build and I'm looking forward to more and more of that because that's really the fun for me. That's, yeah. Well, I'm excited to be a part of the community. I'm subscribed under my married name email. So Lauren Fromer, I'm there. Oh, good. Yeah. Yeah, that's where I would put all my good stuff. Thank you, Lauren Fromer. Of course, Jane, this was such a pleasure. I'm the hugest fan. I hope we get to meet again in person soon. And thank you for doing this. I know I'm going to get about 45,000 texts from people saying, oh my God, Jane, oh my God, Jane. And also, Steph Trong sending me a 5,000 word message about it. I love her. Well, thank you so much for having me and just for keeping the standards up in all of these media. Really. Yeah. I'm trying, but I couldn't have done it without people like you. So thank you again.
