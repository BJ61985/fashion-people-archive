If I didn't respond to you, please know that I am really grateful and that my family and I are okay. And I hope you are okay too. And I hope you find this revealing interview with Christopher to be something of an escape from the real world.

Run this week. I'm online. So if you need something or you think there's something I should be writing about around these fires or anything else, message me. I will respond if I see it and I'm just sending love to everyone. Christopher Cain, welcome to Fashion People. Hi Lauren, how are you? I'm so well. Thank you for being here. Yes. How many podcasts? Maybe my second podcast. So yeah, pretty podcast version at this point. I'm so honored and you know, I think you and I are around the same age and so I sort of grew up in journalism as you grew up in fashion and a lot of my fashion writer friends who were with me in those early days and we were going to your shows in London in 2010 or what have you are going to be so excited about this. It's like you're, I think you're only the second designer I've had on the show. Oh no, gosh. Yeah. So it's no, no, no, no. So on our Friday morning, the first question we ask is what did you have for breakfast? I don't actually eat breakfast. I'm not a big breakfast person. It really slows me down. I've always been like, I'm just like a good strong coffee gets me going and yes, no, I'm not a breakfast person. What time of day do you normally start when, when is your first meal or snack or something? I'll probably have something around half to three o'clock. Okay. So wait lunch, yeah. Wow, okay. Wow. Okay. Yeah. I'm in this room of mine. It works for me. I'm not a big lunch person either. I like to really be quite on it and when I do eat, I tend to become quite sluggish. So I'd rather just have a full day work and it keeps me going. Yeah. That's interesting. I feel that way. Sometimes I'm just so hungry that it's also about what you eat. Yeah. There's so many different things, but it feels like also the European way is very much like big lunch or a big dinner and then you're kind of. I mean, I changed a whole like a long time ago, like maybe six years ago, I started functional medicine. So I tend to fast a lot and it really works for me. I suffer with like, I mean, some like little autoimmune diseases, like psoriasis. So getting rid of the psoriasis was something to do with the gut. It's nothing fashion related, but for me, it was obviously stress and the industry we work in, fashion is a very stressful job. So I had to do a little changes to get rid of the psoriasis and it's went away. So yeah. So when did your, that's interesting. We should talk offline because the, yeah, those dry skin, my husband suffers. His hands are like terribly dry. And we've, yes. And we thought he had psoriasis forever and he would go and they would give him steroid cream and obviously that really doesn't do anything. And then he went to like a good dermatologist here in LA and she was like, you don't have psoriasis, you just wash your hands too much. More that could be a cause because it's detergents, so like acidic and astringent. Yeah. And it was funny. I asked him how many times he washed his hand and it was crazy. I was like, that's a good thing. He's a clean boy. We need to be hygiene. Yeah, I guess so, but it's making his hands all dry and cry. Anyway. It's all the time you, especially psoriasis when it comes to stressful jobs and stressful lifestyles, but yeah. Man, stress, stress, stress. But so how did you get into the stressful industry? Were you obsessed with fashion growing up or did you? So I know you went to St. Martens and you're a Louise Wilson person and that history, but how early did you start like wanting to design and designing? I'm Lauren ever since I can remember I was always watching fashion or my sister, Tammy, who's five years senior. She was always wearing fashionable clothes. I come from a very working class background in Scotland. So people strangely tended to look really good and dressed up really well. They worked really hard and made good money and they would spend on great fashion. Like there was obviously the Italian center in Glasgow. So people were really wearing fashionable for satchit or mani. There was the first living westwood consignment in Glasgow. So there's all these amazing things happening in Glasgow and my community. So besides that, I had a fascination with TV. I always watched TV and I was very influenced by TV from, I suppose, the world of biology, nature to discovering Sky Television, which brought into the world of Jeannie Becker fashion TV. And I became addicted and started recording it. And I learned probably so much from that and basically my obsession began. Was Tim was fashion file Tim Blanks on Sky as well? No, he was more, I never really got to see Tim, but I saw Jeannie and I saw Elsa Clench. So these are the people that were on like the news channels and you would have a Saturday morning where I'd get the VHS machine and record. So it's like, obviously, as I'm doing this call, I heard of Paulie Mellon just passed away. And so I learned about Paulie Mellon when I was probably nine years old, watching these. So I learned a lot of great things from fashion TV. Oh my God, this is such a big morning. So Paulie Mellon passed away. She was 101, I think she was 100. Yeah, yeah. Wow. Incredible, incredible woman. And then we were talking about this will run in a few weeks probably, but we are recording the morning of all the changes at Bottega and potentially the Chanel news announcements. So it may come in as we are speaking this morning, Luis Trotter left Carven and then Bottega Veneta announced that Matu, is it blazy or a blase? I see it blazy, but it's max. Matu, Matu blazy is leaving Luis Trotter's joining and I reported on this a couple weeks ago, or actually last week. But so it's interesting, it's such a crazy news morning for this. But I grew up, I watched Jeannie as well. I never really watched Elsa Clench, which is weird because I'm American and that would have been easy for me to access. But in America, more people had cable. I feel like when like in the UK, a lot of people just still only have the five channels. Which was kind of interesting as well because there was great shows in Channel 4. Channel 4 was doing amazing things when it came to LGBTQ2. LGBTQ2, oh God, that's terrible. I don't know what to say there, how to say it. But there was always these amazing gay films and gay programs and also Jean-Paul Gaultier was on EuroTrash. So TV in the UK was quite at the forefront. Wait, what's EuroTrash? I don't know about that. Oh gosh, EuroTrash, you need to YouTube it. Jean-Paul Gaultier had a show which was very like, I mean, it was so progressive for the time. It was him co-hosting and it was all around sexual activities of the Europeans and all this crazy stuff. When you Google it, you're going to be like, wow, this is kind of amazing. So I grew up watching that. So education was at the forefront, but TV was definitely number two. Yeah. So my grandparents had cable. We would intermittently have cable and I would watch Tim on the weekends. So like, it's crazy to me still that I know him. I mean, it's insane, isn't it? And I've never met Jeannie, but I've DM'd her. So it's like one of those things where you're like, oh my God, Phil's so cool. But it was strange because I grew up in a very normal town, very, it was a steel industry. Village, very small. My mum was never fashionable, but I mean, for me, she looked very fashionable in the sense that she was very simple. Whereas my sisters were always very fashionable. They were going out to discos and stuff. So they were always dressing up. But I suppose when you first saw your helmet, Langshaw at the age of nine or 10, you were literally like, what the hell is going on here? Why is she wearing a bin bag and like white tights and looks phenomenal? So that was the sense that I was getting that these goosebumps mean something more than just like, what is this feeling I'm having? So yeah, it was pretty insane. How did you end up at St. Martin's? So it was like a long term plan or was it, did you apply on a whim? I always knew again from watching these TV shows, I'm sure it was a Jeannie Becker special where she interviewed Hissain Chalian. And, oh wow. Obviously there was people talking about the McQueen and the Galliano, but I was much more of a Hissain boy because I mean, a dress that turns into an aeroplane or a table. Like that really got me and it was almost like a transformer-esque moment where I was like, wow, this is fashion. So that for me was like, St. Martin's was always in the background ringing. Ding, ding, ding. And it was, I applied when I was 17, 16 and a half, 17. And I went to St. Martin's when I was 18 and did a foundation there. Then I did the BA, then I did the master's. So in total it was six years at St. Martin's. Oh wow. Yeah. And did you, how do you, because one of the things we met a couple of months ago at a party. And one of the things that I said to you is you are one of the last designers who I think of as having like an original, you're not, you don't seem, there are designers who are really good at taking inspiration from a lot of other people and making it their own. And that is a talent and incredible, but you, what you do feels completely germane to who you are. And that is, you're just so original. When did you start developing your idea of what you were as a designer? And what kinds of references and things like do you, are you drawn to? Well, I'll take you right back and to the MA where I was working with Louise Wilson. And obviously she's very well known for being this notorious leader and tyrant. But for me, Louise was the ultimate entaste maker. And she knew everything about fashion and art. So to impress Louise was, I mean, that was a pedigree. So I would literally be in a studio where students were mimicking or copying the looks of Margera or Côme de Garçon. Whereas I was back home with literally 50 quid, which is like $40 or something. And I was buying lingerie and stockings and cutting them up. It sounds really perverted, it was. It sounds really strange. But it was what I could afford. And I was buying them from the market. And I was making these bodycon dresses sort of inspired by American pageants. Those really bonker dresses that are literally covered in frails and rhinestones. And for me, they just felt so right and so like the opposite to what everyone else was doing. Because they were so they were just complete vulgarity. And for me, that's something I've always done. I've always looked at places where people don't think is beauty. Whereas I love that investigation. And for me, showing Louise that first dress was the most terrifying but the most electric feeling I've ever had. Where I put it on the model, she's smoking a cigarette and she says, making all the fucking sexities. This is fucking fabulous. And it was like, fucking. She just kept saying the word fucking. Sorry, guys. So for me to like be hidden away in a bedroom to then come in and show her this, it was like, oh. So I wasn't on my instincts telling me something different. Was she as harsh as people? Yeah. And so either way, like if she was complimenting or if she was she was just going to say it super straight. She was saying it super straight, but also it's the thing where she would always pay a compliment, but then she's stabbing the back. And she was basically saying, this is what happens in the real world. And this is honestly what working in fashion is like. You have to be, there's always someone prettier, skinnier, taller, better than you. So you always have to be 100 steps ahead. And it's true. Like it's just, it's a very competitive industry and you just need to be in top form. And from that moment, I've been very agile, almost like private detective. I always watch what's happening in the room. I'm always very conscious of what's happening and very open and on all the time. And that's something I learned from Louise because she was like, you need to see what's going on. You need to literally dig deep to find something new and never be derivative. But also you don't want to be seen as being in the middle either because when you're in the middle, you're forgotten about. You'd rather be haters or loved in the middle is literally just like forget about it. So strive for both with the other ones. Yeah, I feel like I don't, I'm not a creative person, but I see what you do. And for someone like you, I wonder, is it possible for you to feel fulfilled if you're not like totally living your truth, which will be polarizing? Like when you, when people live their truth, when people don't live their truth, it tends to, maybe you get a little attention, you don't get enough, but you, in order to get people to like make an impact, you have to like totally put yourself out there. And that's, I mean, that, that takes a lot of emotional, that's a lot of emotional labor. Yeah. And I think it's like going in this authentic power and I think being authentic always rings true and people always, they understand or they come to understand. And I have, I've had editors who have been like, oh, I didn't get it then, but I get it now. And I'm like, well, you should have gone then, but that's okay. But like you're saying, like I do see my influence in a lot of runways still and that's okay. I take it as a form of flattery, but I am always working. I'm always working in my head and I'm always drawing because I'm always keeping the muscle going. And I think it's really important in this industry to always keep looking and searching. And for me, that's the best part. Your career is sort of like, so it's the example, especially of the British designers of like that era of fashion and your trajectory, which we can go through a little bit. But when you first started out and started showing and you were in, you were in this London scene, you were definitely at the top of the group, but this scene of young designers coming up in London that was sort of paralleling what was happening in New York, although that was always as usual, more commercially driven. But there was just a real energy, like I lived in London from 04 to 06. And I think I went to like two fashion shows, but the fashion week wasn't a thing. And then like a year later, it was huge. What was it like being in that world where you were doing projects with collections with Donatella Versace? You were the name coming up. It was this time when like LVMH in the late 90s had hired Mark Jacobs and Narcisa Rodriguez and Michael Corzan. Now there was going to be another generation and you were always like a name to do one of the big houses, caring, invested in your company. Like what was it like being there at that time when there was so much energy and enthusiasm and pressure to make it into a business? I mean, when I first started my business, it was very the unknown. There was no such thing as like a huge setup of support. There was definitely no social media back then. So literally you were really depending on reviews, critics, and the buyers coming through the door. So you really had to have a voice and an identity that stood apart from everyone else. So creativity was really valued. And I don't mean that like having something new to say, but it was like, I don't know, it was just you had to have this real identity that really stood apart from all other brands and especially the bigger brands because you were literally, I was showing up against bigger brands like Aprada and I was being compared to these brands in reviews and it was really quite, it was flattering, but I don't have millions of pounds for a budget. I was doing it from the back of a lorry in the market or buying fabric from here or upcycling things or it was just, but that's how I flourished and that's where I got the kicks from. But obviously, when caring, invested, it was great. It was a great opportunity, but a lot of things happened there too. And I learned so much and I've never really seen anything as a failure and that's how I am here today still working in the industry because you learn a lot and that's a good thing. But fashion back then was different, Lauren, as you know, you were in London. London was known for this creative hub, but there wasn't really much happening when I started. It was maybe the Barbourier, the Pulse Smith, but young people were like definitely coming up from there at Scourge, like myself, Marish, Schwab. So we were kind of doing something that people didn't want to talk about, which was like sexy dressing or body cone. I mean, it was really bizarre. It was still people still cringe when you say sexy. I'm like, yeah, that's okay. It's bizarre, that whole concept around sexy dressing. But yeah, so we were doing something that really made people set up and take no ones. Yeah, it's interesting you mentioned the idea of sexy and you also said the word perverted. And I do think there's some like perversity in the work that you do. And I mean that in a positive way because no one addresses that. And it got extreme in the late 2010s where the conservative, like the conservativeism, that's the word, in fashion and like the monk style. And there's just like lack of sex and everything. And I'd say in the last couple of years, and you just had, you just launched this collection with self-portrait. Do you see a change in, because I see more, and a lot of my friends wearing more, I'm wearing more fitted clothes than I've ever worn before. Do you think that there is an acceptance of like recognizing that the body is a thing or do you think it's still separate and that people aren't willing to acknowledge that humans are sexual? Do you know what I think? The industry work is very small and it can be a lot of snobbery there. And especially when you think about sex or clothing relating to sexy clothing, people can be quite snobby, but there's lots of opportunities in that. And meantime, me and my sister, I work very close with my sister, we've always done sex really different to everyone else. And that's why we stood out. But it's bizarre because when I did the self-portrait, it was like literally looking back to that very first collection, which was literally tiny little short dresses with frills and that very American pageant world. And when people saw those dresses, they were repulsed and also they were like in bright neons. And I was like, well, someone's got to do it. Like, everything else has been sort of done. So I want to do something completely different. And that's what being a fashion designer for me is all about. That's the people I watch growing up, like a helmet lying around, Gianni Versace was literally make people set up and walk away with a reaction. So I don't know, like, the industry is always changing, but I think sex will always be relevant. Elegance will always be relevant. Femininity, masculinity, I think today there's room for everything. And I think that's great. How did you and Tammy end up working so closely together? I mean, we're like best friends. Like, we've done everything together. She was at college when I was at high school. So I literally saw her growing up and her inventing herself. And we then moved to London together. I got into St. Martin, she moved down with me. So we always knew it was going to be the duo. And meantime, we were like, after I graduated, it was fast track and we're like, okay, we're starting the business and we better get our heads together. And yeah, it was as fast as that. Literally graduating in a hotel room, ran a winter, then backstage, we don't tell her and working on a tell her and then in a sales room in Paris with buyers knocking the door. I'm like, who the hell's that? My God, don't open the door. So it was really amazing, but it was like, fill on, like we were really thrown in deep. Yeah. Do you think that as the years went on, obviously you matured and you gained more experience, but do you think that the puppeteers of the fashion industry, the ones that still exist, do you think they're more careful with young designers than they were now, than they were when you were coming up? Because it was a sort of like, all of you got investments really quickly. You were pushed to become global brands really quickly. Like you said, you were being critiqued next to Prada and reviews, things like that. Do you think that the industry maybe has pulled back a little bit and the amount of pressure that they put on those new entrants? Do you know what? It's a hard one because I think, I don't know, it's like, I think today when there's all this change in fashion, I mean, change is always good, but for me, when we were starting out, it was, I was very, always just concerned about me and timing what we were doing and having integrity and making sure we could be the most creative. And obviously we had to sell our clothes. We never put razor blades in anything. It was like very wearable and brilliant. And when we first did the crocs, everyone was also repulsed, but we had to do it. We did pull slides as well in 2012, which everyone was like, what the hell's going on here? And I'm like, yeah, pull slides with a cocktail dress. Like, I want to wear that. But young designers now, I think it's really tough, but I do think young designers have a great opportunity to learn more than ever because they have these amazing tech skills with their phone. And, but for me, fundamentally, research and knowing your art history and fashion history is really quite important because being derivative is one of the downfalls of a young designer. And I think for me, I was always, I always shied away for that. And we'd almost rip everything up to start from scratch. But it's a hard one because I think these huge conglomerates, I mean, I think they're really in their own world now. I don't think they really care much. Well, it's not, it's two different businesses. Yeah, it's different business, but we'll always love the underground and we strive for the underground, we strive for the the rebel, the punk. And we hope we need more of that, more of that punk attitude and fashion. Two questions for you. One is what, what did you say, pill what? Oh, we pull, you know, like a pill slide. A pill slide. No, pill, P-O-O. Oh, pull slides. Yeah, pull slides. I thought you meant like a pill box or something. And because I do feel like you have done some, there was like some pill stuff. But oh, yes, I remember those. Oh my god, I remember those. You really did do that stuff first. Yeah, we really wanted, I don't know, like we always look back to our landscape growing up in Scotland and that's what people were wearing. And the working class people looked really good back then. It was just how people dressed. They always wanted to wear the best everything and they worked really hard for it and they kept it really good. And I'm very, very happy to have been brought up in that way because my childhood always influences me in everything.

So Instagram, TikTok, whatever, and I bring this up way too much, but on my Instagram feed, I get tons of, I follow no fan accounts of Carol Imbezette Kennedy, but I get every single day like 45 pictures of her, because I do think she's interesting and we'll look at them. But the point being that all of imagery has been flattened and so they're just constantly, it used to be like Stella Bubbie, who edits the Style section of the New York Times in an interview once she said, when she made a magazine in the late 90s, you would go to the library to research. And so you'd really have to work to pull your references. Whereas now it's just like, how can you do anything original when your brain is just being inundated with other people's imagery? And A, what do you think? And B, how do you manage that? Because you're online, you're not living in a cave. You experience this now too. Do you think it's possible to be as original as you have been? I think it is. I think owning that authentic power and looking backwards already in your brain or people you've met or something that's happened in your childhood or where you've been brought up culturally, I think, like you say, there's all this image, images, but it all starts to look the same. And that's really sad. So when you dig deep, when you do go to a library or you do watch all these old films, you see things that, oh my gosh, this is brilliant. Because in your candy, like, oh, I never saw that before. And that's proper research. And that's what we all had to do back at college. We didn't have AI or JAP, GBT, whatever it's called, or mobile phones. It was literally, we had to see what was happening in the street. We had to go thrifting. We had to dissect clothes. We have to, and I think we should still be doing that today. And I think students need to learn from the bottom up. But of course, they have this luxury of technology. But with technology comes a lot of responsibility. I forget who says that. But yeah, I think you know, you know, who says with great power comes great responsibility. Someone in Spider-Man, I think. That's the star wars. It's something we just drew. Or Yoda. Yeah, it's very true. But yeah, I think fashion is seen as something that's, oh, it's just fashion. It's just clothing. But for me, it was always very cultural and emotional and personal. And that's why I was put there out there. And I think Steve Jobs said it himself. He said, cultural product, things that culture has been the product for it to last a long time. And it's true. It can't just be the same as everyone else. And I think that's what's happening now. There's a lot of the sameness. Yeah. And I don't think people are that stupid that they can keep going with the sameness. I think people do want aspiration. They do want fantasy. They do want something that's going to take them somewhere or make them think differently or dress differently. But yeah, fashion is going through a very strange time at the moment, for sure. Do you think that tides are changing at all? Like there are green shoots of, I think I'm today in line sheet, again, this is going to run a long time, a ways out from now. But I'm going to talk a bit about Galliano leaving Margiela. And I'm not passing judgment on that collection. I think that collection, to be honest, was given a little too much weight because of the fact that there is so little creativity. But I do also really admire the conversation it started. And since then, like when you look at some of the appointments at the big houses, Peter Copping at LaManne, Sarah, Bertna, Givon, she, I'm not again, not passing judgment, these are right. But these are quote unquote real designers. And they're not people who, for a while, it was really about creative product designers getting those jobs. And it feels like it's moving a little bit by, if you look at Peter at a Liao or whatever, or Matu at Chanel. Like what do you, do you think that the executives have woken up a little? Or do you think that they are just riding another trend? Because as you and I both know, the executives are definitely not creative. And they literally just do what they think is going to make the money and what everyone else is doing. They never think outside the box. And I think it's actually a huge issue for the industry. But do you think, do you think the times have changed at all? I really hope so. And I think obviously the recent engage, like people getting these jobs is great. And I think it's going to really inject a lot of energy into the industry. But I don't know, I don't have a job. I've had interviews and I've been told lots of things coming from these people. And that's okay. Like I take it all on board. But for me, being a fashion designer is being fashion designer. It is great. And from the top up, you have to give these amazing ideas like any other industry. It's all about these magical ideas that then filter down into other products or the storytelling and all these things. But it's really interesting. But I do think, I mean, I think people doing a great job. But like you mentioned, Peter, he's doing great things with the codes. Sarah Burton, that'll be really interesting, which is going to do there because I really like Sarah. And obviously, Matus, Pataga, Chanel, so he's done a great job. So it's really interesting. They're really strong designers, I think. And I think they have a voice. But yeah, sometimes someone described me as a Formula One driver driving a Ford Fiesta. And it's true. I should be driving a Formula One car, but I'm not. But that's just how it is. It's just I've made my time and just gone with it. Why do you think you haven't ended up doing one of those big jobs? Do you think it's just timing and then it wasn't the right either they didn't, the executive didn't get it or it just wasn't like the my guess is that someday it will happen. But like, do you think the stars didn't align for you in that in that way? Maybe something like that. Like I really, I try not to think about it too much because obviously, I've just closed my brand a year ago. And obviously, I'm very on the fence whether to start up again, or to maybe go for an established brand. So that's still up in there. But I mean, never say never. Obviously, if the opportunity came up, I would obviously think about it and think about how I could move forward and what I could do for the brand. But fundamentally, I trained for six years at the Best Arts School. I want to be a fashion designer. I don't want to be creating merch. Yeah. And I do think merch is really important, but it has to come from a really good place to begin from. And a really good place of integrity to then get good merch, calling it merch, being I mean stuff. But like your more joy line was awesome. And it was like, And I see joy, I mean, joy is obviously a seasonal thing with Christmas. But even before that, I see it in advertising, the word more and joy in so many advertising, it's literally everywhere. So that's okay. How did you and was Peter Saville, did he design it? No, it was, it was from the joy of sex books. Oh, yeah, yes. Yes. It feels like there is a Peter Saville thing about it. Yeah, I think the same genre the same, the same time. And it was amazing because I've always loved those books. And obviously, they were very forbidden growing up. And you would go to the library and like adult sections, sneak read, you'd be like, Oh my God, someone's going to catch me. But it's the same when I did, I looked at the Johnny Versace books. I used to be like hide in the library and look at them. So, but those, those amazing joy of sex books are great. And the illustrations were just so beautiful that I had to use them and got permission from the artist. And from that, we then went on to do more joy, which was sort of like a branching out from that. Yeah. Well, you mentioned the word authenticity earlier. And I think the word I like to use is genuine. And there was something really genuine about it. It looked cool. But B, it felt really good. It made people feel good. And there is something about your work. And it's funny, the two designers you mentioned is our helmet laying in Versace, which you wouldn't think. But now I see it like thinking of you, which is so interesting because those aren't most designers are not pliable or flexible enough in their brain to be able to look at those two things and process them together. When you look back at those early Versace or the helmet line shows their life giving, they really are. And they really make you have the goosebumps and you literally stare and you want to be that person, that woman, that man, like helmet laying on the shows. Like, I mean, he was putting down like harnesses that were very like Gianni Versace. They were both doing very similar things and techniques, but obviously put in a different setting landscape. Gianni was doing harnesses, so was Helmut. But it was completely different spectrums of sex and sexuality. But that's why I loved it. So it was really, it was very small. Each spring, 23 Pulitzer Prizes are awarded for Distinguished Journalism, Books, Drama, and Music. It was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out it was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th. Follow and listen on Apple podcasts, the Odyssey app, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcast.

What would you do differently if you did it again? And also, you don't have to share like, did you have investors when at different times, I know, caring, obviously, but like... We closed because the invest that we had did pull out. Everyone knows that was fine. So we had to just obviously pull the shutters and obviously recovering from COVID. It was really tough times for everyone. But it's something I had to do. But starting up, I mean, I think they exercise work with self-portrait and this whole concept of contemporary price points. And what Han has done at self-portrait is really correct. He's built an amazing business, great quality clothes at affordable prices. And that's something that 40% of our business back in the day was those affordable price points. So it's not something I'm shy of. It's just, I'm always very, in the back of my head, that storytelling needs to be there, that real, like, to get me going to then get to that point where I can get the 40% because for me, it's all about, I've said it before, this strong identity that sets you apart. This, I'm just looking through this collection right now and I, I mean, it's, it's so incredible. It looks totally like you and like nothing else and is sexy and feels contemporary and also everything is under a thousand bucks, which is amazing. I mean, you can't fault it. It's amazing. And it's very referential for that first season because that's when I felt so free back in 2006. And it was actually just like, oh my God, we're sending down a neon dress. And honestly, Lauren, people were mortified. But I loved that. So I was like, oh my God, you work in fashion, like, really? But it was one of those things where I loved that, really, like that little disrupting the industry back then was like, wow. So yeah, I always look at that collection for that point of view. If you did it again, would you spend, like, would your working process be different? Do you think or no? No, because I love, I've always loved drawing and sketching and researching. And for me, it's like the key to my success is always finding that unknown territory or that unknown reference. So for me, I work, I dream it, live it, breathe it. And I mean, I've maybe changed my technique where I'm always on my iPad. I'm always like drawing sketching my iPad because it's faster. So I'm always, I'm into my Photoshop now. I really love my Photoshop. But yeah, I'm very old in the sense that I'm just catching on to that. But I do love that the fast and the speeds of that tech. Do you do any other type of, like, do you work in any other mediums other than clothing? I mean, I did my first art show in Vienna in 2023, which was like primarily paintings in collage. So I do do that on the side. But I mean, most of the textiles that we've created in the show has been done by myself and Tammy. So we do like our textiles and creating and being very hands on. So, but yeah, like, I think we've learned that from the beginning, having nothing at the beginning of our business, you have to do everything from making the tea to taking the bins out to doing showrooms. And that's, I wouldn't change that for the world. If you could decide tomorrow, either some dream investor, which we know there, there's basically 0.5 of those people. Dream investor came in, or you got a big job at one of the houses that is run responsibly. What would you prefer to do at this point in your life? Like, would you rather be the designer of, I'm not going to say the name, but there's a brand that I really want you to be the creative director of? Or would you rather do your own thing again? Do you know what, I'd love to do both. But obviously at this point in time, I'd really like to focus maybe on another brand, or I'd love to just learn new things. But also, I mean, just working in fashion in general, like start my own brand is also very exciting, because I do think there's, they're missing me and Tammy's influence. Let's be honest. And that's something that we've always brought to the table. But I could do that on other platforms like another brand. So I would always authentically be me with the other brand in mind, because I know too much, Lauren, and that's what one of my, I know too much about fashion and art, and that's one of my strongest points that I can really historically, it's just what I love. It gives, again, gives me oxygen, like research and to work in a brand and to go in the archives. I mean, who wouldn't want to do that? Did this self-portrait partnership, did it light a fire in you somehow? Yeah, I think it was that sense when we did the launch. It was like, everyone was like, Oh, we've really missed you. And it just shows you how much people have missed you. And I was like, this is great. But it was also that thing being back in the studio with people around you and the hustle. And it's just so much fun being in the studio with like-minded people and being around the community. It's just great. It's like an adrenaline buzz. And obviously, when we did that launch, it was great with Karen Warthelter, the campaign, which was Karen has always been a huge supporter of mine. And she wore that collection. And I think Carole Agar felt photographed her in one of the dresses. So Karen was the one person I wanted to wear it because I was like, there's no one there. And Karen, like, she's constantly copied. Women should always be more caring because she's just phenomenal. But yeah, it was amazing. No one better. No one better. But an amazing project and an amazing product. And people love it. Love it. Loved. Yeah. When you look in the next 10, if you look ahead the next 10 years, what do you think? How do you think the fashion industry is going to evolve? You've been in it for 20 at this point longer. What do you think the next 10 are going to look like? I really hope it goes back full circle. And we're actually talking about creative fashion as a creative industry. And it's not just stuff. And it's not just the same stuff. I want designers to look different. I want this competitive. Like, it was always very, when we started, it was like this competitiveness, which was kind of very natural. It was very, healthy for me to be competing against other people. I know that sounds really weird, but it was that thing. It gave me the push to push forward and do other things and be better. But nowadays, I mean, it's not hard to do good stuff because I don't think there's that much good stuff out there. When I did mention those designers, like Peter and Matthew and these people are doing something really good or Shamina Khloe is doing something really great. Or there's the guy at Bali. I think he's going to go. Oh my God, I'm obsessed with him. Simone. He's done a great job. Great clothes. Yeah, I love it too. And so yeah, there's in I think JW is doing a great job at the webby. And so these people have got a real voice. And I think we need to have more voices and more like radical, like being really radical, because fashion is the best time was when it was most radical. Yeah. And not seen as like, I have fab. I think, especially in London, we're always dumbing it down in London. Like people don't really know what a fashion week. And I think that's really sad. But you have other cultures, other cities like Paris or Italy where it's real culture, it's been brought you've been taught at school. Whereas the best talent in the world comes from London, but we're not really seen. So hopefully that spotlight in London again. But yeah, I think to really value your creativity and it's the straight even the question. I think one of your questions said about creativity in fashion, I'm like, I'm perplexed by the question because I thought that was the whole point. And any industry ideas to inspire. I think you're getting to something when you said about Europe. And I think of the UK as being so much more respectful and fashion being a part of life compared to America, where it really is seen as something like a frivolous pursuit. Whereas in France and Italy, it is a part of your life in the same way watching movies or eating or whatever are a part of your life. And that gives it so much more weight. And I also think like I mostly interview executives and for years, like they have their talking points and executives in France, especially use the word creativity so much. And they understand and look, they are becoming more corporate as the world becomes more global and more standardized. And they are basically having AI generated product that we hate and it's disgusting. But they understand that like, if you put in the work creatively, the upside is much you'll make way more money on the end, you have to invest a lot up front, but you'll make more on the end. And so I think you're, you are like, nailing a point that my hope is other people are starting to understand too. Yeah. And it's really sad to say that we're having to catch up to that again, because people like that I respect, like a Mrs Prada, she's never faulted. And she's stuck true to the creative force. And that's why she's here today and who she is or Reka Kupu. These women are really quite at the forefront of creativity and they never have shied away from it. And they're not scared of it. And we shouldn't be because it was the first thing I learned to do was to draw. So what does that say about the human race? We're always very tactile being creative. It's like the biggest, most, the biggest human outlet when it comes to music or like fashion should be seen as the same. It's for me, I get so much joy from it. I get so much joy from you, Christopher. Thank you for being here. Thank you Lauren. Fashion People is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck.
