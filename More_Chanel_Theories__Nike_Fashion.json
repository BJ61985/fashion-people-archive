Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Line Sheet, Puck's private email about the fashion and beauty industries. And today on the show we have Marie Claire, editor-in-chief, Niki Ogunaki. We're talking Niki's relationship with fashion, why big name designers are erasing their Instagram grids, the future of magazines and plenty more. Plus, as always, the rumor of the week. Let's get started. Hi everyone, I am back in LA until Friday. Don't judge me. I'm addicted, I love traveling, but I'm actually going on a little break. I'm headed to Europe with my family. So that'll be very nice. And then I am going to stop by Paris and Milan for some meetings with Puck's co-founder Liz Goff. So I'm excited to see many of you. And I can't wait for you to meet Liz. She's the best. I'm still recovering from last week's Virginie news. There's obviously hopefully going to be some more announcements soon. I don't know about Chanel Creative Director appointment, but we're just waiting on so many changes right now at the executive level at Carrying an LVMH, at the designer level, and even at the PR level. In Monday's Line Sheet, I have some notes about some big PR changes, as well as an executive change at the row. And much more, there is a giant story on the business of Bedford Media, which is Carly Kloss and Josh Kushner's new media group. They currently own ID and they have a deal to publish Life Magazine.dashmeridith owns the IP to Life. My guess is that Bedford will make some more acquisitions for the next year or so, but they really got to get ID and shape. And that's what the story ended up being about more than anything. I sort of offloaded my notes on what's been happening there. And I think there will also be some announcements about ID, maybe even in the coming days. We will see. Today, as mentioned, we have Nikki Ogonaki, who is one of her generation's biggest stars. She's the current editor-in-chief of Marie Claire and a big fan of hers and was excited to catch up with her. So let's get started. Nikki, how are you? I'm great. Thank you so much for having me. Welcome. So first question. You were on a plane. Did you eat breakfast? I am reporting live from the Santa Barbara Airport and I did eat breakfast. I'm actually coming off of a bout of food poisoning, which feels very fashion-y. But I had the greatest gift. Very double-worse product. But I had Cheerios, a banana and some. What are those? Pistachios. This is the first appearance of cereal on fashion people. I had to go for something dry and I was like, let me just have some Cheerios and some oat milk. And it was delicious. Bring back the Cheerios. So did you eat that when you got up this morning or did you eat that on the plane? I ate it in the lounge, actually. My flight was at like 6.15 this morning. So I don't love eating that early, but I had to get something in. Yeah, it's very early. I sometimes I don't eat because I always do a 6 a.m. or at latest like 7 a.m. on the way back to LA. And sometimes I just don't eat because there's no point in eating that early, but it just depends on the day and if I'm so hungry. I don't know how you do these early flights. They're like awful. I'm obsessed with them. I feel like this is a terrible time to be up. If I am an early person, so I'd rather go to bed at like 8.30 and then get up at 3.30, which is still, no, that's like, what's still seven hours. So it's pretty good. I and I can fall asleep. So that's not an issue for me. The problem is like I did it, did one last week and I didn't go to bed till 11.30 because I was packing. So if I can get to bed at 8.30, even 9.30, it's manageable. The reason I like them is because it is very unlikely that they are going to be canceled or delayed because they're the first flight out. And also, unless you are doing a red eye, they are the most efficient. So if I leave at 6 a.m. in LA, I get in at 2. I can still do a couple coffee, a coffee or a drink and have dinner with someone that night. Whereas any other flight is a little too late to do that. If I was flying like the first class every single time, I would just do, I would, I would totally just do a red eye even to, to, from LA to New York. But that's not what's happening. So for me, that's the most efficient. And then on the way back, it does make it hard to stay up past like 7.30. But on Saturday, so I left, I actually, my flight got delayed last Wednesday. And until three, and I was like, Oh no, I'm not doing this. So I got on a different airline flight and got, I got in at four. I was totally fine. I was able to have my dinner that night. And then I, on Saturday morning, I flew back and I did the 7.15 and got in at 10.15. My family picked me up at the airport. We went for, out to luncheon and we were back in our home at 1 p.m. So I was able to. So that's nice. Yeah. But so that's my thinking. But also I hate airports at like 10 o'clock at night. They're too crazy. They are too crazy. I will say my flight this morning was quite crazy. I mean, I got to the airport. I'm the type of person that's like, I do the two hours. I don't do three hours ahead, but I do like two hours. I like my routine. Yeah. To go to the lounge, sit down, whatever I don't like to rush. But I got to the airport a little too early today. So like 4 30 a.m. And it was just like me and like the weirdos at 6 15 flights. Yes. Yes. I mean, I could I could literally talk about airplanes and how to manage that. I mean, you spend half your life on flights these days anyway. So it's so true. So what are you here in LA for? I'm going to see a amplify. They're doing a summit where they grab. They gather like influential people of color across like all of the creative industries to get together for just like programming. And I really wanted to check it out. A, because we, as you know, Marie Claire is getting into or has like our own summit. And so I'm curious about how other brands and organizations do summits. And then specifically for this one, Michelle Obama and Regina King are supposed to be speaking and like I will jump at any opportunity to see the two of them. So have you met Michelle Obama? Have you have you have your cancer? Maybe you're going to get to. I know, I know. Yeah. That's really exciting. Yeah, I'm really excited about it. I like I'm just so interested in in these sorts of opportunities. I'm a huge believer in live events, which is why I continue to want to do them at Marie Claire. And so when I got invited to this one, I was like, yeah, I'll totally come out. Did you buy anything new for this event? No, I didn't actually, you know, I'm really trying to break myself of buying new things for events. I really believe in just being ready. So like I, you know, I went to that product sample sale and I did some damage there and somewhere in some shirt from there. But I don't like manic frantic shopping for events. I like to just be ready. I think that's my corn side. I think in your, in your newsletter that you publish ever Saturday through Marie Claire, you, you're sort of shopping habits and how you manage your wardrobe is very evident. And I would say you are a very, you know what you like. I mean, that's why you're a good editor in chief. You know how to make a decision. You know what you like. And you're very specific about what you want. And I can tell you have sort of guardrails that you keep yourself in to make your life easier. And that is a good lesson for people. I think in your job in particular, people are probably always asking you, what should I wear? How should I wear it? And you are able to give really good advice about how to build a wardrobe around your personal style, that sort of thing. Yeah. And build a wardrobe that actually like, you know, supports your style in your day to day. I think a lot of people are like, just for the job you want or just for the life you want, but it's like, you actually need to dress for the job that your life or whatever that you're living right now. So yes, I would love to be able to wear heels and be like the best dressed person at the airport, but like I'm running, like I'm constantly going from place to place. So like that's just not how that's just not the vibe. And so it is interesting when people ask me for fashion advice, because I'm like my, my personal, my, the way I dress is so specific to me and to my day to day that I can't be prescriptive in it, but I do like to give, you know, my opinions, I have them. You do. So we have a jam packed schedule today as usual. And it's funny because there is actually, there's so much going on, but it's very concentrated within these particular companies. And the first thing I wanted to talk to you about was something that you were a part of, which was this Nike race in Greece. And can you tell us a little bit about what you were doing there, what the race was, how you got involved in this Nike program? Yeah. So I am coming off of a 41 person relay race in Greece. We ran from Mount Helicon to the base of Mount Helicon, to the base of Mount Olympus, to celebrate the Pegasus 41, which is Nike's new running shoe, an issue that I've run in forever. And they gathered like 41 people from around the world. It's funny when I landed, I figured that there would be more media there, but it was really a lot more like run crew people from like Amsterdam and from Paris and like literally all over the world. And so I sort of, I mean, I think I was like one of two maybe media people there. I was the only media person there from North America. I feel like I occupy this interesting space when it comes to Nike and when it comes to brands in general, because I do have this following on social media. I do have this podcast. I have this newsletter, but I'm also that editor-in-chief of Marie Claire. And so when I get invited on these things, it is sort of a, you know, a one stop shop for, for all things. But I really only try to work with, you know, if it's going to be me personally, I really only try to work with brands that I believe in and that really speak to like what I do. As you know, I'm a runner. I feel like you and I bonded a little bit over, have bonded over running. And so, yeah, we were just there in celebration of this, the shoe brand. And like, I'll probably write about it for my newsletter. I would have, I've written about running in my newsletter before. And I love the shoe. I think it's, it's really great. And I think it's good for the average runner. So when I think about whether I'm going to cover events or not like this, it has to like really fit into what I would be doing anyway, you know? Yeah. What I find very interesting about Nike's, I don't even, I mean, there are so many different departments and organizations within that organization. I have no idea how they even characterize this, but they're sort of running influencer events that it's, it's less about, I don't think they're like e, they're begging people for coverage. I actually ran, and maybe you ran this as well. It was this third, I want to say 13K in Toronto, probably like 10 years ago. Oh my gosh, they did run that. Yeah. Yeah. And Claire Mazer ran it. And I did not. And I remember Claire was separate from, she was like in the influencer group, not the editor group because, because she ran her own business or whatever, even though there are sort of editors, but whatever. Anyway, I ran it as a pedestrian. I did not, I, I didn't go out with them. I think I met up, I said hi to everybody in the tent afterwards. But I was blown away by, I was used, you're used to like, even I don't go on press trips or whatever. I'm used to getting like a little bit of better service or, or a little bit more attention if people know how I am, even if I'm like, no, no, no, no, no. Of course you're going to get pampered a bit. And in this case, I wasn't, they really didn't know I used my married name. And I was just blown away by the overall experience of this event. Everybody, when we left, it's interesting. Everyone got a Tiffany necklace for, for instead of a metal. Yeah. And I was just like, this felt awesome as just a regular person. And, you know, Nike and Adidas and these companies are, are really challenged right now, but I think hearing seeing that event on your social media and I didn't know as a relay race, I just knew that you were with all these great people and you were all running together and you got to go to this amazing, amazing location. It's that kind of stuff is very smart. And I'm always interested in how brands engage with people of influence. Like you said, you have all these different platforms. You're not an influencer. You're not just an editor. You're not what just a podcaster. So it's, it's smart of them to like form a relationship with you because it's it will pay off more than, than I think people realize. Yeah. And I've been working with them for the last like 10 years, literally. And so to be able to continue this relationship has just been like super fun and rewarding. And I'm surprised, frankly, that more brands do not try and do a similar thing. Like I'm very interested. I'm like, have my eyes completely on, on right now, because it's so clear that they're investing a ton of money and stuff. Like, you know, they just like named Zendaya and Roger Federer as ambassadors. And I'm like, is Zendaya going to do a run, you know, run experience? Like, are they going to do races? Are they going to get people bibs for, you know, New York marathon, like those sorts of things? I'm really interested to see what sort of space specifically wrong, like specifically on is going to try to capture because they do have this sort of like fashion-y side to them. Frankly, if I were them, I would start a fashion run club. And totally choose to everyone. And we would meet up like once a month and do, you know, three mile run. Joe Holder would be the, the person who would be the sort of like run coach. And like, you're welcome on. I just came up with your strategy. Yeah. If you do that on, you better give Nikki a commission and not just invite her. Exactly. So I actually just bought some on running gear and I returned it. You returned it? Yeah, it just was, I got a pair of shorts and a sports bra and I was like, I don't need these. I did get the Louis Vuitton T-shirt in pink. So that I kept that. You're going to work out in it? Are you going to? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's active wear. I mean, I only wear my rules are navy, gray, white and red for and black. Navy, gray, white and black for workout clothes and occasionally red. And I decided pink was okay too. But yeah, I'm going to work out on it. I work out on clothes that I've had for 10 years. So I figure if I'm going to use it for that long, it was worth the cash. But the bra, the sports bra on the shorts, they were fine. It just wasn't. I was just like, it's I, I bought too much stuff. I don't need them. I have nice running shorts from Lululemon. I don't need anything right now. But but yeah, it's definitely one to watch. The process of accepting insurance outside of a group practice can be tough.

Something else that I'm watching right now in yesterday's line sheet, I had this big story on Bedford Media, which is the venture owned by Carly Claus and her husband, Josh Kushner. They acquired ID Magazine late last year and they also earlier this year did this deal to publish Life Magazine, which hasn't officially been published since 2000 and they did the deal with Dot Dash Meredith, which still owns it. We'll see how it all. I don't think they're going to have anything with Life until 2025. But the piece is sort of kind of spilling out my notebook of observations over the last couple months. I think they're going to have a bigger announcement soon. But I was just curious from your perspective, you've worked at traditional legacy media for much of your career. You have now gone to a traditional legacy title Marie Claire, but that is owned by Future Publishing, which has been around forever, is based in the UK. But their foray into lifestyle and women's interest publications is actually pretty new. They acquired Who What Where and a few other brands a few years ago. They acquired Wallpaper. Our friend Hilary Kerr is running everything and you report to her. So you're working with Hilary a lot. But I'm curious, you are now working in this area of, sure this is technically a legacy publisher, but they really work in a new kind of start-up-y way. And what's it been like for you transitioning not only into an editor in chief role, but into a role at a publication that has to rethink itself to serve an audience that has TikTok to look up advice and all of that. Yeah. I mean, it's wild. Like in August, August this year will be one full year that I've been there. And I have to say that it was a steep learning curve, but I've also never felt this confident in a role. Like I feel very, very prepared to take on this role because it has a little bit of digital. It has a little bit of print. It has a little bit of live events. And I've always really loved the ability to do a little bit of everything. I think that's what a modern brand should be doing. And so I have to stop myself when I say that I work at Marie Claire magazine. I don't work just at the magazine. Like we do print twice a year and that's amazing. But we also do power play or live events series. And we have nice talk, my podcast, and I have my newsletter and we have the website and we're going to keep growing and evolving. And I think that's what you have to do as a modern brand. And so when I, you know, you see something like Bedford media, like, yeah, that is incredible. That is the sort of thing when we talk about like a word, I hate disruption. Like that is going to be a disruptor. Like, or if I were a part of it, I would make sure that it was a disruptor. Like I wouldn't just do magazines. I wouldn't just do print. I would, you know, figure out how we could write stories and license them for Netflix. I would figure out like what our TV or movie arm would look like, like all of that stuff that we've seen a condo and aster or a hearse, like kind of do. Like we can learn from where these brands or these sort of conglomerates have have failed and do better. And so that's sort of my mission when I am talking to Hillary and when we're thinking about what women's media even looks like moving into this next like generation for Gen Z and Gen Alpha and how we're going to be speaking to them. And frankly, how we're going to be speaking to millennial women as well, because MC's woman is like firmly a millennial. Just we're just considering all of the ways that we're going to be able to reach her and also the ways that like we don't necessarily need to reach her the platforms we don't necessarily need to reach her on. Yeah, it's interesting. I just did an interview with this subset called the spread and one thing that yeah, it's interesting. A couple of weeks ago. Yeah, they mentioned that. I think one thing they talk about is like redefining women's media and I think I don't even know if you can use that term anymore. Like it feels and they did a little data right? Like is it women's? I don't know. I struggle with it sometimes because I'm like, yes, we speak to women, but we also speak to people. And so is it just media? Is it okay to have a space where we say like this is, you know, for women? I don't know. We, I don't know. There's no, I think one way to do media these days and like honestly, you just have to tell good stories. And so when I look at people who are doing it, well, that's like kind of what it just comes down to. Like they're just telling good stories and it could be for, for anywhere. I think that if you, you know, when you speak to people, you speak to like real media heads, people who have been obsessed with this forever. They're like, I've loved GQ forever. I've loved Esquire forever. And it's like, you know, the same women who grew up reading like sassy and YM and teen people like we, you know, essence, like we've loved all of these magazines, all of these brands forever. And so it's hard to say that like we're doing just women's media, even though I know that my audience is mostly women. Totally. And for, for ID and bed for, I think the real question now is the intention is definitely good. It's the right intention. They, they know these brands are important brands and that they are things that people want to engage with. Whether or not they are going to execute, that is another question. And unfortunately for them, I mean, for better and worse, they are famous. And so people are really watching what they're doing very closely and they haven't executed on anything or nothing has come to fruition yet. So my story is sort of like everybody wants us to work guys, but you gotta, you gotta, please save media. I mean, the thing is, this is how media has worked forever. Like wealthy people have run own these businesses, not always run them, but own these businesses and stewarded them. And hopefully it works. And we're all rooting for ID to work. I think that's, that's the big takeaway from my piece. It's not going to be a smooth ride along the way, but we'll see what they do. It's, it's fun. It's fun. And I think for people like you who you sort of started just as everything was began beginning to fall apart. It's an exciting time to like come into a leadership role and say, hey, I understand what made that stuff really good way back when, but let's modernize and put it in a framework that works for, for now and the future. I wanted to ask you about what you are great on social media. What do you think about this new strategy quote unquote of these big designers erasing their grids? So John Galliano erased his grid the other day, like a week before the John Galliano creative director of Margiela, former creative director of Dior and his own brand. There's all these rumors. He might be going back to LVMH, which owns his own brand and also Dior. And maybe he's going to Givenchy. Maybe he's going to, to his own brand. And then Kim Jones, who is the current creative director of Dior men, which is yes, it's called Dior men. It used to be Dior home and they changed it to Dior men for whatever reason. Anyway, they, they, he's also the creative director of women's Fendi ready to wear and Couture. And he also erased his grid and everybody was like, what's going on? What's going on? I mean, there could be nothing going on, but I'm curious from a social media strategy, when brands do this a lot too, like they have a new creative director and they just wipe the whole thing. What do you think about this? Like, do you think that it, other than getting people to pay attention to your account for a few days, what do you think the strategy is behind these moves? I find it to be so self serving. I really think it's just for the brand, just for the creative director. As you said, I think it gets people to look at it for like two minutes, but what are you trying to tell me in wiping your Instagram clean? Like it's a clean start. Okay. Like I get it. That's, that's pretty on the nose, but like what else are you telling me? I would prefer, frankly, to see an evolution. I like, and it's the same when I see like my friends or whomever delete their entire Instagram and start all over again. I'm like, what are you hiding? What are you afraid of? You don't want the bodies? Like it's fine. Like, who cares? It's Instagram and social media. Like we're sort of taking the fun out of what I think these platforms are for. Like nothing has to be permanent. Sure. But why delete everything? Like there's a history. These places have legacies. Like why not show that off as well? For sure. I think that is the key here. And what many people don't realize about life is that starting something new doesn't mean you can totally erase the past and you have to take the best of the past and use it for the future. And it's like, if I had started at Marie Claire and I deleted our entire Instagram, like, could you imagine? No, I mean, that, that would be, it would be so crazy. But that's what would be funny. That's what's happening. Like what if I had walked into Marie Claire and was like, start all over again? Like that's wild. It is truly wild. So we will be back with the rumor of the week. Each spring, 23 Pulitzer Prizes are awarded for Distinguished Journalism, Books, Drama and Music. It was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out it was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th. Follow and listen on Apple Podcasts, the Odyssey app, Spotify or wherever you get your podcast.

Nikki, the rumor of the week this week is half rumor, half, we already know what's happening, but it of course is the Virginia VR, Chanel exit. What actually happened? I have a bunch of reporting in Line Sheet about what I've heard happen behind the scenes. So we don't have to go there now. You can always subscribe to Line Sheet. It's very affordable and fashion people listeners get a discount with Puck.News slash fashion people, please go there. But you know, regardless of what actually happened, she was fired or she was, she decided to leave or whatever, whatever, whatever. I would say that the bigger thing is who is going to replace her. And what I've heard from people internally at Chanel, these are people who are senior, but like, they didn't all know that she was getting whatever was happening, was happening. So they're senior, but like not, it's not Lena there, the she's not saying this, but the big thing is what they're saying is like, well, maybe we're not getting a creative director. Like maybe we're just going to get someone who's a bit of an unknown. The Chanel brand is what is important. And that's definitely true. So there is a luxury consumer who is very, very, very educated and goes into the store and knows more than the people who work there and knows every little thing. That's the enthusiast. And then there is also the commodities luxury consumer who doesn't know anything. They think Christian Dior is alive. They think Coco Chanel is alive and does, I think Virginie should prove that, that Chanel doesn't need a superstar creative director to succeed. They don't even need a creative director who the internet likes. So maybe it isn't, but there are obviously tons of names. I've heard so many things about Hedy Slumman and him actually being there already that that's really what's happening. He's definitely leaving Celine, but I'm curious to hear from you. If you could, and this is just speculation. This is nothing to do with what's actually happening. If you could put someone in there, who would be your dream person? Tom Brown would be my dream person. Now, duh, that's never, ever, ever going to happen. However, I do think that he would be incredible there. And I think that he could easily carry on the legacy of the house in the sense like you've been to his shows in Paris. They are fantastical and they're amazing and they make you think and they make you laugh. And, you know, obviously he's masterful at Tweed and he's masterful at suiting. It's never going to happen. But I was surprised that more people, even for the fun of it, were like Tom Brown, Tom Brown, like, my second choice would be Mark Jacobs. I'm dying to see Mark Jacobs back at a French house. I am so sad and gutted that I was not around to be able to go to his LV shows. I think he's incredible and I'm so happy to see his like come back into his own. I think it's been like incredible to watch. But yeah, I think it'll probably be Hedy and, you know, I don't know. I have come around to Hedy's Celine, just in time for him to go, I guess. But I eventually came around to it. And so I, if he did go to Chanel, I think I would welcome him with more open arms than I did, you know, when he went to Celine. Yeah, I would say I actually had a little item in Monday's line sheet about Tom Brown, because I didn't mention him in the first round of who would be a good replacement. And it's true. He can doubt he could definitely do it. And there really isn't honestly, I don't think anyone other than Hedy and Mark that are capable. I think Hedy, Mark, Tom Brown are the only ones that have they have the right idea. And Hedy's idea is different. And no women. Like, I think it's interesting that none, like none of us, myself included are like, here's a woman who should be taking this house. No. Yes. I love Phoebe Philo. Maybe she's the Coco Chanel of her generation, but she doesn't need Celine. I mean, she doesn't need Chanel. She, she's, she's too interesting on her own. And Celine was a great brand for her because it had house codes, but they were very muted. And so she could interpret them in the way she wanted the way Hedy Salman has also interpreted them in the way he wanted to. But he is just like such a great product designer. And I agree. I think who is my dream? I personally think as sort of a business journalist and also as someone who, who as a fan too, I just think Hedy is my number one. But Mark is obviously huge reason I became a fashion journalist. Like I idolized him growing up and think he's so creative and smart, doing an amazing job. And freeing. He's fun. The thing is that like, what is missing from a lot of fashion these days is fun. Joy. I agree. Like where is the joy? Right. Yes. And Mark has joy. He winks at us. He makes fun of us. Like when he pulled out of his show that was four seconds long in his like Maybach or whatever and like drove back to his house. That was funny. Like more joy. Right. And so Mark would be great. And he would bring that element of like, wow, this is hysterical. Like what are we going to see today? That that element that Carl had, you know, 100% it's such a great point. And I, unfortunately, I wasn't in town for his four second show, which I was very sad. So funny. And like no one was pissed. Everyone was just like, Oh, jokes on us. That's hysterical. But I did get to go to a lot of the Louis Vuitton shows. I got to go to the last show. I got to go to the Barbie hair show, which I did my hair for my wedding like that. So I started going to them in like 2010, 2011. I went to many of them. And I feel so, they were huge shows. I love a ton shows are just big, but they were massive shows and I feel so lucky. There are two invites that I've saved. I saved the Alexander McQueen Plato's Atlantis because it was my first fashion week and it was his final show. So I have that invite and I have the note that Mark Jacobs wrote to Bernard Arnaud. I free it just says like, thank you or something, but I saved that from his, from his final show at Vuitton. So yeah, I agree. And I think Tom Brown is he definitely what I wrote was that he has the discipline and you're right that he has the imagination. And he also has the commercial sensibility. Also, I think he'd be less of a pain in the butt than heady will. Heady will want control over everything. And that's why he's good at what he does. But I think Tom Brown would be someone who would be able to sort of fit into the private privately held world of Chanel pretty easily. So we'll see. I don't know. We'll find out. Well, if it's Heady, I think in the next couple of months and maybe, you know, if it's, and you know, do you remember there was that whole rumor that he was basically set up to do it, but they were going to wait a long time? Yes, I do. So it's funny that it's coming back, but I, which I don't, I don't know in what world that would exist. But essentially, I don't know if that makes sense to the audience, but the rumor was that when Carl passed, there was like a basically an agreement that Heady would take over at some point, but not for five or 10 years or would have you. So that would be the timing. The timing would be right. So who know, that's very conspiracy theory, but, but like doesn't seem so far off, right? No, no, especially this family can do whatever they want. They made, I think they made $12 billion off of Chanel over the last three years. So great for them. Congratulations. Say what you want about Virginia. Like the product sold. Like, I agree. But everyone's clamoring after those ballet flats, those tweed jackets, like her, whether her runway product sold is up for debate. I've heard from internally that it didn't, but it doesn't matter because who's right. But who's runway product sell some, some do. I mean, Heddy's, for instance, like I, which you're, you're completely right. I do think it bothered the executives that people didn't like it because the interesting thing about Chanel is they do care about consumer perception in a way that a lot of other brands don't because, and they don't have to. Like they really, obviously they're making billions. They don't have to care what the internet is saying as long as there are people buying what, what they sell. And years ago, they used to, they never published their financial information. They didn't have to their private company, but they had a Swiss entity that they had to file to publicly each year. So like I would pull it out. The Bloomberg people would pull it out and we dissect this information with the disclosure that like. This is what they are sharing. Who knows if there's another entity combined. And so eventually, because we were all writing about this public information that wasn't, it wasn't clear, like how much of the business it actually accounted for. They decided to start publishing it on their own every year because they knew that like the business press trickles down to the consumer press trickles down to Twitter and now TikTok and that stuff is so direct now that Tiktokers would be like, you know, the Tiktokers would just go on the Swiss registrar and get it themselves. So, so they do care. But I think, I think you're right. And that come and also my whole thing is even if they did fire her, something went wrong because she also, I know from people talking there, she wasn't super happy with the situation. So whatever happened, I think it's best for everybody. But also that you're right. And it doesn't have to be a superstar who can take it to the next phase. It's really the decision of the family and what they want to do with it for the next 10 years because every 10 years they're going to have to reckon with this. It's not going to be like a Karl Lagerfeld thing where you're designing something for 40 years. He was the first superstar designer to take over a heritage brand and that playbook, they created it. But now everything is different for how long? Like 30 years? 30 years. That's a long time. I agree. Like, I don't know. We listen, we don't know what happened in the end, but we do know that she was there for 30 years. So maybe she was just like, I don't want to do this anymore. 30 years. I think even if that's only part of it, it was part of it. And we wish her the best of luck. Of course. Thanks to her for making coolots. I thought they looked good. Ballet flats come back again for making Eddie Janes. I agree. Come back again. Love that. Nikki, what are you going to do for the rest of your trip? You're going to the CAA conference thing event. Yeah. Are you going to go to the beach or anything? No, I'm coming right back to New York because I have to go to Paris. We're having dinner next week. Oh yeah, I can't wait. Exactly. With Fromedome. Exactly. He set it up. We're going to Pierre Tuittu's new restaurant, the Saint-O-Jean-Tuitu. Got a calendar invite from him, which is like the weight of my heart. I'm so happy. I can't wait to see you all. You know when, when Hillary was thinking about who to hire and I told, I told Dan, my husband, you know, Hillary needs to hire someone from Marie Claire and, and he said, oh, she's going to hire Nikki, right? I didn't know that. Oh my gosh. Oh, that's so sweet. I had no clue. Yeah. I mean, you're, you're, he was like, she's a star. Oh, thank you. I appreciate that. This was great. Have an amazing event. I hope you get to shake hands with Michelle Obama. Tell her, said hi. And, and I'll see you next week. I can't wait to hear how it all goes. I know. I'll see you next week. Talk soon. All right. Bye.
