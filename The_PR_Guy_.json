A rare time when I am recording this also on Friday, very, very early in the morning. It's been a busy week here in Milan where I've done Wednesday night from London and I hit the ground running on Thursday morning. Did Max Mara, Prada, Poria Omani, MM6. Very interesting. All the MM6 models were sort of looking even the eye, but they had glasses on. So not too much eye contact. I went to a Kate dinner at the Portrait Milano with the store Antonia. I met with friends. I'd say that Prada is always the defining moment and today was no different backstage. Meet your Prada. Graf Simmons talked about making real clothes for real life. They didn't want it to feel too conceptual. And I would say that it did feel the collection felt very much like what people wear during the day. Just, you know, their version of that. So as always, the clothes did make you think. They might not have been as conceptual or too conceptual, but they did make you think. I'd say that watching the show at first, it left me a little cold. But that's the thing about a Prada show. You just can't stop thinking about it. And the more you think about it, usually the more you like it. And even if you don't like it, you still can't stop thinking about it. I actually did end up really, really liking it. And sure, I'll buy one or two things because that's the point of this. That's what fashion is. Wanting things. The big topics this week, though, were Luke and Lucy Meyer, a lot of musical chair stuff. Luke and Lucy Meyer, leaving Jill Sander was their last show. Also sounds like the new Gucci designer is going to be announced sooner than later. Also, everyone loved Sylvia Venturini Fendi's Women's Wear at the 100th anniversary show on Wednesday. There's a Sylvia rally. They need a women's wear designer. She only designs men's. Everyone thought she was in a retire after the 100th anniversary. Now everybody wants her to have both. We'll see. I mean, she's she's like in her mid sixties. A lot of designers work till they're in their nineties. So it's possible. This week on Line Sheet, you'll find more Milan Intel, more sex, global Intel, more LVMH Intel, plus a really fab story from Rachel Sturgats about how Carolina Rear's fragrance, Good Girl, became the number one fragrance franchise in the world beating Chanel. Yes, it's crazy, but it's possible. Rachel has the details. I am here in Milan for a couple more days for some more shows. There's Versace. There's Bali. We're so excited about Bali. Then there's a Bottega party with Patty Smith. Then there's more Armani on Sunday and Dolce. And it will be fun. And then I'm off to Paris on Monday. So more to come. Let's get started with Lucien. Lucien Pajas, welcome to Fashion People. Thank you, Lorraine. I'm super happy to do this with you and very honored. I'm very honored that you said, yes, you know that I think many PR people are going to be jealous that you were the first major PR person on Fashion People. But I just want to tell them there was a news peg so they can all be on some day as well. Of course, of course. And I'm super, I feel super privileged to be the first one. And thank you for this opportunity. I'm very excited to chat with you about what you had for breakfast this morning. What I had for breakfast this morning. Yes, tell me. A latte from Starbucks. What? Just a big latte, a venti latte is from Starbucks. I don't take breakfast. Doesn't sound very French to me. I guess no. It's just because I had a meeting very early on. So I just ordered a latte and I left my house with it, you know, like it was convenient. So there's a Starbucks near you. Not to reveal your location, but there is. Actually, there is a Starbucks in front of my house and there is Starbucks downstairs. The office. So I have two possibilities. Wow. Yeah. There is more and more in Paris. What do you think about that? I mean, you obviously are a patron, but do you, does it bother you that they're around? Or do you? No, because you know, I'm not a very like a European person when it's come to coffee. A very American taste. I love long filtered coffee. I love like I'm not like someone that love Restretto or double express. So like I really have a very American taste for coffee. Okay. I'm glad that you're well hydrated. I guess it's later in the afternoon, your time. So how did you, you say you don't have very European taste for coffee. Where did you grow up and what was your European childhood like? Um, I grew up in the, in South of France, in the mountain, in a very remote space. Um, uh, it's in the place of an area called less event where there is a national park. So it's very like green and there is mountain, there is rivers. It's very like wild. It looked like big Corsica, but it's there is not the sea. It's really like in the mountain and it's nearby Montpellier or Nîmes. So not next, when you say to pay to foreigners, oh, I grew up in South of France, they always think that it's like, uh, Saint-Tropez or Nise or Pierre-Ettes or Marseille, maybe, but me, it's really like not, not very known, except that recently Timothée Chalamet spoke about less event in a, in an interview. So I was really proud. I don't know how it, you know, because it's our French, I think. So that's why maybe it knows this place, but nobody, nobody. Court less event. What, what was it like? What kind of visit mountains is it? It's not beach. No, no, it's really mountainous. Like, uh, there is a, it's very remote. Like there is nothing like it's small village where there is one. I was raised in a village where there was 400 citizen, you know, and most of them live, around the village, even not in the village. They have like, it's, it's, um, it's a place for former, like people from the sixties that decided to live remotely, you know, um, uh, a bit EP style. And they came to, they, they came to this place to do, uh, goat cheese or, uh, honey or raised donkey. It's really like, uh, the mood. I get it. So it's like upstate New York. Yeah, a bit. So how, how did you develop an interest in fashion living there? Is it just so deeply embedded in French culture? No, I don't think, I think I was like, I, I always wanted to work in fashion and I don't know why, because my parents were not connected to the fashion at all. My mom was not interested into fashion. Like it's not that I, you know, like sometimes you have people who tell you, oh, my mom loved to love fashion and that, that was not the case. My parents were really hard worker. They were working in a, they were having their own restaurant and hotel that belonged to my grandparents before. So we were more into the, to the, to hospitality and the gastronomy field. And it's funny because one day I took a plane with someone that I didn't know. And she was sitting next to me and we were discussing about our life and she told, and I told her about my childhood into a restaurant and then working into fashion. And she said, oh, that's the two most exciting or biggest thing for friends. It's funny that you had those both things in your life. And I never noticed that in fact, but it's, so it's make my story very French in that way that I was born and raised in a restaurant, in a hotel. My father was a chef, was a sommelier. And then I wanted to work in fashion. So I had this kind of a duality of like French lifestyle and taste about what French has to offer for the best. But there was no really like it's came to my mind, like really like spun organically, like I was obsessed with fashion. I was like buying magazine in my village and because there was like they were selling magazine like Madame Figaro, Elle or Vogue, or and I was buying them and I was seeing like the fashion show on TV because you know, it's France. Tim Blanks at all. Or did he not get over to France? Not yet. Not yet. But I was also, you know, it's as it's France. The fashion show were on TV on the news, you know, but not full, but like five minutes at the end of the show of the of the of the news. Every day during fashion week, they were showing you the collection from Paris. So there was like Chanel and Saint Laurent and Joe and only the big name, of course, because he has to speak to the to the to the broader audience. And I was dreaming about living in Paris. And and and touching that world and well, but it's also we have to consider that I I born in 1975. So when I started to love fashion was more the 80s and of the 80s. And and there was no like internet. There was no application. There was no Instagram. There was no social media. So our two sources of information were TV and magazine. Very old school. Do you feel like you're very I'm not smack dab. You're kind of at the end of Gen X, actually, but growing up and being interested in those brands and. Seeing what was coming in culture wise from the US and at that time and the UK was I feel like in the 90s, like Anglophilia was really big and even in the fashion industry as well. Did you have a sense of this idea of selling out and like as as a part of that generation and having to be on the edge in some in some way? Or did you not think about it like that? But in fact, everything changed when because I came to Paris in 1993. So to study at the Champs-Elysees de la haute couture. And so I discovered the world a bit, you know, and I discovered also MTV and I don't know if it was already MTV, but, you know, or later on, like there was there was a lot of information. You know, the fashion is is an open door to the world, you know, because when you study fashion, of course, you go in nightclub or you go to see the movie or, you know, so the culture of the 90s is very present in my life because it's where I discovered the world. So all those 90s movie from Gersvencent or this music from the from MTV, they are really, really present in my culture, of course, because it was the it was what we it was what going on. And we were we were young, you know, so I was 18. So we that the the world was really opening and we were having access to many more information. I remember when I was a teenager in the 90s, hearing about people in Europe being obsessed with Levi's. Yes. Was this was this a thing like because you couldn't get them as as easily back then or something? Or is or is this was this like a weird thing that I was hearing in the suburbs of America that was total bullshit? No, we were obsessed with Levi's, but we have access to Levi's. Like it was. I just remember like thinking people were like smuggling. Maybe it was only to Russia, but like I also remember specifically thinking of like cool young French people wearing Levi's. I went to Paris for the first time, I think in 1996 and just thinking that they were like really into Levi's and Converse and things like that. No, we were obsessed with America. You know, we were totally obsessed with the American style, America, way of life. I remember the first things I bought when I done my internship at Saint-Laurent. I worked with Monsieur Saint-Laurent at Saint-Laurent internship and they were really like a social company, you know, they were doing for the intern. They were doing you like a real salary low, of course, but yeah, yeah. My first fished, I don't know, like file of salary. Like it was from Saint-Laurent and I went to high Florent to buy the American flag sweater in in in dark green. That was the first things I bought with my own money. So it says a lot about like it was a 90, 94, something like that. And and and there was we know we were kind of obsessed. Also everything, the pop culture, everything was coming from like US or London, you know, the pop culture is not French. So of course, when you are young, you are into pop culture. So well, now it is with the Bureau de l'Agent. Yeah, that's good. I love you know, I interviewed Virginia Montel. Do you know her? And no, not personally. Is she and she was telling me because she did Amelia Perez and she was telling me about like she worked with the guys, the the the star of Libre Libre de l'Agent and has been is Matthew Cassavitz. Yes, Matthew Cassavitz and is also a filmmaker. And she was telling me how they all she like is the costume designer for all these young or or used to be young and now like in in their prime filmmakers. But I kept calling it Libre and every time I would, she would say de l'Agent at the end to correct me. It was it was very funny. But anyway, so that's really interesting that it was cool to like America at that time. In absolutely. No, but also it was like Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince. I mean, we were like people were dressing like Madonna or, you know, like. You know, I still have on me like a bracelet, like, you know, this bracelet that in cauchu and it's Maripole that we're doing them for Madonna. Yes. And, you know, and Madonna has like hundreds of them of this scout, she bracelet and and I wear it because it's remind me that time where we were we were we were so into Madonna that we wanted the same thing of her, even the boys, you know, we had those bracelets. My friend had those brass because super good to have the bracelet. But we did a new Maripole. I discover Maripole late much later after because it was for me, the bracelet of Madonna, you know, and we were wearing that. Yeah. So what was what was what was Eve Saint Laurent like? What was it's amazing that you you worked with him? Was it a very mom and pop operation, like very close? Everyone was very close? No, no, it was really like the odd culture with all its rule and hierarchy. And I was lucky to be allowed to be in the studio, but I was not talking to Mrs. Saint Laurent, you know, there was an invisible barrier like and we were not so many, we were less than 10 in that studio. But I was in turn, the only intern and. And I only spoke about with Mrs. Saint Laurent about the dogs, like that was the only point of entrance for discussion with him from my place. But I did. I didn't really care, you know, because I had nothing to do. Mrs. Saint Laurent was Mrs. Saint Laurent, you know, like why you would care about an intern, you know, like, I mean, everything was at its place. It was the culture really like the old school culture where everyone has a place. And has to stay at his place. And of course, when you say that today, it looked like a bit like a scary, but that was the way it was built, a Kutuhau, with a lot of hierarchy. And it was kind of difficult because Mrs. Saint Laurent was not feeling so well at that time in the nineties, you know, he was going back and forth into a hospital and like that was not his best moment. But it was amazing to see him draping or decide. He was drawing every single model of the collection. Like it was not like there was a studio, but the studio was just there to execute. It wasn't nobody was drawing the old culture. It was with his pencil and doing his favorite pencil on the desk. So it was really amazing. And I was lucky because I was a huge fan of Saint Laurent and I really like try to get there and I succeed to get there to do this. Those internship and I was lucky. But also I knew that I was looking. I was watching the end of an era and that nothing will be the same anymore. Because even the fashion show, even the way everything was done, was very particular. The model in the cabin, like there was model that were living almost at Saint Laurent available for when Mr. Saint Laurent was arriving, was like a bin. And they were going upstairs to do the fitting. But there was a life like there was life in the cabin, life in Saint Laurent, what could you for the client, the life. There was a canteen. Everybody is nostalgic about the canteen. Now it's in the same building, Avenue Marceau, where they keep all the clothes like into those amazing, like you call safe, like with the exact archive, exact temperature and stuff like that. But that was that used to be like a canteen where we were all going. Everybody was mixed. There was Lulu Lafale sometimes like a canteen, you know, with the little tray. And that was kind of funny. It was really the house of the life of a culture house. Do you think he was the greatest fashion designer to ever live in the same way that Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player, even though I guess LeBron James or whoever, I don't follow it as closely as I used to would be. It's probably technically better. But do you think Saint Laurent, when you look at the history of fashion that you know, do you think he was the best ever? In my taste, yes. But after fashion is a question of taste. But I think if we go out of my taste or your taste or the taste, you can think that he gave the the the grander to this name of Grand Couturier. When you think Grand Couturier, you think probably Balenciaga of Saint Laurent, Manoise Chanel, Christian Dior, like it's very limited. But Saint Laurent was the one that really like I think penetrates the the culture because Catherine the Nerve, because so many movies where I don't the costume, because the fact that he was the first one to be to have his exhibition alive. You know, like he done the Met exhibition when he was still quite young. And that was the genius of Pierre Berger, because Pierre Berger saw Monsieur Saint Laurent and he saw that I knew, of course, they were together but or no more together, but they were like very close. He saw that he was declining and also he was like so he decided to create the meet and create a living legend. That was a very like strategic movement from Monsieur Berger to create the legend while if Saint Laurent was still alive and that protected the house. Yeah, it's interesting. You we always talk about Chanel and as a sort of playbook or a map of how companies work today, but in so many ways, the thing that I think is remarkable about Saint Laurent is the contribution over so many decades. There was they did it. I'm sure it was a traveling exhibit, but I saw an exhibit probably 10 years ago at the De Young Museum in San Francisco. And I was just sort of amazed by how much he had done. And yes, there are dresses that we know and and specific silhouettes that we attribute to him. But it was just so many contributions over what four or five decades. And so many of those designers of that generation only worked for, you know, 10 years or 20 years or shorter stints that and and it's more concentrated. But I feel like in some ways what he did is has been diffused because it was so everywhere. But it's an interesting point about Pierre Berger. There's a great little story that Kathy Horne wrote when Pierre Berger died that it's probably only 400 words, maybe less, just about her relationship with him and also how he operated and how that changed the fashion industry so much. That's it's amazing that that was your first job. Yeah, no, no. And and it's it's it's great what you are saying about because about the decades and the he brings so much to fashion from like the the the craziness of the culture, the inspiration of the heart, the inspiration of the from the the the continent from the love for the woman. The the the the men's the the men's wear women's wear like of course the smoking the cap, the picot, blah, blah, blah, blah. Like it's it's like it was real and totally surreal. There was both sides at Saint Laurent. There is an image. There is something that you can wear today totally like Saint Laurent Rivegauch and many women collect those pieces and wear them. And there was the odd culture that was totally inaccessible, but not only about the price about like this idea of the woman, the woman that is like inaccessible somehow. She's too beautiful to to to chic to elegant to like and and I think it's something that Anthony has really well made into his work at Saint Laurent is the grandeur of the of the Saint Laurent woman. She's always like so. I don't know. Elegan, but in a way that like. Nothing can touch her. I don't know. Like she's. Yeah, I also think the thing about French fashion and the way the French approach fashion and dressing is that it is even if you're not super interested in fashion or you're not an enthusiast, it's a part of your life. And and you're supposed to care about the way you look. Like it's so it's not shameful to care about the way you look or in that way or and I think what he has is proposing is like the things I've bought from him are like a black blouse slingbacks because they're it's exactly right. And it's things that like are really elegant. And. He sort of is giving women permission to care about those things, which in this time, you know, especially living in America where prioritizing those types of things is sometimes not not OK, because, you know, everybody's wearing Viori or whatever. But it's it's an interesting thing of how he has like, no, we're never going to go back to dressing up. But I think what he has done is make it feel good to want to dress up and take care of yourself and all of that. Yeah. And and also to assume this this grand femininity, like to be, you know, a son or a woman, when she I always think about that, like when she entered into a restaurant or something or someone else, you notice her, she's special. And that was very much. Yeah. This show is brought to you by Boca. Boca knows that when you take care of your mouth, your whole body benefits. That's why they create elevated oral care that fortifies your teeth. Boca's toothpaste uses a fluoride alternative called nano hydroxy appetite or N. Ha.

Make the switch to Boca for the whole family at Boca.com. So your insights into this, I think, explain how you ended up going into publicity and communications and storytelling. And so you wanted to be a fashion designer. And at some point you moved into comms. How did that transition happen? And when did you realize that you were more interested in that side of the business? So I done all my study as for to become a fashion designer. I know how to draw and how to sue. But of course, of course I forget a bit, but it was my dream to become a fashion designer. And then when, when I done those internship and everything, I think it's show me a way that I won't, maybe I was too impressed. Maybe I don't too big internship. I don't know. But I had the feeling that I will never become the new San Juan. And so I was less interested into design because I didn't want to be like a normal designer sitting in a studio, like, you know, because I came all the way up from the south of France, from my mountain. And I wanted to be in fashion. I wanted to live in Paris, but I wanted to succeed as well. Like I had the kind of ambition in me. And so when I realized that that could be not the best designer in the world, I switched. And so after I just done different experience, I worked for magazine. I worked for Marcus Colli, an artistic director during five years and a half, more into, in the communication, the more into the image making. And then I opened my office 18 years ago. But I never dreamed to be a fashion PR, you know, it was. And it was like, I never think it was a job. I never, because I didn't know, you know, I was seeing PR in my San Juan, what you're at a different house. But I didn't care so much about that job, you know, like it was for me, it was a parallel job that was just serving the machine. You know, I was not like. Impressed. Yeah. Who was your first client and why did you, did you sort of fall into representing someone or did you, at that point when you started your business, where did you think I want to do this and why? No, in fact, it's really like, and it's what I always say about like, to young people, you have to follow the opportunity. You have to leave the door open. Uh, I really was like that. Like, I saw the first time, like, uh, I was like the first person that spoke to me about that job for me was Vincent Darae. He said, Oh, you should be a PR. You could be a great PR. And I was, okay. You know, like I never think about it. Who was he? Vincent Darae is a, he was, he now is a, is a designer. He's an interior designer. He created furniture. He decorated an apartment, but at that time he was a fashion designer. He done Moschino during years and he, then he was named Emmanuel Ungaro after Jean-Baptiste Avalli. And after he opened his interior design company. And he was one of my first clients, by the way. Um, but the first client was Adam Kimmel, the menswear. Love Adam Kimmel. He's so great. Everybody has a good memory. Yeah. I saw him yesterday night. Oh, wow. Yeah. He was in Paris, uh, and we had dinner together. Like it's always good to, to see him and, um, I thought he was so talented and cool and I, I just really liked him a lot. Yeah. And he was really in advance with like the mix of art and fashion, his look book is also, in fact, if you look at his collection, they were, they are so relevant because this, uh, lucky luxury is not so far from what the row is doing right now. You know, if you go into the collection of Adam, you can feel that vibe of like this super cool, uh, lucky luxury, um, the connection to art, to culture, the old stuff. There was something very, uh, in advance. And, uh, so he was my first client and, um, and he wanted to be in Paris. I, he was very smart. So he knew that as an American designer, he needed to be in Paris and not in New York because he needed to open to, to be not too. Tag as New Yorker and not too, uh, uh, I don't know, in the box of, uh, of, uh, New York fashion. Uh, and so he was, he was showing, uh, with the, the support of Colette, for example, that was one of the first person that bought Adam Kimmel. Um, he was showing in Paris, we were, we were renting space only for his market. And then I was inviting few friends to come and then in a nice way, friendly way, and then we decided that we could open an office together where he can have his showroom. I was representing him in Europe and, uh, uh, the rest of the time when he was not there, I was doing my own things, uh, like representing a Vincendaret, Olympia Lothan, and I started like that with Adam and friends around me that were creatives. So there was no really an agenda. Uh, it was, it was a, like that it was, it happened to me. Uh, Vincent Daret opened the, uh, the launch the idea. And then Adam Kimmel came with the, the, the, the project. And then it was launched, you know, it was always like that. I associate you with APC. I think that's the first place I saw you at an APC presentation. And then I remember seeing you, is it possible that you were at Pearl with your friends, like all having drinks or something? This would probably be like 15 years ago. At where? Pearl is the P-E-R-L-E that, that one. Would you have been hanging out there? No, I don't think. What's the, what's the, um, in the Marais on the corner? La Perle. La Perle. Yeah. Would you have been hanging out there? I just remember you were very intimidating. I was like, well, I mean, before I knew you, you were the, you were the PR running around and, and I, you, I was like, this is the cool PR person. Thank you. I never saw myself as intimidating. I was, um, I don't know. No, you're not, but, but, you know, like I was young at the APC presentation, my husband is there asking John Tui Tu why his iPhone doesn't fit in his jeans. And John Tui Tu said to my husband, I'm not a nerd. That's why. That's very Jean. And no, no, it's, but APC is very me in a way. Like, it's normal you associate me, uh, to, because there is a kind of, uh, like, uh, very French things in APC, but also very open to the world. Or, you know, like, um, and this kind of mean, uh, minimal style, like navy blue sweater and jeans is the way I address myself. You know, so there is a natural connection between, uh, APC and me. And, uh, and I always love, uh, what John and Judy done there and, uh, and, um, how they, they elevate everything. Jean was the first one to put like, uh, olive oil in the store and, uh, and, uh, and the, and the music, the disc, you can buy this there and magazine. And like it was always a cultural platform with good clothes. And this is very what I deeply love, you know, like for myself. As you were building out your PR practice, how did you approach it? Especially given that it wasn't, it's sort of, you didn't come up in that world. How did you build it out in terms of who you hired and your approach to comms and storytelling and, and strategy? What was it? What was sort of your intention? Hello. I, as I was, when I started, I even didn't have like any list of press. I was at my friend in press, you know, like because I was living in Paris and I have friends in press as I had friends in, uh, I don't know, was a field, but, um, I didn't have any list. I didn't have any trick. I didn't have any. So I think it's what's, what really helped me is that I was totally novice, new in that business and I just done it with my, my natural instinct and my brain. So when I was, I was like, because I didn't have the connection, I was thinking I can convince people with my, uh, my, my brain, like, uh, when something is good, you tell to people it's good. I explain why I remember when I introduced Sakai for the first time to people. I was not that, that big PR when I got Sakai, I started to work with her in 2009 and nobody knew Sakai outside of Japan at that time, even though she had a good strong business she was selling in Bergdorf in Barney's and everything, but she was not like known. The awareness of the name was not raised. So I remember when I introduced Sakai to the people, I remember that I used my, my brain. I was thinking, what if I was a journalist, what should I say about Sakai to give me the desire to come to see this presentation? Because at the beginning I was really in the need of just making people come to discover the work. I knew when they discovered Sakai, they will love it. I was convinced. But my narrative was really like based on, uh, if I was this journalist, what I would want to hear to be excited to come. And I always use that thing. Like I wanted to, to, to compensate my lack of connection with, uh, a convincing part of saying interesting thing about the brand. So it's kind of basic what I'm saying, but it was really useful because I never lied to people. I never, I, that's why I'm very, I was always, and I'm still very picky with the brand I represent because I want to be proud when I call you and I tell you, Laura, and you have to come to see that you would trust me because I never lied to you. And that was very my vision about this PR job. I want, and sometimes you need to do things that are maybe a bit more for money or what, you know, because we all, it's, it's a machine, you know, have a lot of staff and and even when I did an upload of stuff at it was even more difficult because each client was important. And, um, my, really my, my vision was to, to build a company, uh, with and making money as well, but with things we are proud of all my brand are very different. You know, it's not that I only have like intellectual brand or, um, uh, crazy eccentric brand. I have that, but I also have like, uh, more approachable, more affordable brand. But if I have a storytelling, if I have, um, a soul behind, if I can feel that I can tell something about the soul of this brand, then I do it. And, um, that's, that's quite basic, but that the way I built it, it's this, distrust between me and the media. And, uh, I think my team is doing the same. And, um, and I think it's, uh, it's important. And when we need media, maybe sometimes it's more difficult. We have like a collaboration to push that is not so good or make, make babies, not making so much sense for many reasons, internal reason, you know, sometimes the CMO decided that this collaboration is good or maybe put his friend, you don't know, like everything that can happen in our industry, you know, and if you need help, you can ask, but I ask, I said, you know, I need help there, but I don't do that every day. But I think it's, it's based really on trust and we are partners, all of us, media, brand, PR, um, communication, everyone is partners and we have to exchange and, uh, and to be a quite transparent. Yes. Yes. And I think because you do have taste and you are so transparent that if you send an email saying, well, you are really hoping to spread the word about this, it makes people pay attention and want to do it for you and also open all of your emails because your team is so responsive. And so you send a lot of emails, but like Jonathan, Sophia responded before Jonathan yesterday. No. I was like, oh, someone is, someone is racing. But you know, as, as a, as I appreciated so much as someone who I love, I try to respond if I don't, to the world, if I don't respond immediately, it's not, I try to, or the, I'll kind of forget. So, but, but I've all, I remember that when I went to an Olympia La Tante show that you did in a theater. Yes. With the, with, uh, the rockets. Yes. Yeah. And I remember that like thinking, and I didn't know you all and thinking these people are so responsive and so fast. It's incredible. It's just such a, and it, and it, it has helped you build your reputation. A question I have is how has, so when, when I started, I, I became a reporter in like 2006, but really started going to fashion shows in 2009, 2010 and going to showrooms. It was much more of a like a PR agency had a big showroom and, and trafficked a lot of samples because there were way more shoots at least in America of products on pages. And they were now, all those magazines will just pull a still from the brand, but they used to individually shoot every, I worked at Lucky magazine for a while and they would individually shoot every single product. Um, so it was much more about sample trafficking and also the story ideation was different because there wasn't as much imagery on the internet. So like stout.com, I think really only became a huge thing in 2008, 2009. It was around for five years before that, but there was still journal, fashion journalists. A lot of what they were doing was like describing the clothes and things. And now it can't just be that how has your job changed in job change in terms of like story placement and what media people want? It's, I know for me, it was what happened during the COVID, like when people start to say, oh, we won't need showroom anymore, blah, blah, blah, like I was totally thinking the contrary, like the showroom for me, the base, like sample trafficking, I always believe in it because we are, we have close, we need to put them on the editorial or we need to put them on a celebrity or we need to put them on an influencer. Whoever it is, they have to pass by the showroom, pick up the clothes, try them. And I'm actually doing this from our VIP room where the people, I try trying the clothes because it's the best sound I found in the building. So it's funny. I have a selection of clothes ready for an influencer, I think. So I always believe in the base of my job. The base of my job is sample trafficking, connection. And then there is new layering and there is new tool. So it's not about like exchanging the old tool or exchanging like what is new by what was there is more additionally. So that's why our job is kind of crazy now because we are still working on the old world with the old tool, but we have the new tool. It's not that we switch. There is an evolution, a strong evolution. Of course, people read less the papers, but when the papers are published on an application or are republished on Facebook or republished on Instagram or whatever, then people read those papers indirectly. They were printed, but an article of the New Yorker, an article of you talk about Katie Oren or whatever. Like you see now the cut, they putting the code of Katie on Instagram. They creating square with the code of Katie, like of course, the most juicy. And so now the media are also like evolving in a way that they know that probably the article will be more read on the web or on social media, but still they are existing in print. And me, when I work with big brand, they need to see the print, to see your love to see four page article. It matters to him. Maybe it's us, we will read it on our phone, but he will have him on his desk. So it's a kind of, you know, different, as I said, layering of information and you have to play with all of them. And the success is always like the connection between all of them. For when you have a show, you need a good review, you need a good front row, you need amplification of your front row, and you need that the celebrity request you write after the show to be the first one to wear it. And then you do another amplification with what the celebrity wore. And then you can also republish on your me, on your, if you like your review, you can publish your review and say, thank you so much for my beautiful review. You know, it's all, and when it's bad, it's the other one that reposes. But I mean, it's a 360 thing, you know, like it's what, and it's based on the creativity and on the collection, if the collection is not good, the collection is good. But sometimes people fight, they think the collection was good, but the other things, the collection was not good. And then you're creating buzz even more. You know what I mean? When people start to argue, or that's why it's interesting. Sometimes people say, oh my God, there was a bad review, or there was a bad buzz. But at the end, it's making so much noise that you win, the noise win right now. Yeah, I agree with that. And I also think I'm talking to people about controversial collections. It rarely happens anymore where there is a controversy. So when someone cares enough about something to write negatively about it, and or just discuss it in the front row, that to me means that the brand has power. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I totally agree. And it's not about, we can say bad publicity is good publicity or is publicity. Yes, it's true that also we are talking most of the time when there is not big drama, we are talking about clothes. You know what I mean? So who cares? You know, at the end, it's a discussion based on clothes. So it's fine. Nobody will die. It's all good. The worst case scenario, you don't buy it. And nobody can oblige you to buy a collection you didn't like. But it's interesting how people take fashions to swish. The process of accepting insurance outside of a group practice can be tough.

The industry itself has changed so much in the 18 years since you started your business. What is, just like media, what is the same and what is different now in the way that these companies operate? Because you work with everyone from Saint Laurent to Uniqlo and also a lot of tiny designers. And so you are doing, and now you have a business in the U.S. as well, which is a whole different market. How to you has the industry transformed? I think there is much more pressure because of the industry. It became an industry that is like when you see the success of LVMH or carrying Richmond, this company became so big, so worldwide, so pro-eminent. So there is a bit of more pressure because there is an economic pressure technically. Before it was like, okay, they were big, but they were not huge. And now they are monumental. In all the country, you know the name of those big brands. You can go in the Nile and it happened to me. I went to an island in the Philippines for Christmas and one girl was wearing a Jackmuse bag and I told her, oh, I work for this brand and she almost cried. So it was, it's crazy the power of the brand. So I would say that there is much more pressure. There is much more to do because of all these different tools. So now, you know, my team, they have to work on getting the people to the show, sit them, then do a report, then do a report of social media. Then do, you know, it's never like it's not only there is the before, the preparation, the stress before the preparation, the stress during the event and after the stress to deliver quickly the result. And so I would say that much pressure, a lot of more work for sure for the team, for me, for everyone involved, for the people in the house. And because fashion is big. And we are not the only one, we are not the only one in fashion to have social media. Everyone, like if you work for, I don't know, a car company or whatever, even healthcare or whatever, everyone is using social media, you know, it's not something proper to fashion. But in fashion, it fits us so well, it fits our model so well, you know, the social media. And also with the fact that the newspaper, the newspaper are big, but maybe the glossy magazine are a bit less important. And the social media took the power. And that's why now those magazines are all their platforms on social media are big, you know. And so everything is a bit more hysterical, a bit more fast. And but also very exciting because now if you are a young designer, before you need it to pass through different level of validation, you need it like, oh, Anna, we need to like my collection, then Barney's need to buy my collection. But maybe Anna will call Barney's to buy my collection. And like this one will like my collection can introduce me to this one. There was a lot of validation level. Now you can go straight to the people. Of course, you love to have Anna and Bergdorf and whatever, that's not the problem. But you can grow direct to people. And then maybe Anna will show her. You know, it's a different way of doing. And there will be people that maybe Anna will find before the other one. Oh, you know, it's all the, in France, on the cards, when you play the card, you know, and you, you mix them, you know, it's a bit that like now you don't know the recipe. The recipe is no recipe. But there is still button to push that are important. So it's a bit, but it's an amazing moment for a kind of direct democracy in the fashion. Because if your, your Instagram is amazing, it's descriptive, it's funny, then you can be noticed by the good people of fashion and they will support you. And look, look what happened to Becca, like Becca Stein.com from Georgia. When I met them, met him the first time. It's Clara Corny from Instagram that introduced me. I remember. And he was a fan. He was doing square about me. But I was scared. I was like, who is this guy? Why is he talking about me? And now you know, no. And, and then I met him and I, and I found this guy so genuine and his love for fashion was so strong. And so I really helped him like, and I remember when I put him the front, the first time on the front row and the Loïc Préjant came and told me, Oh, you put Stein.com on the front row. That's audacious. And I said, why not? Like it was, but because he was great, you know, and I will not do for everyone. But I think he became a media as well. And, and that's the beauty of fashion because he was interested. He attracted the attention of the good people. And then he made it. There is a magic in fashion. And what also what I love with Becca that is stay very positive, which for me, which for me, sometimes people complain, they are, he's always loving everything. For me, great, because I have anxiety with the fashion industry. I have anxiety with eight. So I'm really happy that Becca exists and bring a good vibe. As I agree, as someone who is constantly bringing anxiety to people like you, I, I love him. I think what he has done for me is he is my main source of news in some ways. Like he is so fast. Of course, I subscribe to all the trades and I read them, but he gets the information and he does much more than anyone else. So he reports on every little thing that happens and in on Instagram, where I spend way too much time and it makes it easier when he does a week in review. It's helpful to me. I don't need him to critique a show or give me the behind the scenes of why this thing was a mess. I don't care. I just want the information. And he's very good and smart and sharp about delivering it. And I don't think he can be a little too favorable, but generally I think he has a little bit of an edge of that he brings a cleverness to the writing. And I, I'm a huge fan and, and I think the like whenever there's backlash on stuff like that, the person just needs to, to kind of live through it. And then soon enough, he will be, I think of Brian Boyle a lot who started as a live journal blogger who's now a huge authority in the industry. And every time he posts on Instagram, I read it because I, I'm interested in what he said, but it, it takes people like you to recognize that and Eva Chen at Instagram or Clara at Instagram to recognize someone like Becca and say, okay, this is someone we need to engage with and, and because it's going to make the industry more fun and, and better known outside of so many people I know follow Becca who don't work in fashion and that's so valuable. It's one of the, of the people that now make you win followers. Like when you post about you, you win followers. And there is no, no, not so many. And the winning followers is the only currency that matter now. Yes. But not, it's, it's, it's, it's what I wanted to say about Becca is also really fact check. Yeah. And that's amazing. There is very few mistakes in his post. If I check, he work a lot at, and also it's interesting because digital is supposed to be fast and furious and to say like things as they come. And it's doing the, is fast and furious, but they're also fact check. And that's the key of a good journalism somehow. That's very, very true. And it's also, I've never thought about it because it's, but it is, and he is incredibly rigorous. And you can see that I'm not shocked for you to say that he, he checks everything very closely because it, I've never once gone on there and thought, oh, that's not true. Yeah. No, no, you really do. We exchange a lot. You exchange with my team. He asked, of course, the press release, but after he asked again, things, sometimes I learned things about my brand through him because I have to dig into things like which he had started, which he had to change this, which is like really like, is amazing for that is really taking that seriously. And people should pay tribute to that because it's time. Yes. It's not a due. You know what I mean? Because now the level of exigence on digital is low. Yeah. So yeah. And I wanted to just say something about Brian Boy because I was always amazed as he always embrace new things and become relevant in the new, like, as you said, he started with a blog. Then he became influencer when he was, he was good to become influencer. Then he did TikTok and he was big on TikTok. Then he became editor and chief of perfect and mixing the, the regular press to the digital world. And then, and now he's a star. And you know, he's always like so right on time. We think that it's kind of a, of really amazing. People like him and Becca would have been, I mean, he is, Brian is an editor-in-chief, but they would have been sort of, Suzy Laoh is similar. She's a really good thinker. They would have been a fashion director of the times of London or a magazine editor in a different era. But because of the way Leandra Medine is like this too, like she could have been the editor-in-chief of Glamour magazine in 1994 or Harper's Bazaar or what have you, but because the world has changed, they have this way to be more direct. And it is a credit to people like you and like a Katie Grand, who embraced the new and allowed those people to become establishment in a different way than existed when you were working at Saint Laurent in the couture, in, in the couture offices. Like it's, it's the establishment so exists, but it shifted and it required people who were part of the old guard to not to say you're old, but you know what I mean, to embrace that new. I love the old guard. You know, you have to accept cannot stay cool all your life. At one point you need to become a reference. It's true. It's true. Yes. So, so this idea of, of being established this past year, you sold your company to a bigger group called the independence, which is this sort of very well backed consortium of businesses that work in events and marketing and PR and strategy. And it's almost like a, for people outside of the industry, like a WPP, but for fashion and it's private right now, who knows in the future, but I'm sure they're going to buy more businesses. And I'm always very interested in, you know, everybody has an exit strategy now. I think 20 years ago that wasn't the way people thought. Like you just did your business and you did it forever and then maybe you closed it when you were done or, or, or you, but it wasn't like everybody, now everybody wants to sell their business eventually, but you did it. And it would, and what made you decide to do it? And what was, like, what do you see the future of PR looking like is for your, you and your team inside this bigger group, but then also just generally. Yes. So it's what you said is totally right. Like, because for me, it was the case. I never think I would sell my business because I was thinking my business would never interested people, you know, because it was my name on the door, like very like a personal way of doing things. Of course, with my team that, and, but we were really like, I mean, and, and then I think the independence before they buy me, they changed the deal, you know, when they decided to give to our job strains, because for me, it's what they done. They were the first one to regroup our job of services in luxury and fashion. And they give this idea that finally those company could be profitable, could be powerful, could be nobody was treating us like that before, you know, they give us this really the strains for me. And now there is more and more people that do like them. And it's great because there is many opportunities. And of course, the independence cannot buy everything. So it's great that there will be like, I think they really create when they left Asia, Isabelle and Olivier, they are the founder of the independence. And they bought Carlotto and then they bought Betak. And it started like that. They really like show that those company could be the interesting for business and not only like people who serve the others. And so I was really happy. First of all, that's why I joined them, because I love this philosophy that they respect our job of serving the business. And that they protect us somehow in giving us strains. For me, it was a long journey because I know them and I speak to them since maybe five years. So I went through a process, you know, and there was some discussion in the past where I was too small, it was not interesting for me at that time. So I wait, you know, I was not this easy. I was not this easy. I was not this easy. I was not this easy. I was not this easy. I was not this easy. I was not this easy. So I wait, you know, I was not this easy to sell, you know, I wanted to do it. It's something that you do once in your life for me in my case. So because I'm not an entrepreneur that has having several businesses and stuff like that, you know, I had my company and that's all and I sold it. So it's done for life, you know. So it was really important for me that I do it well. And of course, there was a personal aspect that I knew the founder and I respect them and we share the same value. And as well, I need it because the world is changing so fast. And I need it, I need it personally, I need it for my mental health to be with people next to me after 18 years of operation of a lonely entrepreneur, you know, and, and I'm so happy that we can share with people who knows our job issues, hope, problems, problem solving, best practice, like this is what is the independent and then after there is the synergy with the other people of the group. But that was for me, in fact, quite natural because I was already working with their production company. And I even can work with Carl Auto because, you know, now we are working on bigger, bigger scale event. And sometimes one agency is not enough. And I was already working with Carl Auto on several projects, like for example, we do shows where I do France and UK and they do the rest of the world or the, or when it's in Paris, sometimes I do front of the house and they do a specific country or it can be the same in New York and the same in Italy. As it is with KCD or other offices, you know, we always collaborate with other press offices. Like the client creates his own way of operating that can include different agency. So for me, the synergy was already existing. And I think there will be more interesting in the future, because I think we can pitch globally on some project or it's more and after how it's, I mean, it's very selfish, my decision, you know, I don't need to protect my, my company, you know, and to, to, to look at the future with less pressure. But I think the way the, the, the, our jobs are evolving is, is truly in that direction. But it, maybe it will create space for even more niche agency, you know, because in general, it's what is happening when there is, when there is things that are becoming bigger and and of course it's creating a space for something. It's what happened to me, you know, I arrived and I was very boutique and I was niche. And that was the key of my success. So maybe the fact that us will be coming bigger, maybe create space for someone smaller and it's great, you know, and everyone has his own agenda in life is a different age. I'm turning 50 this year, you know, my life is, is not the life of a, of a young guy that start in fashion, you know, I have different, I have a different agenda. And, but, and also after COVID, I think a lot of things change because our job were particularly affected. Like, in France, we were, we had a very like, really great help from the government. We have to be clear and, and, and we didn't suffer that much because they were paying the salary at our place. But a lot of clients like us for this count, most of them, some can serve the contract. So always things like I would have been very happy to have the independence with me at that time. Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's a pragmatic choice and, and it also just shows your outlook on life and the way you view the industry and you, the way you view the business is that it changes and you have to change with it. Yeah. And also, to be honest, nothing really changed for me, you know, they live, as their name said, they are, they, they really respect the founders. They want the founders to, you know, they are not stupid. If they, they, they buy you, they want you to be there and to do what you do as the best. And for me, it's PR. So they want to leave me, do my job at his best, you know, and it's look a bit like normal, what I'm saying, but I'm seeing that in other field. And it's not the same people buy company and they destroy them, you know. So it's not like, I'm very lucky that I'm with people who understand what is entrepreneurial, what is being a founder, and what is the industry of luxury. Well, they're very lucky to have you, Lucien. Thank you so much for taking the time. This was such a pleasure. It's so great to work with you. My conversation, it was like being with a friend at the coffee, you know, it was fabulous. It was really, really fun. You're the best. Thank you for everything. Thank you. No hands.
