Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Pucks Fashion and Beauty Memo Line Sheet. And today with me on the show is Who What Where co-founder Hilary Kerr. We're chatting the best and worst of the Oscars 2025 red carpet and plenty more. Happy Tuesday everyone. I am in Paris where I will be stationed for the next two weeks. First for 10 days of shows and the surrounding hoopla, and then for lots and lots of meetings, which I'll be doing a lot of those the whole time. I hope to see you. I love being in Europe because it's just a lot easier to do my job, or at least parts of my job. I did miss being in Los Angeles this past week and getting all the Oscar gossip. This week in Line Sheet, I wrap up the rest of Milan, share some thoughts on Saturday's ballet show as the company prepares for Simone Bellaté's now inevitable exit. And I also have some info on executive changes set to take place within LVMH, including new jobs for two of the R. No Kids. This stuff is supposed to take place like six months from now. So let's see how it all actually shakes out, but this is what people are within the business are saying at the moment. Sarah Shapiro, as Shapiro at Puck Dog News, if you want to email her, also has an interview with the team behind Doa and one of the rare American brands that is convincing enough to work on Europeans. They have a big presence in Paris. And also, I think their first wholesale account or one of their first was Netta Porte, and I think that helped as well. Be sure to check that all out and more, and let's get going with Hillary. Hillary Kerr, welcome back to Fashion People. It is my pleasure to be here. I love your podcast almost as much as I love the Line Sheet. So this is just a pleasure and a half to be here. Well, I love you. So I am glad that you are here. And vice versa. So you, we were just chit-chatting, pre-recording. You've been prepping. Yes, I love red carpet season. I probably should award season. I probably shouldn't be in the team's slack coming up with details and throwing things into the Google Sheets that we use when we're reporting on red carpets. I'm sure my teams would appreciate it if I'd stop doing that. But at the same time, I care so much. And I will be that weird person who's like forensically tracking down the number of carrots in the Bulgari necklace. I just, I am once a nerd, always a nerd when it comes to these details. This is why you're good at your job. And last week, before the show, you and Dan Constable from UTA hosted a sort of pre-Oscars party for or dinner for all the fashion people who were in town, right? Who couldn't go to the Prada show. Yes. Well, it was a really amazing night because, you know, when you've worked in this industry for so long, you realize there are certain people who don't necessarily, who make, have a ton of work and make our key decision makers, but maybe don't always get their flowers. And chief among them are the fashion PR teams at these major brands. Like as much as the celebrity stylists, they're the ones who are making these red carpet looks happen. They are connecting the stylists with the designer. They are making those introductions. They often are seeing the films before the rest of the world and saying like, oh, that Ruth Negafilm is going to do an amazing job. Oh, we should introduce Carla and Pierpolo at the time and like forming those relationships. So to have all of these teams in town from Europe, from New York, and then the LA teams, all in one place was so fun. And then we had a ton of celebrity stylists who came as well. And it was really remarkable to see, you know, one table sitting there. It's like the PRs from Fuiton and from Scapparelli and all of these different and Loewe, all coming, and Saint Laurent all coming together and having, you know, pasta, carbs before the red carpet and helping us raise a little bit of money for LA wildfire relief and, you know, everyone getting together and swapping tables and drinking wine. It was a really lovely evening. Dan Coswell gets all of the credit because that man was like creating invitations while on a plane to Milan and then coming back. I've never seen something come together so quickly and to have that kind of turnout was pretty outrageous. We missed you though. I'm really sad I missed it even though I was happy. I got to go to the prom show. But what I will say is that this is how these contracts, people want to know how these contracts get done. They get done by the publicist, the personal stylist, well, not the celebrity stylists, I am personal stylist, the agents, the managers, like this is how the contracts get done. And the one thing I think I learned moving out to LA that I didn't really realize was how deeply involved the publicists were in the process. More than just like matching up a celebrity with a brand, they are part of the strategy and it's, and you're right, they don't get any credit. So shout out to all of them. They don't want their names ever published. But they're all fabulous and really do incredible work. And let's be honest, they're also the keeper of all of the secrets. Those teams have seen things that I am not allowed to repeat, but oh my goodness, they know all. So like really, I feel like it's in everyone's best interest to bow down to the celebrity VIP teams. That is true. So let's break down what they did last night and how they, if they succeeded or failed. I mean, so what was your overall, your overall feeling about Oscars 2025 red carpet? So I think that I always try and look at it from two different perspectives, the civilian in me and then also like the long-term fashion editor. So from, I think the civilian in me would not have understood some of the things that were on the red carpet would be absolutely perplexed by them. The fashion editor in me was thrilled, especially to see some of the after party looks, but even the red carpet looks like we saw sculptural moments, the likes of which we don't usually see. We saw, there was, I always prefer it when there's a little bit more color myself on the red carpet, but we saw so much interesting texture and embellishment and beating and design. And it just felt like a lot of people got the same memo one and two, to me, it was a much more interesting red carpet than some of the like classic jewel tone strapless mermaid gown that we've seen a hundred thousand times. Like this was a little bit wilder and I really liked it, plus a fair amount of vintage as well, which is always nice to see. Yeah, I mostly agree. I think there are two things on the sort of downside, the negatives of my assessment are that there was way too much just sequins. And there's this idea of wearing like a fitted dress with a bunch of sequins on it has been a thing for the last few years in informal gowns, regardless. And I had Kate Young on probably last summer and she was talking about this, you go to a brand and all they have is like a silver sequined dress. There were a lot of those again. I think right now there's a huge emphasis on body and being fit. And so there's a desire to want to show that off. And a good way to show that off is through a sequined dress that is form fitting or what have you. But it feels like an evolution from the naked dress, which we were seeing a lot of for so many years, where it's not like, I feel like the even more intense version of that is like, we're going to have that sequined, that bedazzled dress, but with nothing on underneath it. And we've seen a lot of that over the years as well. Yes. Yes. And I would also say that everything fit better this year. There was a there, something has happened that the celebrities realize or their teams or whatever, they finally are starting to realize this is how we need to make it work. So it looks good being photographed. I'm sure they were thinking about that previously, but it feels like something clicked and there weren't usually you see the right and you're like, Oh, that didn't fit her at the top. Like there are a couple of things like that. But generally I thought even in the men's clothes, the men's stuff, which the men really took a lot of risk, which I loved. I just thought everything like sort of fit like the tailors were working overtime and I appreciated that. I also wish there was more color. I just love, I love Michelle Yeo in Balenciaga. It was like a royal blue duchess satin color is where you can, it was just like a pretty, I mean, it was beautifully done and draped in all of that, but it wasn't like such an out of the ordinary dress, but the color gave it a bit of a strangeness. And I really, I love that in particular. Same thing with Timmy and butter yellow leather. Like is the look revolutionary? Not really. It's still just pants and a jacket, but at the same time, at least like you saw that panning of the full audience and your eye went straight to that fresh out of the gate, Sarah Burton, Givenchy look. And it's like, I love that I could ID him at a thousand paces. It reminded me a little bit about what Elizabeth Holmes always writes about with the Royals about them dressing in colors so that you could see them at a distance, like easily identifiable. And I was like, we, and I know it was a nod to a classic Bob Dylan look. So like, I love all of the backstory to that. But I mean, seeing that or Coleman Domingo and Valentino and that red was so phenomenal. I mean, look, I'm also like my favorite all time Oscars look is Nicole Kidman in that incredible chartreuse. I think it was Dior dress from the nineties, 1997, I want to say, like that's what my personal taste standard is. Like give me something like a shocking color with like a thoughtful element. So did we see that as much? No, but we saw still there was enough that was interesting this time around. And certainly I was like, yeah, the men brought it too. Yeah, let's talk about the guys for a minute. You mentioned Coleman Domingo and the most a shallow may that's how I really think that's how you pronounce it. Anyway, first of all, this kid has so much style. It's crazy. I loved it. I was trying to go to sleep because I had to get up very early this morning and was already late. And I was just like, damn, this kid has it. Did you see his little baby like a Cartier bracelet and watch like he's so much swag and then like a bit of Cartier necklace. I mean, I there's complex, had this amazing picture of just his wrist and it's like to see the the mini watch with the bangles. It's like this guy is going for it. It is so fun. So much personality across the board. Like clearly, I think that we've seen so many like homogenized, like very boring, safe things. So then to see this, just he just felt like a breath of fresh air the whole campaign through. Totally. He looked and he looked great at the VF party in Hyder Ackerman's Tom Ford. I thought that was gorgeous as well. Coleman always, he was wearing Valentino. He always, he is sort of the gold standard. He has incredible style. It looks like him. It always fits super well. And he's very handsome. He doesn't look crazy wearing prints. He looks, he really wears the clothes. Yeah. And so I thought that was Jeremy Strong in Laura Piana. Yeah. I bow. It was so good. It was so good. He's, he's, there wasn't really, I'm trying to think of one. I thought Sebastian Stan in Prada, it was like his shirt was in off white and his tie was a little loose. I love that. It all looked great. And usually I'm like very traditional. I like a guy in a nice suit and I still like that. But, but I thought that Sean Baker in custom Dior, which was like a really standard suit, the style by our friend Rebecca Ramsey. Congrats to Rebecca. She's excellent. So good. She has such an interesting roster. She only works like cool creative people who do amazing shit. So I'm so happy for her. And he looked really handsome and it was like, are just a great tux that fit him well. Yeah. I love Jeff Goldblum in Prada. Always. He's one of my favorites. I just think he has so he's, he looks like he's actually having fun, which you just don't see that very often and it makes me really happy.

You know who else I thought looked really nice? Who apparently everybody is goo goo over is Andrew Garfield at the party. I think he was wearing Gucci at both, but at the Vanity Fair party, he had on gray, like had to tow gray Gucci. And I thought he looked really great as well. How do you feel about men wearing sunglasses on the red carpet? Was he wearing them? Yes. I'm not into, no, it's silly. I don't, I don't like that kind of stuff, but whatever. I didn't notice. I just thought that the, the clothes look great. I don't mind, but I, for most things, I am a little bit of a traditionalist when it comes to the Oscar red carpet. I, it's the only time where I feel like you need to be just a smidge more traditional. And for me, that was the only, like the, the look overall was phenomenal. The sunglasses on the red carpet. I'm like, do we must we, that's the one, it's the one time. Yeah. Yeah. It, it, that feels a little silly. The other question for you is brooch or no brooch. So the brooch thing happened. I mean, there needs to be some play on words because it's like the bro brooch, the brooch. I don't know how you would spell that on GQ.com, but maybe same high nose. This happened a while ago, like at least Emmys, right? Or last year. It happened when Jamie Mizorahi started putting like a Tiffany brooch on Jeremy Allen White was one of the first big moments when we saw it. And then it has been off to the races. It feels like ever since. I will say, I think I'm, I'm out. I'm done. Like, think of something else. That's the thing about Jeff Goldblum. They don't have that many places for flair though. Lauren, let them have a tiny bit of flair. Sure. I'm, let them get the money that they'll get when they get the diamond contract. But, but I thought Jeff Goldblum have on a brooch. I don't think so. He had on that beautiful like lavender scarf. I was super into the scarf and a printed top, an off white jacket and this scarf. It's fine. I just think the guys that I liked weren't wearing, maybe Sebastian Stan was wearing a brooch. I didn't even notice, but it, but it is, I got some DMs, people asking what I think. And I said, I've already, I'm past the brooch. I've already processed the brooch. I never mind a fine jewelry moment on the red carpet. I am a magpie. I am a crow. I just want to see shiny things, glittery things. I love stones. I am, I feel like there are so few opportunities for men to, although men are doing better with accessorizing generally speaking lately and there's been more man jewelry, but I just, I don't know. I'm, I'm all for it because it, it's a little bit of personality. It's a little bit of flair. It's another, it's just another detail. And I get so bored by seeing the same classic tasteful tux over and over again. I'd rather see something that's just even like slightly questionable or maybe a little overdone because it's just more interesting to me. Otherwise they all look the same. You know what else was interesting? I thought this season, the big brands always flood the market. They'll have, you know, 10 or 15 major people that they dress and a lot of them did that this season, but I thought the brands that really stood out were Givenchy, not only with Timoté, but also with Elle, with Elle Fanning, which was also Sarah Burton and just gorgeous. And I wrote in line, she's not Monday. I think Elle Fanning and Samantha McMillan are just maybe the best stylist, star duo working right now or, or rising up. They, they really, Elle has incredible personal style and there's so many things. She wore a Balmain dress that had like a leopard. Yeah. Leopard print bra top recently that that sounds, that doesn't sound good when I say leopard bra top, but Google Elle Fanning Balmain, this dress was gorgeous. She has amazing personal style. I thought that the white lace dress and the sort of cape back was just so beautiful. I thought she looked fantastic. It's a black bow done right as well. I found the neckline, the neckline is not like my personal high point because I think it can be a little bit when there's that like semi-sweet heart aspect to it. I think it's a, it reads a little juvenile personally. That is my only critique of the look overall. And that's just my own personal bugaboo. I think she looked flawless and I really liked her Vanny Fair look as well. Yes. I loved it. I loved the black with red. It was so great. Those pops of red work great. Yeah. I think the, I would have not done the shoes. I would have done black shoes, not red shoes, but I thought the red sash was, was so gorgeous. Not, not that Samantha McMillan needs my notes. The other brand. Sarah Burton needs mine. We're just talking. We're just, we're just chatting. Either the other one that I thought was, I thought Balenciaga a lot. I thought Rachel Senate, including the face she was making and all the photos. I thought she looked great. A lot of the Balenciaga people, like Kim Kardashian looked beautiful. I thought she looked great. I thought Saint Laurent did a killer job. The Zoe, both Zoe's. Zoe saw Donia and then Zoe Cravitt. Cravitt's cheeky moment. Yeah. With her little rear peeking out from the back and never have I been more jealous. I also, I love a prim from the front sassy in the back moment in general. Like I liked Margaret Quali, where it's like, you can see the necklace in the back and then the front looks sort of like severe or simple. And then you turn around and all of a sudden there's a plunging back. There's a beautiful dress moment or there's a little bit of cheeky bum in the case of Zoe Cravitt's. I thought it was great. It made me very happy. I thought it was lovely. It felt fresh. And I mean that in a number of ways, cheeky. And I mean that also in a number of ways, but it just felt like young and fun. And also she's always sort of pushing things a little bit. And that feels right for her. Totally. Both of those. And also the Hailey Bieber cellar on dress. They all felt like they were beautiful. They made the women look good, but they were also really fashion. And that was very refreshing. Sarah Paulson in Mark Jacobs fashion, which was also another major moment. Or I also, I have to say like I really loved what our wicked ladies did. I loved the Scapparelli gown, especially considering how like they made it even more special by adding all of those additional. I know you're not as much team embellishment as I am, but all of those embellishments on the skirt of it and I also thought Cynthia Arrivo looked absolutely stunning. I love the dress that Jason, Jason Bolden had this idea of this nod to Hattie McDaniels, which I think is such a lovely idea. And to see her in that super dark green, Vuiton dress. I just, I, again, it was such a stunning moment. And I loved that. And going back to brands, the Vivian Westwood moment for her performance. Phenomenal. Like I love a vintage Vivian Westwood moment. Like that also. And the same thing. I also loved the Scapparelli, you know, not everyone loves like the literalness of the red shoe on Ariana's back, but I thought it was stunning, thoughtful, interesting, and a little playful, which is also something I love. I thought it was the best Ariana has looked this entire row. And she's looked great. And Cynthia Arrivo has amazing style and always she mostly wears Louis Vuitton, but really wears it well. And they choose the right things because Louis Vuitton dresses many, many people. And sometimes it's not, you know, it's always a mixed bag for all these brands. But I think with her, they all, they tend to, she's the right match for that brand. I thought, I loved, I loved that green velvet as well. And the champagne Scapparelli straight off the runway was it was the platonic ideal of an Oscar dress. Yeah. And also an Oscar's dress and what she should be wearing. And I'm pro embellishment when it makes sense. And I think in that case, it really makes it. This show is brought to you by Boga, the brand on a mission to inspire more mindful oral care.

It was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll, and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out. It was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th. Follow and listen on Apple podcasts, the Odyssey app, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcast. So let's talk about Mikey. Yes. So I, this is my feeling about it. I think that Jamie Mizrahi does the best job when she is dressing women who like to be dressed in classic clothes. I think Adele is her sort of masterpiece. And she, she's done a great job with Jennifer Lawrence, too. Someone who has had many stylists and I think has finally sort of figured it out. And the same with Mikey, you can tell this is not a person who, you know, obviously, in Norris, a very, I guess you could say it's a very edgy movie. I keep calling it Our Generations, My Cousin Vinnie, but whatever. I loved it. It was my favorite movie of the year and deserved everything. Not Challengers? Man. I did love Challengers, but I really loved, you know what, they were robbed with the soundtrack though, the score. That was the best. I mean, I'm sure your husband Jonathan also agrees that I cannot believe they were not even nominated. I know. I was extremely offended by that. Anyway, I thought Mikey looked great. And the color was right. The idea was right. It wasn't my favorite thing she's worn. That is how I would put it. It wasn't. And the same thing for Demi Moore, who was her competitor and best actress. She's looked incredible this entire run and has looked really, really good in particular in Scaparelli, but always and she wore Armani last night and silver. She looked beautiful and amazing. Neither of those dresses were my favorite things that they've worn on this tour. I would say. Well, I think one thing that has been interesting for me watching Mikey is that it feels like there's interesting storytelling that we're seeing through these campaigns, right? I feel like Andrew and what he did with Margot Robbie for Barbie, it's like reset the level of how folks dress for a campaign. And then you see varying degrees of it. So there have been clear color thematic moments for Ariana and Cynthia throughout this entire Wicked Press Tour, which by the way, I'm going to be very interested to see how this goes for Wicked Part Two. When it comes out, are we going to keep this going? Are we going to change things up? I think there you look at what Brad Greski did with Demi Moore and there's so much interesting thoughtfulness. It's a subtler take on the substance and nods to that character throughout this campaign season. And then there's Mikey where it feels like it's been interesting to see if the sex worker character and then a very old Hollywood glam throughout the course of this campaign, which obviously was something that they settled on. But I kept thinking where it's like, I loved how she looked. I loved, I personally, old Hollywood glam is sort of my fondest spot. But I think I personally loved the Vanity Fair dress more. Yes, the black with those sort of plunging V neckline. Who was it? That was both were archival based on archival Christian Dior. One was, I'm going to find this exactly because I wrote it down because I thought it was so cool. So the black dress was from the fall, winter, 1956, 1957 couture show with a shawl, which I'm just like, dear Lord, that is all kinds of incredible to put it mildly. Yes. I agree. I thought she also looks great in black, which not everybody does, but she's very fair and has dark hair and looks fabulous in black for whatever reason, her coloring or, and I thought the pink, the pink also reminded me it was a very different dress, but of the Gwyneth Paltrow, Shakespeare and love Ralph Lauren dress. This arguably fit Mikey better than the Gwyneth Paltrow dress fit Gwyneth, but I love the way it fit, even though it didn't fit. It's burned in my brain as the most the prettiest girl in the world. But anyway, yeah, I agree. And I also think she also reads very young to me. So she is, she's 25, but there are 25 year olds who are wearing too much filler. Yeah. And that's one thing I really noticed. And this is not new, but it's just again, like, and you don't want to judge people they're under so much pressure, but there just is a lot of augmentation in a way that is what's real and what's attractive. What's is realness attractive is the augmentation, what people are attracted to now. There's a lot of like armchair psychology you could do just by looking at the same thing with the SNL. It's kind of like dovetails the SNL special, which the whole time all I could think about was how old everyone was and how much work they've had done. So I think that for me, it's I miss realty. I'll just come out and say I think that we are in an over veneer situation. Yes. I think that seeing the reaction to white lotus and an overbite in the wild is amazing. I think there are certain celebrities. If you saw mall rats back in the day, you could say like, oh, we understand why certain leading men had veneers to be in certain films. But I think for the most part, that's part of why like everyone looks the same because everyone has kind of the same smile. And that is actually the thing that's like grating on me because I think what we all like, it's part of the reason why Timmy has had such like, I think is such a sensation is because he is a personality, not talking about his teeth in this case, but we are seeing what feels like authenticity, a personal, a sense of personal style, personal anecdotes going on all of these random shows and podcasts, like seeing different aspects. People love authenticity. And we just keep getting the same. It's like the same filter has been applied to everyone. And that is boring to look at. Like I personally love seeing some of the actresses who are in their 40s and 50s who have not changed their lips to whatever size. And again, to your point, like they're under incredible pressure. But I miss seeing real faces and that whenever I see a real face, it just delights me. Yes. I had dinner on, I don't remember which night, I think Friday night in Milan with some women in their 30s and they were talking about getting braces on their lower teeth. And I was like, don't do that. Which I, again, you don't want to judge people because everybody has to do what is going to make them feel better. I am constantly thinking about the ways I can improve myself and do, you know, everybody has things they want to do to move forward. Well, for instance, for your bite though, like that's a real thing. These people just like had a little bit of messed up lower teeth and I was like, your teeth look great. I don't know. Don't do that. It's more fun to have. But you know, I'm going to disagree with you on that because your teeth continue to shift as time goes on and they can become more misaligned and pregnancy, your teeth get loose and move around. And it can affect your bite and it can affect the health of your teeth. So we're going to disagree on places. I just forgot that you're an invisible line stand. I am not an invisible line stand, but I am really into bite and we don't want grinding teeth and we don't want our teeth to be unhealthy because they're the only teeth we have. You know, I grind my teeth. My teeth are in great shape. Well, we'll talk in 30 years and see how you do it. Well, talk. Yeah. No, no cavities here. Anyway. Yes. So the point is we're not judging anybody because we really can't. But you really, you really can't. These people are under tremendous amount of pressure. It just is what you're saying. It can be boring to look at. And yes, there are younger people who you look at them and you're not. And I don't really think any of the younger people last night fall in this bucket, but there are some younger people right now that you're just like, why are you doing this to you? Oh, there was actually, there is someone last night who I will not say, but I was just like, this person's career is over because they've done so much to their face already. I do not know who you're talking about. And I am very interested. I'll tell you offline. I don't want to be mean about that. But speaking of being mean, I think we should talk about what we don't. Yeah. Well, we don't like. Now you can be more diplomatic than me, but here are my least favorite looks of the night. I thought that Kylie Jenner's Mew Mew was not correct. I did not love it. I love Mew Mew. I don't think this was the right dress for the occasion, not to sound like someone who is ancient, but that was a great Grammy stress, in my opinion. Agreed. And I, and I think that she has looked very cool at these events with him in other like, I think she wore vintage jeevon. She wants, she can do it. You can look sexy, but you don't, it just wasn't right. And I didn't think that the Sydney sweetie version of it was either. I didn't like Whoopi and Christian Siriano. You kind of can't fault anything Whoopi does. So that's a hard thing to say, but I just. Wait, didn't he do Halle Berry as well? Yes, which, yeah, which I wasn't, I thought she looked nice, but. I thought that fit was really impressive. Yeah, yeah. The one that I really didn't like was on a Darnus in Louis Vuitton. Isn't it interesting though that we saw so many of those high neck halter? It's sort of like a more athletic look, but I feel like that was something, I hesitate to call it a halter. And I, because I tend to think of halter as being more of like the halter strap, but that high neck sort of like swim almost halter top. It felt like the halter that was everywhere or that it was certainly having a moment, but with that degree of like the contrast between that and the black, it felt like a little bit like. I feel like it would have looked great on Kyra Gerber. It wasn't right. She's very petite. And it wasn't right on a very, I mean, maybe she's not, but she just, she reads on TV very petite. It didn't make sense for her. And I don't know what makes sense for her. My whole thing with her is like, what is her? I know she has this big movie coming out soon, the spin off of I don't, John Wick or whatever, Ballerina. I don't know what any of this means. I just know that the, that's what it's called. I, I don't know who she is. I used to run by on Glendale when I lived in Silver Lake. I used to run by an advertisement of her shilling natural diamonds. Then I hear that she's going on dates with Tom Cruise and then she shows up in this dress. I want to know who this person is. The only thing that I relate to her on is that she dated Ben Affleck. Like I can understand why you would do that. Maybe I think that you speak for all of us. And also she was so good in Knives Out. Like she's, she's obviously in that movie, she's going to be a big star. There's just something going on with her and that dress was like the, it was the moment where I was like, no, this, I'm out. I'm out on her. I did not have such a strong reaction. I thought it was like, it fit. I thought it was, I thought it was fine. It just wasn't, it, to me, it wasn't a moment that I will look back on for years to come and say like, wow, but I also, I don't find it nearly as offensive as you did. I don't know if anyone did. I was trying to find people to text about. I know one wanted to discuss it. It just was not the thing that like set me on fire. I was just mostly, again, I think I really wish that there was more noteworthy color on the red carpet. That was the thing. That was my biggest note was like, it felt like everyone got the same metallic embellished beaded and some of it was very well executed, but it just felt very marginalized in that way. And I like weird, I like quirky, I like romantic, I like a lot of things. I like sculptural, but it did feel like we, like everyone kind of was, was singing from the same hymn book or whatever that phrase is because I'm not religious. So that was, that was my, my overall concern primarily. Final question and it's connected to this. I wonder if that is happening and that sort of like sameness other than the fact that people are in, in some ways want to be more careful about how they present themselves. But the other thing that's happening right now is that there are so many brands without designers. So there aren't a lot of the red carpet stuff feels very anonymous, whereas usually, and that's why maybe that San Laurent and Givenchy and Valenciaya really popped because their designers are very present at those brands currently in Scaperoni. Yes. And, and so I wonder if next season, I actually thought all the Chanel looks looked really good. I thought the Dior looks were, were good. But I wonder if next season, that will all sort of pop off as well, you know, Matt Tubalazzi is not showing his first collection to October. So it wouldn't be starting with Emmys, but by next Oscar season, they'll all be installed and we'll have a whole new crew of designers running, you know, the in between times at Gucci, I thought Laura Dern looked amazing as she was one of the ones I really loved. So I, my take on that was actually more that that's why we saw more vintage than usual on the red carpet and for the parties and being like Kendall wore early nineties, Mugler, Kaya was in late nineties, Valentino, we had Mikey in that, you know, fifties vintage Dior, Jenna Orquitega was in archival Donna Karen collection, Kiki Palmer was, I mean, like there was just, there was a lot of archival and vintage and I think that people are leaning on that more and more. But I actually think the rise of vintage might have more to do with it than the lack of creative directors. That's just my own theory. Also, I just want to say, I love the fact that we saw some unusual fashion accessories. Like we saw, it felt like we saw gloves in a new way that I have not seen on the red carpet, like Miley's little McQueen gloves, Zoe Saldana's very high sheer Saint Laurent gloves, Scarlett Johansson had velvet gloves, like we saw more, like I just feel like in between all of the different gloves, more architectural shapes, gentlemen in more jewelry and pizzazz, like I felt like this was actually a very fashiony red carpet. Again, I don't know how that will translate to civilian tastes, but I enjoyed the heck out of it and also seeing the vintage and also I've not seen that much Vivian Westwood and I can't tell you how long. It just felt like there was more, it felt like different designers than we normally see, which to your point, I think that vacuum of creative directors allowed more people to sort of step up. Anyway, I just thought it was fun. Agreed. One of my friends said it was the best red carpet in 20 years and another person was extremely bored. Everybody has an opinion, Hillary. Including us. Whenever there's something that feels even I'd rather see something not flawlessly executed, but different and something that has aspiration than something super, super safe. So that's the lens that I always look at this stuff through. I agree. Next up, Met Gala. Are they all going to be there? I can't wait. It's going to be a really good one. Thanks for taking the time on such a busy day for you. Always. There is no one who I'd rather talk to about all of this and you know that I'm just a nerd for all these details anyway. Next year, hopefully I'll be there. Yes, for carbs before the red carpet. Yeah, that part. I'm not going anywhere else. Thanks, Lauren. Thanks, Hillary.
