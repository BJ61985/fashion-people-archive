Hi and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman. Have you tried the pants? And by the pants, I mean the high sport kick flares made out of a stretchy, fancy engineered knit. They were created by Los Angeles based Alyssa Zachary, who cut her teeth at none other than the row and Kate. In 2021 launched High Sport, her very own line of chic sportswear separates to as much fanfare as I have ever seen in my 20 years covering this business. It was absolutely wild. But while everyone was talking about the pants, no one really knew much about Alyssa, who rarely gives interviews and prefers, not unlike her former employers, to stay out of the press. Lucky for you, I convinced her to join us here right on Fashion People to discuss what the last few years have been like. P.S. for all you high sport freaks, I hear they're launching e-commerce soon. So there will be one more way to shop the goods. Let's get started. Happy Friday, everyone. I am still somehow in New York City. I am heading to London soon for the Gucci Resort Show. And for a bunch of meetings, I can't wait to see all of you there. And then I'm going to Savannah for the Scads graduation. Then I'm going home to Los Angeles. I can't wait. I will be there for the foreseeable future. This week in New York, I had a great time, did a ton of reporting. Sorry to the people I canceled on because I was reporting, but the work comes first, people. I did manage to make it to a dinner hosted by Alina Cho for Kate Holstein on Wednesday night. And that was really fabulous. They are both great people. And the crowd was good. And we talked fashion. We talked the industry. But then we also talked about movies and travel. And it was just a really nice post-met chill dinner. So thank you for having me, Isabella. You're the best. And then on Thursday night, I hosted a really fun thing with a bunch of fashion writers and industry people at Studs new fine jewelry store. So Studs is the piercing company, sort of wants to revolutionize your piercing experience. And so they gave piercings to people and they just launched fine jewelry. So it was really fun. It was an interesting experience for me. It was an interesting experience for me and for all of you who came out to it, thank you. And I hope you had a great time and enjoyed your piercing. I did not get another piercing. I've had my second piercing since I was seven years old. And that was enough for me. So a lot of people did get them and they looked great. I love the whole scene. Yesterday on Line Sheet, I had a big story about WME fashion and IMG models and the whole reorganization and everything that's going on there. It's pretty in depth and I did a lot of reporting on it. So please check that out. And then on Wednesday, my partner, Rachel Struegatz, had a great story about Estee Lauder and what's happening there. Estee is a company I've covered in and out over the years. Rachel is really the domain expert on that. But I find it so fascinating because it was riding high for so long and it's a category leader and it's just one of those companies that feels like it just will never slow down. And in the last couple of years, they've had a lot of challenges and it's interesting to see what happens when you feel invincible and suddenly you're not. So please check out Rachel's story. I also have the requisite HR moves. There is an exit at Net-A-Porter that you should read about and also a little bit about Lorenzo Bertelli, the son of the Prada family and what he said about them being open to acquisitions, which I think that could be a big story for us at some point. But if you have any thoughts on what he said, let me know. And today, as I mentioned in the intro, we have Alyssa Zachary, who is the designer of High Sport and she's just a really interesting person and doesn't do a lot of press. And it's funny, she actually worked for Kate Holstein for a good while. So everybody's connected. There is no avoiding people. That is what I will say. They always come around. And one thing is that I forgot to ask Alyssa what she had for breakfast, unfortunately, when we recorded this. It was a pretty fast recording. So apologies that you're missing out on that. But I will confirm that she does eat food. I've had dinner with her. Let's get started with Alyssa. Alyssa Zachary, thank you for being on Fashion People. Welcome, my friend. Hi, Lauren. Thank you for having me. I'm so happy to be here. You're happy to be here. I'm happy you're here. The word, I essentially forced you to do this because I've known you pre-High Sport and known you for a long time. We both live in LA. We've gotten to know each other since I moved here. And your business is incredible, but you don't talk about it a lot. And I thought it would be interesting to have you on and find out who is High Sport and why the heck did you do this and what you're actually up to, like what your big plan is. So to start, let's make it easy. Let's talk about how we met because I feel like I am the preeminent expert on High Sport. But I actually have not written about it that much. If you look, I wrote something at my old job. I'll mention it occasionally in Line Sheep. But I haven't done a big picture story, but I feel like I know so much about the brand. But let's talk a little bit about how we met and how you started the company. By the way, Lauren, in answer to your question, the reason that I did this, because you asked me, so that's a testament to our friendship. Let's start with who you are and what High Sport is. So what did you do before you started High Sport? Well, I've been working in the fashion business for 25 years. I started working retail when I was in high school. I grew up in Dallas, Texas. And I worked retail for a number of years. When I graduated from college, I was in the Macy's merchandising program, which at that point was, you probably know this, but at the time there were a number of executive training programs at the big department. And that was sort of the plum job to get if you were interested in getting into the business of fashion. And so I did that. And then I went back to school. I went to Parsons to get my design degree. So that's when I really not only started to work with product directly in terms of designing and draping and sketching and patterning and making things with my hands, but also that allowed me to pivot into the designer business. So after Parsons, I joined the row where I worked for almost a decade, beginning as an intern. And then through to becoming the director of merchandising, I was there for about eight and a half years. And then I went on to join the Kate team for their launch. That was in 2016. And then I moved to LA with my family in 2017. And that's when High Sport began to percolate. You and I met during COVID because I remember chatting with you. Who introduced us? Was it Max Steiner? Was it Danielle McGrory? Oh, two dear friends of mine. Well, I believe it was Max. Although why do you mention Danielle? Could it have been her? I think, you know what? I think it was Max. But I think Danielle had mentioned you because you also worked at the line, right? Like when you were doing Kate, you were somehow connected to the line, correct? I guess they were the same company, assembled brands. That's right. Okay. For anyone who doesn't remember the line was this incredible. There were two stores that were in home, essentially these little apartments. There was an apartment on Green Street and then one off of Melrose Place. And they had in-house brands, including Kate, but then they sold like Loewe. They had the best selection ever. I was completely obsessed with it. Wasn't it sort of the first among the first of experiential retail? I mean, the concept was an apartment. Like you said, it was on the second floor on Green Street. There was no signage. So it was sort of, you know, you had to be in the know. You had to seek it out. And then it was merchandise as an apartment, complete with a bathtub where they were selling bath goods. So it was a fully, you know, top to bottom experiential retail. I hope you do. I have a hilarious photo of me and a friend in the bathtub on the opening night, like our feet hanging out. Everybody took photos in the bathtub. It was very, very clever of them. So we missed that story. When you and I chatted though, you were in the middle of developing high sport, but you also were interested in journalism. And we talked about you maybe doing a column. So what was in your mind in this would have been spring of 2020, because I was still living in Brooklyn. I remember having a conversation with you and sitting at my desk in my basement apartment in Bed-Stuy. And what was going through your mind at that time? Because you had left Kate, you were sort of developing high sport, but you were also thinking about writing. You had all these different things going on. First of all, you were very generous to have that call with me, because in retrospect, to call someone who's among the best in their field and say, I'd like to do what you do. Just tell me how to get my foot in the door is pretty brash. But at that point, high sport had been in development for already three and a half years. And so that was a really long and sort of frustrating period of knowing exactly what I wanted to bring to market. But almost having my hands tied in my ability to bring it. It was an arduous process to develop high sport. And so I think, you know, there we were at the beginning of COVID. And I actually shortly thereafter had my first full sample set that I did start to service to stores. I think that I probably was a bit frustrated with the process. That said, I still have an interest in journalism. And you never know, Lauren, I might come for you. I welcome it. I think you'd be great. You're super smart and you are curious. And those are the, I know you don't even need to be smart to do it. Let's be honest, just curious, but you're both. So why were you so frustrated? What was taking so long? Why did it take so long to develop? It was a couple of factors. So first of all, I was intent on creating something new or let me back up. I wanted to make, you know, I reflected on my experience in the fashion business, which by this point was 20 years. And, you know, everything that I had learned at the row at Kate and at the number of other businesses that I worked with in four over the course of my career. And that sort of coupled with the style that I experienced on my move to LA and the way that I saw people dressing here, I thought there was an opportunity for clothing that looked elegant, wore well, you know, I know everybody says day to night, but truly wore beautifully throughout the day and, you know, really created a modular wardrobe. So I was interested in the idea of separates that could be mixed and matched, not only within seasons, but between seasons. I like the idea of longevity in these pieces. And so, you know, I was sort of interested in the idea of creating this modular wardrobe. And I wanted to, I had an idea of what I wanted the fabric to be. And because the pants were, you know, very much a cornerstone of the line, they needed to perform really well. And it was extremely difficult to, and they're knit, of course. And so, you know, that means that we select the raw materials and we create the stitch, and then the pants are created from there. And so it was extremely difficult both to find the raw materials that we needed to create the pants, but and would perform the way that we needed them to perform, but also to find a factory partner who was willing to work with, you know, essentially a mom in Los Angeles who wanted to had a dream. A mom with a dream. So, you're talking about this knit. And to me, the way I have described it to people, and I probably have written about it, it reminds me of like an Alaya knit. It has a really good return. So it's a knit, but it's an engineered knit that kind of holds you in and gives the body a silhouette. It's not like wearing a knitted sweater that's just kind of flopping around everywhere. And finding that kind of material, A, when you started using it right now, that engineered knit has become a little trendier, I would say, for several reasons, including the success of high sport. But when you started using it, it wasn't as, it wasn't a thing a lot of brands were dipping into so much, at least from what I could tell. Why were you interested in doing knit first and not woven? You obviously have the experience across all types of materials. Well, at first of all, we didn't find that fabric, we created it. So, you know, that isn't to say that stretch knits or compact knits didn't and don't exist on the market, but we wanted to create a fabric that was ultra luxe and incredibly high performing, but also machine washable, mad in look so that, you know, it would wear well during the day. It wouldn't have, you know, at the outset, I didn't want it to have a sexy feel. I wanted it to really have a daytime sort of modern sportswear feel to it. So, we actually created the fabric that we were looking for. And I didn't originally know that we would end up knitting. I looked for fabric on the open market. I looked at jerseys, I looked at, you know, other sort of knit fabrics that could be bought on a roll. And the reality is that we couldn't find the quality that we were looking for. So, that's when we started working with knit factories really across the world. I mean, we were working, we were trying to develop the fabric with factories in Italy, Los Angeles, Romania, and, you know, working to develop this stitch that, you know, wouldn't bag out at the knees and wouldn't slide off the hips, you know, in terms of the pants and really perform well throughout the day. You know, of course, there's, there's the proof is in the pudding. I mean, when you look at brands like Alaya that have been built, you know, Air Vellige, brands that have been built entirely on stretch knits, we know that this is a concept that women have loved and worn and felt good in for decades. But there wasn't really anybody doing this in sort of a separate sportswear way. How'd you come up with the name? Such a good name. Thank you. Well, my mother told me that the name should describe exactly what the product is. And so, you know, we did play with a few different names. And high sport to me really defined exactly what I see the collection to be, which is, you know, high represents the fact that it's elevated, that it's elegant, that it's ultra luxe, and, you know, it's sporty. So I think you can attest to this, I'm sure, but, you know, I think women wear these pants all day long and run around in them. And the modern woman is incredibly busy. And so I think that's the sport element. It feels it really, to me, is a throwback to that idea of true American sportswear, where people talk about sportswear now being athletic. Yes. Whereas sportswear in the 70s was sportswear. It was like what women wore every single day. It was the clothing that you wore to the office or what have you. And it's very American. The first time I ever saw a pair of high sport pants was probably on Leandra Medine, another friend of Max Stein. Max Stein is a person who every single person in my entire life is connected to. So another friend of Max Stein, I think she wore your violet pair. That's right. On her Instagram. And they looked amazing. And then I get an email from Nicole Carey, who is a marketing person who you work with, who sends me this look book. And I just thought, oh my God, this brand is amazing. The art direction, the photography, and these pants are insane. They're going to be a huge, huge hit. I knew immediately. I was working on a story about wholesale, essentially, about department stores. People, I think it was called searching for the next Barneys. It was about how people miss going to department stores and there aren't many. And I figured out a way to use you as the lead because you started with only doing wholesale. You weren't doing direct to consumer, which at the time, this is in what, 2021? At the time, it was very common for people to start with direct to consumer and then move into wholesale and you started with wholesale. And can you talk a bit about why you did decide to launch in wholesale rather than start with direct to consumer and do, I know doing direct to consumer costs a lot more money because you have to pay for all the product upfront and you also have to make the bet yourself on how much product you should buy. But there are other ways to do it. You could have done pre-order. Why did you go the wholesale route? We decided to launch with wholesale for a few reasons. I would say that the first reason was that we wanted to invest all of the time and resources that we were investing in the launch of high sport into the product. So everything that we invested went directly into the development and the perfection of the product rather than a direct consumer business that might invest in marketing and inventory and store build out or e-commerce develop development. We really were focused on the product. The other thing I would say is that it was important to me that we receive sort of the validation from some of the best boutiques in America that this was a product that would resonate with their customers and could sit among the other brands that they carried. So, for example, we launched with a store in Newport Beach called Omerees that I know you're familiar with, Just One Eye in Los Angeles and New Auge in Aspen. And those are still three of our most important stores and they're three of the best stores in the world. And so when those buyers or store owners came in and said that they actually I went into their stores with the product on my, you know, in garment bags hanging over my back. But when I went into those stores and showed them the product and they said that, you know, in fact, not only did they like it for their customer, but that it would hang well in and among the brands that they carry. That was sort of the validation that I was looking for that we were onto something. What did you learn from your previous gigs about those independent stores? Because you specifically chose the thing about this product, and I'm sure pretty much everyone who's listening to this has seen these pants or tried them on. You know immediately that they're amazing. And I have no doubt that if you had gone into some of the bigger multi-brand department stores that first season, you would have gotten one of them probably just because they are so good that someone would have taken the risk on you, especially because you have a good reputation in the business. But you went with these independent individual stores that have really, really devoted customers. Is that why you decided to go that route? Like why did you choose the independence versus really volling or versus really advocating to get into one of the majors? When these buyers, you know, when the buyers from these boutiques come into my showroom, they're shopping for their individual customers. So they know their customers well. They know who's coming into their store and what they're buying. And they are the ones that are selling to their customers. So I knew that if I could get the buyers, the store owners, and therefore the salespeople at these boutiques on our side and really promoting the product for us and selling directly to the customer, that that was going to be our best conduit and our most trustworthy conduit to the end consumer. It's a very prudent way to do it. But it's also challenging because the thing is like most brands, it just out of the gate are not going to have a product that is so obviously good. But I guess moving on from that, what was the response like to start? Like, did you expect it? I know everything sold out really quickly, but what were those first few months like when the product finally started to land in stores? Well, by the way, just to back up for one second, I think that the stores that came into my showroom, that first couple of seasons or few seasons that bought it, one, you know, those boutiques have flexibility and they have vision. And so these were, you know, people who came in and said, this looks really cool. It looks like something unlike anything I've seen or I'm seeing on the market today. And I can take a chance on a small brand. I think larger stores and a lot of the, you know, certainly the department stores and some of the pure play e-commerce stores really don't have the flexibility to make those decisions or to make, you know, a small order to trial a brand. And so that was another reason to go with these boutiques. All of the reasons in the world. I am grateful to those boutiques for putting us in business. And like I said, they're as important to us today as they were three years ago, if not more. Meanwhile, this wholesale model is actually, I think, what we have to thank for creating a lot of the very early buzz and excitement around high sport. And I say that because whereas as you said, so many brands were an R direct consumer, by being 100% wholesale, we really created friction between the customer and the product. And it wasn't intentional by any means, but the fact that, you know, we started to post this compelling imagery to Instagram and, you know, people started paying attention to that and, you know, engaging with that and, you know, started to find the pants and try the pants and tell their friends about them, created this kind of groundswell. And yet it was actually quite difficult to buy the pants because they were cut to order. They were sold at this point at about five boutiques internationally. So, you know, I think that friction, the fact that you couldn't click to buy, is what really created this demand with the customer. So that's another reason why this proved to be a good launchpad for us. Friction can be a good thing. Here it was. But it's a Goldilocks thing. It's a thing of, it's either you don't want too much friction, but no friction doesn't create any, friction can create desire and a little tension is good. But there's definitely a balance between people start to get a little annoyed versus, you know, they're just wanting it so badly. Well, and I think that became obvious quickly. We wanted to, I of course, liked the excitement and the enthusiasm that was in part created by this, you know, pent up or sort of like choked demand. But also we didn't want to frustrate the customer. So the reality was we wanted to get them the pants. And if there was a demand for the pants or is a demand for the pants, we very much want to be able to meet that because that's the business, of course. So, you know, I mean, we are still 100% wholesale today, and we are still cut to order. So the amount of pants or jackets or tops or sweaters that we make are a direct reflection of the number of these items that our stores buy. But now, of course, there are more stores. We are extremely tight with our distribution or selected with our distribution. But there are more stores and there are more pants readily available and more of everything readily available. But it's still cut to order. So, you know, I think there's less, there's more availability, but we've still tried to keep we've tried to keep a the reins tight.

From the beginning, these pants, there was like almost a mythology around them. And one of the things about them is they are what, $860 or in the vicinity of $900. I don't know how you're pricing them exactly right now. Our classic pool plan is $860. That's right. $860, I got it right. So $860 for a pair of pants. We just did a podcast on pricing with Elizabeth Vondergold. It's actually not that much money. There are pants that are $2,000, $2,500, etc., etc., that are probably made with cheaper fabric than what you're making. But there was a sort of conversation around the pant being expensive, maybe because they're stretchy. And so it's like, am I paying $860 for a pair of leggings? That's that sort of thing. I have vehemently defended the pants and the price. But what was your reaction when you started hearing that chatter? It obviously didn't matter at retail. People were buying them like they cost $25. So it's not like there was any price resistance in the store. But there was this chatter that you obviously were aware of. What did you think about it? And why do you think, as someone who has spent a lot of her career pricing things, why do you think people made a thing of it? Well, first of all, I want to acknowledge that high sport is expensive. And I know that that prices people out of the collection. And I do think that that's a bummer. And I'm very well aware of that. But the reality is, and I listened to you explore this with EVG on your podcast, well made clothes are expensive. They are incredibly expensive to make. And if you are thoughtful about the materials that you're using and the factories that you're working with, and the way that you're bringing them into the country and how you are packaging them, even without being excessive clothes, well made clothes are expensive to produce and to sell. And so I think that the price is very much a direct reflection of that. Now, as to why there was or is so much conversation about the price, I think partially it's due to the fact that the pants that we're talking about specifically are a pull on stretch pan. Of course, you and I know this is part of the reason that they're so special. But I think a lot of people think of the more expensive clothing as being occasion wear. And I would argue that maybe we should be making this investment if we are buying clothes at this price point, then maybe we should be making this investment in the clothes that we wear every day. And so I also think that high sport is quite versatile. And as I said before, translate so well day to night that I happen to think they're a good investment for this reason. I also think that our early, you know, the early buzz that was generated probably largely by Instagram and by a little bit of press that we were able to garner sort of attracted the attention of the aspirational customer. I think this might have also come from Moda Operandi in part two. And the aspirational customer, you know, might be more price sensitive, let's say, than some of the other designer shoppers. Maybe they are used to spending exorbitant sums on handbags or shoes, but not on something like a pair of pants. And so I think that, you know, of course, we are thrilled to capture an aspirational customer. But I think maybe that's part of the reason that there was this chatter. But of course, you know, don't forget that I grew up at the row and I remember, you know, the $5,000 alligator backpack and the backlash that that inspired. So I, this is old hat to me. Yeah. And again, it does all kind of give a little bit of mythology around this brand that you, it's interesting because the the pants I've for for fashion industry people and close followers of fashion, the pants are known, you could just call them the pants and people would know what they are. And, you know, I got a pair as quickly as I could. And you wear them so much that it does feel like they're worth the money. But I have a lot of friends that don't work in the industry, but who buy fashion and they don't buy crazy expensive stuff, but they bought them for the same reason, because they knew they would wear them a lot. And that's the most important thing. But one of these things around the price around the, they were worn by all the sort of cool fashion, insidery influencers like Leandra Medine, like Becky Malinski, who wrote about them at the Wall Street Journal when she was working there, but then wrote about them again when she launched her now famous sub stack. I think Becky's going to come on in a couple of weeks and talk to the business of newsletters, which will be fun. But I wonder also you yourself did not do a ton of press. Like I interviewed you for that Barney story, and I know you had done a couple other things, but there hasn't been a profile on you and who you are. And is that intentional? Why have you decided to not do that much press? Because it really has kind of also created a little bit of mystery around the brand, because the pants are so known, but you are, it's not like you're out at events three nights a week, getting your picture taken or whatever. I mean, you do go out, but not, you know what I mean? Like you're not, you're not pushing yourself the way a lot of other designers do understandably. I think that's attributable to a few things. One, it's very much intentional. I mean, it's also intentional that my name is not on the door, you know, that this is called high sport. I want the product to stand for itself and I want the product to be the focus. And then after that, I want the brand to be the focus. And I want that to be where the attention is going. And that's where I put my attention. So, you know, not seeking press comes naturally to me and seems to be in my mind the best thing for the business.

So one more point of friction that I would like to talk to you about and then we can talk about just fun stuff, but the dupes thing. So there are a lot of high sport dupes. I was at an event yesterday talking to one of our mutual friends and she had on a pair of the dupes and she said, I'm getting I just ordered from a list. I ordered a real pair and honestly the dupes, I mean, she looked great. She has amazing style, but they, I mean, you, they want it's not even a can't even compare. They, it's so obvious that they're not high sport, but the silhouette is similar. They're trying from everyone from Everlane all the way up to brands that you compete with. There was a runway show in Europe that I think I might have texted you from it. I don't really want to call them out. I'm a huge fan of this company and also it just doesn't, it feels like no reason to, to be mean girl right now, but they did a pair on their runway and so many of your competitors have come out with similar styles in, in stretchy nits, sometimes just the similar silhouette, but you, there are, there are a lot of copies of what you're doing with the pant in particular. So to me, it's kind of like, I think about it the way you think about canal street knockoffs and I don't think that that actually is probably isn't cannibalizing your sales at any sales, if, if any a tiny bit, but I doubt it. If anything, it creates more excitement around what you're doing and, and builds up, oh, these are the, these are the high sport pant knockoffs. These are the, and it's, it's sort of burnishing your brand. And the other thing is as someone who there was this one knit turtleneck sweater that Celine that Phoebe Filo did at Celine, it was chunky. It's like one of those like techie knits, ket and techie cashmere that she did and it was quite expensive. And for years, I tried to, it was a turtleneck chunky with a uneven hem. I, for years, I tried to find a copy of it and I would spend, you know, a couple hundred bucks here and there on these cashmere sweaters or, or wool blend mix to try to give me the feeling of the Phoebe Filo sweater. And in the end, I just bought the Phoebe Filo sweater. And you know, I don't own any of those knockoffs that I bought. I just still own the Phoebe Filo sweater. I think that's the lesson from my perspective. But as the person putting this stuff out and you go to any mall and you see like 15 different copies of it at every price point, how have you sort of managed that mentally and also within the business? Well, in terms of managing it mentally, I love the dupes. I think the dupes, first of all, the dupes make me laugh. So every time I see a fresh dup, I get a kick out of it. I think you're right. You know, I really think for the most part, the dupes are talking to another customer. And if somebody is tempted to try a dupe, as you said, they'll quickly discover that it's not, in fact, a dupe at all. It's extremely difficult to replicate what we've created with HighSport. But I think they drive the conversation. And, you know, I hope every time you see a HighSport dupe, you think of HighSport. And, and they do us a service in that way. But also, you know, you know, more than that, I think the dupes reflect the success of the idea, which is this, this, you know, in this case, a sporty and versatile silhouette that women want to wear. I think, you know, women have been attracted to the color that we've offered them. And so I know that some of these brands are trying to duplicate that and some of the colors specifically. But to me, it is, it's flattering and it's a reflection of the idea, you know, the success of the idea that we've created. You can build a business off of one product. They love to call it the hero product. But you don't seem to want to, you want to do more and you have done more. I mean, the collection is a complete collection with tops, bottoms, dresses. I went and did a personal order last season with a couple of our friends and I got a dress for the first time, which was very exciting. But what, what has the product mix right now versus when you started, whereas, where I'm sure the pants were like really driving all of it, how has the, the demand changed over the last couple of years that you've been doing this? How do you want the assortment to look? I'm incredibly grateful for the, for the attention that the pants have gotten. And I did not anticipate that they would be a hero product or the hero product. You know, that is what sort of resonated with the consumer right out of the gate. And I think that that's because the pants are emblematic of the greater concept. And the greater concept is these easy to wear, easy to style items that, you know, are super wearable, super functional, elegant and elevated and all the things that I've mentioned. And I think the pants are really emblematic of that. And, you know, that's why they've been successful or maybe stood out. But, you know, as you said, we've developed a wardrobe around the pants. And we find that a lot of women want to buy into a full look. We hear this from our stores and we see this in, you know, a lot of the selling that we, that we are able to review. I think, you know, women want a full look because they don't want to style themselves because it's, it's easier for them. And, you know, we're all looking for sort of hacks. And I think these pants are meant to make women's lives easier. And so we've offered sweaters and tops, you know, and other things that work back well to the pants. And we continue to design into this wardrobe, you know, this modular wardrobe concept. So, you know, one, we are continuing to build out the war world of the pants. So we have, of course, our classic crop pants, but we also offer a straight leg pan and a tapered pan and a longer pan and soon a shorter pan. And so, you know, we're able to serve a lot of women that way. And then we offer things that are in service to the pants like cotton the sweaters, which have been hugely popular for us and various top styles. We have a jacket that the women have really responded to and loved. And so, you know, we are continuing to, like I said, not only build out the world of the pants, but the items around it that that she can wear back to them. And the pants have afforded us the opportunity to do that in a way by having this hero product and really driving the business with the pants, we're able to continue to experiment and innovate and explore new styles and new categories and, you know, figure out really follow the customer, figure out what's resonating with her and what she likes and then follow her lead. What do you want to do with the business? Are you going to, one minor question is, well, not minor, but one thing that I'm always curious about is are you going to ever launch woven, which for the uninitiated, that just means like a shirt made of cotton that's not a stretch, that's not a knit. Like, do you have ambition to get into woven's or do you think you're going to stick with knits and then more broadly, like what is your plan in terms of scale? Do you want to be big? Do you want to ramp it up? Are you going to do DTC? That's 50 questions in one. But basically, I want to know your entire life plan from now to for the next 10 years. I don't have any, we don't have any intention to go to woven's. And that's because we want to be an expert in what we're doing. So what we are making, we want to be the go-to resource for, you know, women's knitwear, you know, and I think in this case, stretch with knitwear, so much of not everything that we make is stretch, but so much of what we make is stretch and that's what gives it its function for the most part. I think, you know, we want to be known as the resource for knitwear. And so that's where all of our focus is. And I think, first of all, there's so many people doing woven's and doing woven's really well. And I shop those brands and wear them. And, you know, I think that we're better off being experts. I also think there's a little bit of an growing inclination to shop a little bit more niche for the customer. And so by focusing what we're doing, I think that's going to give us the best ability to become experts, to serve our customer. Alyssa, you did a great job. Thank you for being here.
