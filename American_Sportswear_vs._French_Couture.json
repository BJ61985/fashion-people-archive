Happy Friday. I hope you're enjoying the last Dregs of Summer. I'm officially back from my vacation. Send tips, people. But my break was really nice. I'm a big proponent of doing vacations in places you've been many times before, and that's what we did, and I had a great time. On Line Sheet on Thursday, I have a conversation with Kate Young who was helping out all week first on Fashion People, then on Line Sheet. You talk about sort of the state of fashion, and it in some ways relates to this interview I did with Nancy. You wrote this book about the history of American fashion, and I think if you read that and then listen to our conversation or listen to Nancy and my conversation and read my conversation with Kate, they go hand in hand. I have also been keeping a close eye on the Democratic National Convention, which is over now because this is officially Friday when you'll be hearing this Friday or later. I am recording this on Thursday morning, so I don't know if Kate Young's Taylor Swift prediction turned out right, but we'll see. I hear hoping it did for everyone involved. Next week I'll have some updates on Line Sheet on the situation at Sacks. It sounds like FTC is going to approve the deal, and Sacks also apologized for late payments. I will have a little more on that when I get back to things, and also maybe a little more on Kamala Harris's fashion choices and how she is making them. That's what I'm going to say for now. I'm really excited to share this interview with Nancy. This book is great. I suggest you read it. We really think of the US as this place that fashion started as a shop and copy situation where they would go to Europe, they would go to the Couture Shows, buy a Couture look, come back, copy it, and put on the label TK brand for Neiman Marcus or Scaperrally for Bergdorf Goodman or what have you. That did happen for a really long time. I think up and through the 70s. But there were also people here making great clothes. Claire McCartle is the biggest name from the early days, like 30s, 40s, 50s of American fashion. There were others, and Nancy wrote about them. She also wrote a lot about the influence of fashion media during that time. I think a lot of you I know work in magazines or work in magazines. I think you'll find that interesting as well. We also talk about the state of American fashion today. So I hope you enjoy it. Nancy McDonough, welcome to Fashion People. Oh, thank you so much, Lauren. It's such an honor to be here. So happy to have you. So first off, would you have for breakfast? I knew this was coming. Okay. This morning I had toast. It was a cranberry pecan bread, I believe. And I had it with butter. I'm particular about my butter. I don't like sweet butter. I prefer powdered butter. And I had some tea. Yorkshire Gold. That sounds delicious. It was good. That's a first for our guests. Yes, I like it. The tea, I like the toasted bread. The cranberry sounds really delicious. So Nancy, to start, tell me a little bit about yourself and how you got to this point in life. Okay. Well, as you know, I'm a fashion journalist and I'm also a fashion historian. I started out in magazine, you know, back when dinosaurs roamed the earth in the 90s. And I've always enjoyed writing about fashion more like a cultural anthropologist than just about, you know, skirt should be this long or whatever it is. So I, although I continue to do fashion journalism, I'm also a fashion historian. And I actually got a graduate degree in that. So those two things really came together in writing this book, I would say. When did you go back to school to be, like, how far in your career did you decide to get the graduate degree? Pretty far. I already had a graduate degree, which I got in my 20s when most people do that. And then when I was in my 30s, it just seemed like, you know, magazines were cratering. Fashion journalism, you know, it just didn't have the same opportunities that it did back in the 90s when I thought I'd work in magazines forever and that by now I'd be, you know, a managing editor or something like that. What magazines did you work for? The one I had the longest association with was Nylon. I loved working at Nylon. I remember your name on that masthead. Uh-huh. That was really fun. That was in the early 2000s. Yeah, I was there for about three years. And then I left Nylon because I met my husband. He's Scottish. We were living in London. So we lived in London for a few years where I was freelancing. And then when we came back to New York, I worked for Style.com. And I was at Style.com until my daughter was born, which was 2008. Then being a freelancer ever since. And you wrote a book during that time period as well, correct? I, yeah, I've written a few. The last one I wrote before this was a book about Lily Pulitzer, which was for Aisuline. Oh, yeah. I also wrote the shoe book, which is a history of shoes. The first book I wrote was called The Classic 10, and the true story is a little black dress and nine other fashion favorites. So you may be thinking of that one. That's the one I'm thinking of because I remember Style.com really, I feel like they did a lot of promotion around it too. I think that was actually before I was at Style.com. Um, they might have done something, but I wasn't working there at the time. Yeah. I just remember the cover very distinctly. So what, your in magazines, you can tell that like, this is going the way people had thought it would go. But why did you decide to do, like most people in your position went and worked at brands, or became CMOs or marketers? Why did you decide to become a fashion historian? Like, what did you think the value in that was? Other than obviously your curious person who wants to know about the stuff. Yeah. You know, before I went into journalism, I thought about becoming an academic, which I ultimately didn't do because I didn't want to have to go teach, you know, art history at the University of Saskatchewan or something. I wanted to have a little bit more control over my life. But I always had that interest in, uh, in academia, in scholarship, and I don't really have a business brain. So we're going to work for a brand wasn't, um, wasn't the obvious choice for me. Although I completely understand why it is for many people. It just wasn't, I just, I didn't feel like that's where I would do my best work. Um, so I decided to dig deeper into what did interest me. And I've always loved fashion and I've also always been interested in, um, fashions of the past. I am a very annoying person to watch like a costume drama with because I'll, you know, I'll say things like, well, skirts weren't that length in 1929. You should, you know how you could make some money? Cause I'm always thinking about consulting, consulting on some of these shows. I would love to do that. I would love to do that. Everybody in the entertainment community who's a showrunner, Nancy is available to consult on your, to ensure that your costumes are era appropriate. Absolutely. How if we meet? I can't even remember. Well, before I met you, people kept telling me you've got to meet Lauren because you would get on so well. You guys are alike. You have the same interest. I think we met at a dinner where we seated next to each other. Maybe. And then we would just have coffee. We would have coffee. Talk about the state of the fashion world. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Well, I am, I'm so glad that we're reconnecting for this book. Me too. Which I think is so, the idea of sportswear in particular has come up a lot for me in my reporting and conversations recently. And also Willie Smith randomly has been coming up a lot. Um, I met the guy who did Mark, who did the Bill Cunningham documentary, who also did a book about Willie Smith. And so it's just like he's in the ether. But anyway, that is kind of fast forwarding many years after your, your book starts off. But let's, let's talk about Empress, Empresses of 7th Avenue. And what was the impetus for this specifically? Like, what were you trying to capture? Why did you decide to write this book? Well, um, I think like most journalists, I have a contrarian streak. Um, you can probably relate to that. You know, if someone tells me that something is like this, I think, is it really? We should look into that. Um, so this idea that is still very strong in fashion, that the French are just better at fashion because they're French. Um, all I was, it just, I thought, no, there's something more there. Uh, you know, there was nothing preordained about this. It was actually very carefully planned by Louis XIV. So I went back to the 17th century and his first minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who really turned France into the world's first global luxury brand. And so your book sort of explains what happened when the Americans got involved. And I think like the biggest misnomer in fashion in the industry is that ready to wear sort of came to be in the seventies, like Saint Laurent created ready to wear. But the reality is ready to wear has existed long before then. You focused on American fashion and specifically American fashion cut almost coming of age in the thirties and forties. What drove you to, to write about that era and what did you learn about France versus America, et cetera? American fashion existed before the thirties and forties, but American designers had no name recognition. They were, uh, backroom employees. Their names were not on the label. And even the, uh, manufacturers that they worked for, their names weren't on the label. A department store would buy a dress and they would put their own label in it. So if you shopped at Best in Company or Lord and Taylor, it didn't know who designed your dress. It just had their label in it. And the other thing that was holding American designers back was that they were expected to copy Paris designers, um, which everyone did. Paris was the world global capital of fashion and there was not another city. New York was a manufacturing center. Um, so there was a very elaborate system in place whereby American editors, American buyers, American designers would travel to Paris about four times a year. Uh, they would buy models, which they would take back and they would copy. But the key difference in French fashion and American fashion is that the couturiers were making couture. This was, it's not like today where you go into a store and you buy, you know, a balance, a gut or a Gucci or whatever it is and you walk out with it 20 minutes later. This was made to order clothing. Uh, you would, if an American department store, let's say Bergdorf Goodman bought a Chanel dress, they would bring it back. If you wanted to buy that dress, it was made for you in the Bergdorf Goodman work rooms, you would go in, you would have a minimum of four fittings, three fittings, excuse me. Uh, and it would take a few weeks for it to get to you. So this was fashion for these few American designers created ready to wear, uh, fashion for everybody. No fittings, you go in and buy it. It has a much more democratic nature to it. Um, and it really didn't make any sense to copy couture clothes for the ready to wear market because they're two very different things. Um, so I wanted to show that American fashion actually has a very rich history of its own. Uh, it's completely entwined with French fashion. They're, they're interdependent, but it's different. It's worthy of study and people in the industry should know, you know, where our, where our industry came from and appreciate it. So when did ready to wear actually start to proliferate in America? Because, you know, even in, you think of the early 1900s or the late 1800s, and you think of someone going to a dressmaker or a general store or whatever, buying a bolt of fabric and having a dressmaker make the dress, when did it kind of switch over to having ready made stuff in the stores? Well, we see ready made things already by the end of the 19th century, um, certainly in the United States. Um, so you could go in and buy, um, what, like a jacket and skirt, uh, which became one. Women started really entering the workforce in the 1890s. Um, you could buy a shirt waist, which was the name for a blouse. You could buy a jacket. You could buy a skirt. And this was ready to wear fashion. Um, so the American industry became quite robust early on by contrast in other countries, like in France or in England, the ready to wear industry was not nearly as good. Um, so there were a lot more dressmakers. Um, and there was, it's not that there wasn't ready to wear. It's just that the ready to wear industry in the United States was really good. Um, and it was established early on. Um, and it became excellent at turning out clothes that good clothes, nice clothes, beautiful clothes that all women could have access to. So this was like by the 1920s, when the garment in a district is founded in New York. It's a well oiled machine, the American ready to wear industry.

So I would say that the sort of idea in the fashion industry is that well into the 40s and 50s, what you are describing of the editors and buyers go to the Couture shows in Paris. They buy one sample, one, one sample of a few items, or they sketch it out themselves. They go back and they do these ready made pieces that say Chanel for Bergdorf Goodman or Karl. I have a jacket that says Karl Lagerfeld for Neiman Marcus or something like that. That is the sort of perception of what everybody was buying. But that's not the case. There was tons of sort of off the rack availability and there were real designers designing these clothes. What flipped the switch when you start to get into the Claire McCartle, the real names of people? Like again, if you think of general fashion industry myths, you think of American fashion starting with like Oscar de la Renta and Willie Smith and all those, Calvin and Halston in the 60s and 70s, whereas there was Claire McCartle, there was Bonnie Taschen. There were designers that were Elizabeth Haas, who I think is also very well known at this point in fashion circles as a fashion journalist. But when did it sort of, you mentioned Haas and McCartle pretty early in the book, what happened to flip the switch that they became known quantities and how known were they to consumers? The movement really started, I mean, there had been an American fashion for American women movement almost as long as there's been American fashion. There was a whole campaign that was done by the Ladies' Home Journal in the early 20th century, which tried to suggest that French designers didn't really know how to dress American designers. American women should be patriotic and buy American fashion. But this really took off, I'd say in the 1930s. Elizabeth Haas, who you mentioned, was an amazing designer, a very, very interesting person. She went to Paris in the 1920s because she believed in what she called the French legend. The French legend is that all beautiful clothes are made in the atelier of French designers and all women want them. So she wanted to be a couturier, so she went to Paris to learn to become one. And while she was there, she became completely disillusioned with the whole system. She thought that French couturiers were only interested in dressing a very small number of women who devoted their entire lives to being chic in a way that we just can't appreciate today. These were women who had, they didn't work, they had unlimited funds, they had ladies' maids. Really, their whole lives were directed towards going to fittings, wearing the right clothes and the right places with the right people. She thought this was really boring. She had no interest in that. She wanted to dress American women. So she came back to the United States, she opened a couture salon, and I want to stress she was making couture. She was not making ready to wear. But she became America's first star designer. She was a well-known name, she appeared in ads. She was interviewed a lot. People knew her name. But then she closed down her couture house when World War II started. And she really sank into oblivion, partly because, as well as being a fashion designer, she became a labor organizer and she got blacklisted by the FBI. So that really ended her career. On the ready to wear side, Clara McCartle is really the first star designer to come out of Seventh Avenue, which was at the time the center of the American fashion industry. She started working in the early 1930s. She worked for a brand called Townley-Frox. And she created this dress called the monastic dress. And it solved one of the problems that American fashion had, which was because it was ready to wear. They had fit issues. When you're making a couture, you sit each dress to each client. When you're making ready to wear, you're cutting hundreds or even thousands of dresses at a time. What she did was cut this dress on the bias, like her idol, Madeline D'Aunay. And then you just wore a belt and it conformed to the body. It flattered many, many different figures. The dress was so successful that it was knocked off endlessly. And Townley-Frox went out of business. But they started up again after the war started. And it was really World War II that put American designers front and center. Because when the Nazis occupied Paris, it was like they could have bell jar over the city. They had total control of any information that came in or went out. So American fashion, which had been completely reliant on getting these French clothes, French models to copy, suddenly the source was cut off. They were left to their own devices. To some people in the industry, this was like catastrophic. If you look at WWD from that time, there are people saying things like, I don't know what we're going to do. One man was trying to reassure people saying, well, we've got at least six months' worth of French fashion, so we can copy for that amount of time and then we'll figure it out. Tharmacartle was never interested in copying. She wanted to do her own thing. She didn't think that clothes for women should be uncomfortable or impractical. She thought that form and function could exist in the same garment. And she got really lucky when Townley-Frox reopened. She was hired back as the designer by someone who really trusted her and let her do her own thing. Didn't try to make her copy Paris. Didn't try to interfere in the design at all. And women really responded to this. She became the first ready-to-wear star. And has inspired so many designers since most recently, Tori Birch, who blurbed your book. So what was the look, the American look during that period? How would you say it was different from the France couture? Because we're not even talking about what regular people in France were wearing. We're talking about what only really wealthy women were wearing. Now today, what wealthy people wear and what not wealthy people wear is pretty similar. But at the time, what was the American look that Tharmacartle and Haas and all these designers, even the lesser-known ones, were sort of fashioning? I think before we get into that, we should talk about context as well. The clothes that were coming out of Paris were really pretty formal. This was a time when fashion had a lot of rules. I see people, they're referencing photos of like Slim Keith wearing shorts and little thong sandals and a sleeveless top. And today we think, great, I'll wear that to the office. That's not where she was wearing it. This was not city clothing. She was wearing it if she was at the beach or in the suburbs. You just would not wear that sort of stuff on a city street. Sportswear, which was what American fashion became, was a more casual form of dressing. It's what you would wear if you were participating in sports, if you were going to go skiing or playing tennis, playing golf, but also what you might wear to be a spectator for these sorts of sports. The revolutionary thing that American designers did was to say, we can wear this stuff during the day. It doesn't need to be for these particular activities. There's no reason why the clothes that women wear all the time can't be more casual and more comfortable and more suited to American lifestyles. And that is exactly what athletic leisure is as well. It is. It predicted a lot of this. Like Clara McCartle was making leggings in the 1940s. People didn't understand them. They appeared in life and they had some sort of caption like strange looking clothes for college students or something. They turned out to be too expensive to manufacture. But you know, she was creating the athleisure of her time. This show is brought to you by Boca. Boca knows that when you take care of your mouth, your whole body benefits.

The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th. Follow and listen on Apple Podcasts, the Odyssey app, Spotify or wherever you get your podcast. So while all of this is happening, you also have the fashion media landscape, which is a big part of this book as well. It's not just about the designers. It's also about how important and integral role the media played. And you have full chapters on certain editors and what would you say the media's role was at that time, especially compared to what it is now. I think when people think of fashion history, they think of designers and designers creating this look. But designers didn't work in a vacuum and that look would never have reached people without fashion media helping, magazines, newspapers. There was no way to go directly to your consumer at the time of the way people can do now. They can completely control their message via social media. That didn't exist at the time. Women looked to magazines like Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, also to their, you know, the women's page of their local newspaper, which covered fashion. So Vogue and Harper's Bazaar were the twin Bibles of American fashion. And their editors and chiefs, the editor and chief of Vogue at this time was a woman named Edna Woolman Chase, who had an incredibly long career at Vogue. I think she started there in something like 1894 when she was a teenager working in the mailroom. She became editor-in-chief in 1914 and then she retired in 1952. She was there for a really long time. Carmel Snow, who was the editor-in-chief of Harper's Bazaar, actually used to work for Vogue. She worked for Edna Woolman Chase. She had been promised or promised between, you know, between the lines, the job of editor-in-chief. She realized that Edna Woolman Chase was never going to leave this job, so she defected and went to Harper's Bazaar, which at the time was a really big deal because they had this kind of Hatfield and McCoy relationship. There was a lot of rivalry between the two magazines. And when Carmel Snow left, the staff at Vogue was instructed to never speak to her again, and they didn't. But this was where women went for all of their fashion information. And they could really create trends. They could promote designers. They had a very cozy relationship. But they were not really... You can't think of the other stories we see today, like, you know, this is what Balanced Out This Country House looks like or whatever it is. It was just about the clothes. Designers were not celebrities at the time. But it was where you would go to see this is what's happening for this season. These are the looks that you should invest in. And they really speak in the imperative voice. They tell you, this is what you have to do. They had an incredible amount of authority. I was just going to say the authority thing is very interesting because it really has... It is really gone from traditional fashion magazines. Sometimes you see it in The Gentlewoman. They do really fun items about how to wear something. I feel like I don't think I wrote this. I did like one or two things for them at some point, but they did one on how to wear pearls or something. Like, maybe I did write it. I can't remember. But you don't really see that anymore in the fashion magazines. There's no like, you should do this and all those Deanna Riellen here are her quotes of what... I have the book of her quotes somewhere back there. Why don't you call them? Yeah. It doesn't really exist anymore. What do you think happened changing? And that is, I would say, the last... I mean, maybe it's the last 30 years. Do you think that that is really driven by Anna Wintour and her way of being an editor? Like, what do you think shifted in the culture that there is less of that recommendation part of it? I think our relationship to fashion really changed. Fashion has become part of popular culture. It's entertainment now. Back in the era that I'm talking about, fashion was like this closed conversation between a more elite group of people, the designers and really each other. I think I quote Deanna Rieland in the book when she says, when I was a young woman, very few people even breathed the pantry air of a woman who appeared in Vogue, meaning that even when in an era when every middle class person had a servant, very few people even worked for the type of women who appeared in Vogue. Fashion has become part of popular culture. And even though it's much more present and everywhere, it's been devalued. We don't have the kind of respect we used to have for it. We think of fashion now as disposable. People wear things once and then they sell it. There's fast fashion. So as fashion became more part of people's lives, it became so common that people didn't have the respect they used to have for it. Fashion became much more casual. We became much more interested in getting deals. I talk about prices in the book, like a Clare McCartle dress that sold for $30. It's not $30 in today's money. This was like a $630 dress. People bought fewer clothes. They took care of them. They had more respect for them. So as we became more casual, as fashion became more part of popular culture, it just didn't become something that we invested as much time and interest in. I think that has a lot to do with it. How much do you think what transpired here in the 30s, 40s, 50s influenced the rise of ready to wear in the 60s and 70s in Europe? Because it kind of reminds me of, have you ever read the book Amitura? I haven't. It's good. You should definitely read it and you would love David. He is of your ill. He could talk about this stuff forever. And I'm sure if he hasn't read your book yet and has a copy, he'll buy one as soon as it comes out. He would love it. But he's written a lot. His name is David Marks. And he's written a lot about, his most recent book was called Status and Culture. And it was just about what we buy to convey status. But his first book was about, it's called Amitura. And it's about the 1950s in Japan co-opting American preppy style and then America then taking it back. So the perfect example are Cone Denim, Raw Denim Jeans. It's that type of thing. So it's almost like a boomerang in that way. How influenced were the Europeans by what was happening in ready to wear and sportswear in the US at that time? Because this is also the time when the US was, I don't want to say at its peak of influence, but really came into its influence in terms of global culture. Absolutely. Postwar. I think the Europeans were hugely influenced by American ready to wear, especially the Italian fashion industry, which was based on ready to wear. The Marshall Plan, which people don't really associate with fashion, but the Marshall Plan, which came after World War II to help reinvigorate the European economy after it had been completely pummeled by the war, it poured money into Italian fashion, which did not really exist in a big way before then. It was like everywhere else. It was small dressmakers copying the couturiers. The Marshall Plan funded Italian fashion, which followed the American model, you know, ready to wear. But the French also became interested in ready to wear because they saw that's where the future of fashion was going. Ode Couture had thousands and thousands of customers after the war. By the early 1970s, it was down to a pretty low number. Now it's negligible. They saw that as society was becoming more casual, as women were becoming more involved in the workforce and more people were interested in fashion, it was all about ready to wear. And it's not that they had never done ready to wear. As I mentioned, Lucien-Ernon had a ready to wear line in the 1930s. It was called Edition. So although everyone thinks it was Saint-Henry who started ready to wear, he didn't. Saint-Henry saw where fashion was going and with Léif Gauches, he was able to really, you know, people think that he took ideas from a couture line and that put them into Léif Gauches. It was actually the other way around. He was able to be more experimental with Léif Gauches and then funnel that into his couture collections. So I own a lot of Réif Gauches, especially mostly blouses, but I have like a couple sets. And I don't think I've ever actually bought a jacket, but I have a lot of the blouses and I have like a skirt, a skirt set. It's very readily available. It is, especially in Paris. So if you go to secondhand shops in Paris, it's everywhere. And it's not, now it's getting much more expensive, but I have blouses. Now if you go to Desert Vintage in New York, they're $700. Oh my God. I have a lot of blouses. It's crazy. But you know what? Good for them. Markets a man if they can do it. Great. But like I've mostly paid like around 200 bucks. I bought one. I bought one in Paris this past time from the 80s, a little older. That was like 275 bucks or something. It's not crazy expensive. And on the real, real, you can really find some good things. But it's very readily available. There was a lot of it compared to like, is it just a matter of timing as well? Like, and I mean, you don't see a lot of Halston at these stores. You don't see a lot of, and maybe that's just what's on trend as well. Like you don't see any Calvin ready to wear. You see a lot of Calvin from the diffusion lines. And then you think of someone like a Claire McCartle who you can see the references in runway shows constantly. But again, it's not something that like you Google it and you can find a ton of stuff. Whereas the Saint Laurent stuff is just really accessible. If you're, I always tell people because now blouses are back. A friend of mine was like, where can I get a good blouse? And I was like, you should just buy Saint Laurent. Vintage. I have so many of them and probably too many as usual. But just curious what you think that is that just a matter of like timing and volume and the combination of the two? Because I think one of the reasons Saint Laurent does get so much credit is because it's still such a visible name. It is. That's a really interesting question. I think it has to do partly with volume. They were making a lot of it. Saint Laurent was very fortunate in having Pierre Belge as his partner. Not all designers have that kind of someone that they can trust who's very good at the business side of things. So they grew that business very well. And it's a name that has remained relevant. I mean, you mentioned Halston, an incredible designer. But they've never been able to get that brand going again. It hasn't been resuscitated the way other old-fashioned names have been. But Saint Laurent has remained relevant even when Saint Laurent was older and just doing the same thing over and over again. It is a beloved French brand. People have a lot of respect and affection for it. So I think that has something to do with it. It's the relevance of the brand. It's the volume of the brand. It's interesting. On that last trip, I bought a Celine blouse from the 70s as well. A Celine blouse from the 70s, like a linen shirt. I'll send you a photo of it. Well, also, the thing is green. It's so good. And then the Saint Laurent blouse. But it's interesting because Celine was not really a well-known name until Michael Courts. Until Bernardino Bada and hired Michael Courts. But really until Phoebe Fila took it over. When you think about these names, the Colston is a valuable one. I remember during one of the potential relaunches, it's owned by a one licensing firm or another at this point and has been relaunched many times. The Vintage Collector seller, Cameron Silver, was involved. I don't know if he still is. But then Ken Downing, I think, was involved. He used to work in Neiman Marcus. But they've never managed to do it. A Bill Blass same thing. And Bill Blass in some ways has the same kind of archive as Saint Laurent. But for some reason, is never... Looking back, you know so much about the histories of these brands. To me, just thinking about it right now, you can't really say, okay, this is the ingredients that are needed to make it work again. To reboot it. Because yes, Dior, yes, Louis Vuitton, yes. And Saint Laurent probably more than any of them had the richest archive to base wardrobe on for decades to come. But then you look at Celine or Jonathan Anderson with Loewe after several attempts with Narciso Rigaes and Stuart Bevers trying to... Do you think that there is any ingredients needed at the base to make it work for revitalization? Or do you think it really has to just do with luck and timing and getting all the right people together? I think it's probably a combination of both. I don't know, although we know Bill Blass, people in the industry know Bill Blass. I don't know if Bill Blass is the kind of name recognition that a Saint Laurent has or now a Celine has. Although he was an incredible designer. He has a great archives. I think also the fact that he was an American designer at the time just didn't get the same kind of respect as French designers did. When he was starting out, he used to tell people socially that he was in advertising because he thought that was more of an acceptable profession to have than to own up to being a fashion designer. So I think that has something to do with it. I also think there is not the American equivalent of an LVMH that can come in and put in the kind of money that you need to launch a fashion brand now or relaunch a fashion brand. I suspect that has a lot to do with it. What do you think about that? Because I've studied that quite closely and covered that and tried to figure out why there has never been an LVMH or a carrying in the U.S. in the same way. For me, what it comes down to, if you really go back to the history that you're writing about, and maybe my opinion now that I've read your book and it's out there and it's something people will be talking about, my opinion may change a little bit. But what I see as the fundamental is the way those companies are operated, they are operated in a very American way, but with a French sort of philosophy that the creativity is what's going to fuel the sales. Everything else they do and that's changing now. They're becoming more like consumer package, goods, businesses, and I think the creativity in some cases is being lost. But generally, it's been about let's hire a really creative person and then the sales will come after. Whereas America thinks about we have to sell something, yes. To me, that's the fundamental reason why it's never worked here on the luxury front. But Curious, you know so much more history than me if you think there's any other reason for it. I think that has a lot to do with it. I also think, which is part of what you've just been talking about, is the French have an incredible amount of respect for fashion. It's very important to French culture. It's entwined with French culture. We don't have that kind of respect for it here. It just doesn't have the same cultural significance. I think that has a lot to do with it. It's not taken as seriously. What do you think Elizabeth Haas would think about the state of fashion right now? Elizabeth Haas, what an interesting person. I think she'd be horrified to be honest. She wrote this book called Fashionist Spinach. It was named for a well-known New Yorker cartoon at the time, which shows a mother and her child sitting at a dinner table and the mother is saying, eat your broccoli, dear. The kid says, I say spinach and I say to hell with it. What she was saying was that fashion is always trying to sell women something they don't really want and disguising it as something else. She had no tolerance for badly made clothes. She had no tolerance for what she thought of as the vagaries of fashion like you bought a perfectly good coat last season and everyone was telling you it's not working this season. She had no time for that. I think she'd be horrified by the shoddiness of a lot of fast fashion, the disrespect that people have for fashion, not investing in it as she thought that you should. I think she might not be happy with the direction that fashion had taken, although she'd be very happy that more people have access to better clothes than they did in the 1930s when she was writing about this. I was just going to say the one thing that I think is good about, and there are many things that are good about how the industry has evolved. I'm not a total defeatist in this manner, but I think even when we were growing up, there were so many times that I wanted a style of clothing and I couldn't access it because you could only get that if you were buying designer clothes or if you were really rich and thin. Now, I feel like it's still obviously not totally fair ground, but I know a lot of really wealthy people who wear Zara because it looks good and is well pretty well made. I think there is more access to more beautiful looking things or stylish things. You could also argue there's nothing, everything's ugly, so whatever. But if you want to, I recently had Jessica Testa on the podcast and we were talking about prom. The options for prom were to go to Macy's or I didn't know anyone who did this, but I knew cool girls wore Betsy Johnson dresses, but I think maybe one person I knew did that. And then other friends of mine bought vintage and there just weren't, and now, and Jess was saying that proms are actually like everybody dresses very casually, but just generally, if you want a cool pretty dress, you can just go on the internet to 50 million places, including Etsy, to find the exact color you want, the exact style and that part of it. In some ways, there's too much choice, but I remember growing up, I was sad a lot. I was like, there's not, the thing I want doesn't exist and I'm being forced to wear this thing that I don't think is good. Then I discovered the J Crew catalog and it's my life because there was no J Crew stores in Pittsburgh when I was, I think they opened one when I was in college or late high school, but so I wonder if in that way she would be excited that people do have more access. But do you think that it feels like almost the pendulum has, if you think about the Battle of Versailles in the 70s, which Robin Gavon wrote a great book about and how the Americans won this battle between American and French designers and blah, blah, blah, but the pendulum has sort of swung back and it feels like all roads lead to Paris again. I mean, I've written that headline many times that because of the consolidation of the luxury industry and luxury and fashion becoming one and the same, which I would argue they weren't previously, that now like New York Fashion Week, which this is going to run probably the week before because that's when your book comes out, is not what it was even 15 years ago when Philip Lim debuted or what have you. And now it feels like the center of the world is once again there because that's where all the money is. And just curious what your thoughts are about the state of American fashion and how it interacts with those European brands. I think as long as we keep believing in the French legend, which we do, that Paris will be in the dominant position that it has. As long as we think this, that will be true. New York fashion, American fashion, it comes and goes. There are times when New York is more important than other times, there are times when London is more important than other times. Paris is really a constant. It's kind of amazing that it's held on to this position for 400 plus years now. I think American fashion needs to trust in what it does well and not try to be European fashion. I do too. I agree. Nancy, I think I leave you with that. I think that's a good way to end the convo. We didn't even get to talk about Eleanor Lambert though. Oh my goodness. How could we leave her out? She was really incredible. She's a whole episode. Yeah. Maybe you can come back and we can just talk about PR. Oh yeah. We can do that. And how that has changed. But thank you for being here. Congratulations on the book. Thank you, Lauren. So you can buy this in stores right now. And please buy it this week so Nancy gets her bestseller chance. Thank you, Lauren. What we're all hoping for. But congratulations on this. It's a real feat. And I think it's one of these books that is going to be read in classrooms. And it's just really important for anyone who works in the fashion industry to understand the context. She said, let's talk about context. And this is what it's all about. Because we all think things sort of happened a certain way. And the reality is they were much more complex and as usual driven by women. Of course. Yeah. Lauren, it's been a full pleasure. Thank you so much. Congrats, Nancy.
