And today with me on the show is the one and only Plum Sykes, fashion writer extraordinaire and author of several novels, including the recently released Wives Like Us. Plum and I talk New York in the 90s, the rise of the executive butler. Yup, they exist. And not to get all deep on you, but we also contemplate what fashion reveals about human nature. Let's get started. Hey everyone, I am still in LA. I know it is amazing. I'm going to be here for a while until I am not. It has been a very busy week over at Puck in Wednesday's line sheet. I offer up some intel on the changes happening at ID. And I also made a little announcement that Becca, the mastermind behind our favorite Instagram account, style.com is being repped by CAA. So Becca is joining me for Tuesday's show. Maybe he'll tell us more about all the money that CAA is making him. Congrats to Becca. I know that you're all jealous and annoyed because you're jealous people. Speaking of fabulous people, my partner, Rachel Sturgats, who covers the beauty industry for us at Puck, I guess this week she got into, I guess you could call it the refreshed rivalry between beauty entrepreneurs slash major celebrities, Hailey Bieber and Selena Gomez. My big takeaway from her story, which is packed with reporting, it's brief, but packed with reporting. The best kind of story is that Rare Beauty is a pretty, that's Selena's brand, is a pretty remarkable company. It is actually one of the top selling brands at Sephora. It might even be the top selling brand. It's vying for the top spot with Charlotte Tilbury. That is really crazy and amazing. I feel like I need to buy some Rare Beauty products. I understand from Rachel that the blush is the thing. So I love blush. I will partake and maybe I'll give you a review in a coming episode. Then yesterday online sheet in my big Thursday issue, I shared some developments of what's happening behind the scenes at LVMH, both in terms of executives and then also designers. There's a lot going on. That story will never end, but it's a big one right now. Then just a reminder that Monday is Memorial Day in the US and a bank holiday in the UK. It's going to be a mailbag issue. I'm not going to leave you high and dry, but I am going to dial it back a bit and just do a mailbag. My big ask of you is please do not send an email out, a press release out at 9 a.m. on Sunday morning announcing that Michael Ryder is officially going to Celine or something. We all know it's true, but I don't need you to do that to me. Please let us have our weekend. You deserve it. We deserve it. It can wait till Tuesday. So that's my big request. But if you do have a question, like a real question for me that you want to see in the mailbag, don't hesitate to DM me on social media or email me at lornepuck.news.com. Or you can call me. My number is plus one, 6462413902. I know people think I'm crazy that I give out my number so much, but this is my job. I need you to call me. Call me anytime. I'm available.

Just go to Puck.News slash fashion people and we'll hook you up. I hope you enjoy this conversation with plum. They always say never meet your heroes. And in most cases, I believe that's true. I will say there have been circumstances over the years where I have met my heroes and they've lived up to expectations. One that comes to mind is the designer Kate Spade. I met her a couple of years before she passed away and honestly, she was awesome. She was as edgy and weird and interesting and cool and stylish as you would have imagined and a great conversationalist and plum psychs. I mean, she needs no introduction, but she definitely exceeded expectations and we just had a great time. We chatted about pretty much everything that I wanted to discuss with her. She's just really cool and I hope that she'll be my friend and I hope you enjoy the conversation. Plum, thank you for being here. Thank you so much for inviting me. I'm so excited, Lauren, to meet you. I'm so excited to meet you too. On screen. And it's so weird that I think of meeting on screen because you feel like you know all these people that you've done for me. It's true. I've been reading you for years and have read books that you've written and you know, I actually do know your brother-in-law a little bit, the fashion banker. Oh, you and the fashion banker who I'm staying with. I'm actually, I've been in New York. I'm staying in his son's bedroom. His son hasn't come back from college yet. Do you know what it's full of? Smelly trainers, sneakers. I have a three-year-old and I keep waiting to see when he's going to start to smell because he doesn't smell at all. Oh, they smell so gorgeous when they're three. Yeah. He's a, it's just like when is it going to be? 14. You've got about 10 years. Oh, good, good. So what did you, the first thing we ask on this Friday edition of fashion people is, what did you have for breakfast? I can tell you exactly because I just had my breakfast at Mamon on the corner of Washington and Horatio with Lucy and with you and the fashion banker. I had two sides of avocado, one side of sourdough toast with olive oil, one sparkling water and a quartado with less milk. That sounds great. It's very specific. They, they, I go in every morning and they, they look, I have to say the whole thing every time and they look really surprised and I've said it the day before. Even in America, the quartado has too much milk. My husband also orders an iced quartado and has to be like less milk. Yeah. But the quartado is, I think the most delicious coffee. I love it because it's not, it's, it's more than a macchiato and less than a flat white. I agree. And it gives you the milk complements the coffee, but it doesn't overtake the flavor of the coffee. Exactly. Exactly. Anyway, Mamon was very nice. And when I was last in New York, which was, get this five years ago, there were no Mamons and I was talking with Lucy last night about, she was saying, do you feel like it's really changed? And I said, obviously there's a few new stores and things, but when I was actually walking down the street yesterday along West 4th and had stopped at St. Ambrose for a little, to pick up a few biscuits and stuff, I was like, I just feel like I'm back in 1998. It's exactly the same. It's lovely. You know, it's lovely. I feel very at home here. When did you move back to the UK? I moved back to the UK in, oh God, I mean a long time ago, like 2005, 2006, I got married, I had my children and moved back, but I kept an apartment in New York until 2010. And I used to spend a lot of time going back and forth. When I had my second child, I felt I wasn't able to. I used to travel with my first child and my nanny and we used to go back and forth, so I'd work in both places, but with two children, it was too much. That is exactly the situation I'm in. We do not have an apartment. We stay in friends' places a lot. One baby is completely transportable, like one dog. Yeah. And then with two, it just changes. But the thing about two is it's so much better for everyone. Yeah. It's so wonderful having two children. I absolutely love having two children. But you can't travel with two babies on your own on a plane. No, no. I don't know if you can travel with two babies and two people on it. I mean, I guess people do it all the time. After having my kid, I was like, I can't wait to have the second. And then a year in, I was like, oh, this is pretty easy. So I think we're done. But we'll see. Hopefully he won't be in too much therapy for me making him an only child. I remember flying back from New York one time with Ursula, who's now 17, and she was probably I don't know, maybe six or seven months old. And she was in a bata net at the bottom of my feet. And I'd gone to sleep. And about halfway through the flight, someone comes and pokes me and says, you got to wake up because your baby's crying. And I was so fussy and hadn't heard. And then I think then I was just like, this is really hot. It's really hot. Yes. Well, I'm glad you're in New York now and congrats on the publish publication of your latest book. It's very exciting. So much, darling. How long does it normally take you to write a book or an article? Well, actually, both. I'm very curious. Are you super? I could see you being super fast turnaround. For for an article. So the articles, like if you're doing it, I would say if you're doing a cover for American Vogue, which is high pressure, heavy duty, and it's got to be absolutely immaculate, actually about it could take up to four weeks with all the travel and all the interviews that you've got to do and all the writing and all the editing, even maybe five weeks. So it's like doing a cover is a major commitment. Take a month out of your life. But you're doing smaller articles for Vogue or like actually, I just did one for the New York Times, which was super exciting. That's so exciting. Guess what? Today, I'm going for lunch at the New York Times cafeteria. I'm so excited. Iconic. It's so fun. Who are you having lunch with? I've never been to the New York Times. I just can't wait to go there. I'm having lunch with Tony Ratano, who edited the article. Who actually used to work for Graydon initially. Then the. I know. Della Botheby, who I've never met, who who looks like she's the most fascinating woman her career has been absolutely fascinating. She is the best. I'm a huge fan. She's a little scary in the best way. She's a real editor. She's fabulous. You're going to love her. It's I bet she's a tough cookie. She's very tough and one of my favorite people who works in fashion, especially one of the best editors I've come across in my career. And the styles is incredible. So I can't I'm so excited about that because I wanted to write for New York Times for my whole career and I achieved it this week. So what is what is the piece about? This story is relates to my book Wives Like Us just to sort of fill in the listeners. The story of Wives Like Us is a comic satire of country princesses studying the Cotswolds, which is a very beautiful part of England. But it's all seen through the eyes of the executive butler who's like a kind of Mary Poppins meets Jeeps. The story for the New York Times that I wrote is butlers then and now. So what was a butler like when I was a child? And what is a butler like now? So they've gone from being the Carson to being like a private matriot or hotel. They're so sophisticated now. They wear Shavey Tyson lounge suits. And I was able to do it because I've got a cousin who lives up in Yorkshire on a great big fat sites estate where I've never lived, but I've visited a lot. You've got there as a child and they had a butler called Michael, who was an Irish butler and he'd been there since 1959. And you know what he was? He was a huge practical joker. So he loved a practical joke. So we would go there as children and he would come into the dining room to serve lunch with the Romney portraits and the chandeliers. Huge pink wig, glasses on springs where the eyeballs popped out while you were having the lunch. He actually once rode a bicycle into the dining room with a portrait on the on the balanced on the handbars and served the pork from the bicycle. So British. What's interesting about it is that now if your butler rode into your dining room on a bicycle, people would think they were either drunk, mad or very rude. Then it was funny, you know, like then it was OK. And also rich people then who were kind of behemoth aristocrats. That's what the family butler or retainer was like. But rich people now are much more sort of bourgeois in a way. They want perfection. So the idea that someone would wear a wig into their dining room and cause a laugh, it just it just wouldn't work. You know what I mean? If you're a Russian oligarch, that's not going to work for you. Do you think that the influx of non British people has changed British humor in the last 25 years? Gosh, that's such a good question. Non British people into the UK. Yes, because I live I live there from 04 to 06 and it was still very British. Yeah. You know where I work quintessentially. Oh, my God, with Ben Elliott. Yes. Yeah. Oh, my God. Who now who now is not only is like a Lord. He's in the house of Lords or a sir. What? Yeah. He's the chairman of the Conservative Party, the Tory Party. What? I had no idea. Yeah. That is hilarious. His job was to raise money for the Conservatives because he's so connected. To me, he's a nightclub guy. Yes. So he was a nightclub guy and nephew or something. They got married when I lived there and I worked for him. Oh, how funny. And I also remember I he was going to the US a lot. Yes. And going back and forth. And I was going back and forth and I had like an issue with my work permit because I was supposed to leave and apply. I'm sure you've had a deal with this. And because it was actually quite cheap, it's actually quite cheap to get a work permit for the UK. It was like 250 pounds, but you have to not be in the UK. Yeah. So I got it and like it was very nice. And I just remember he was very nice about it. But it's it was a funny experience. It was my first job out of university. And you must have had a real because the his sense of humor is very, very British, very old school English and everything's a joke. Everything's a joke. Yes. I think to answer your question, the influx of, you know, Americans, Russians, the Russians are kind of going now anyway, because of what's happened. Yeah. French. I think actually they love the English sense of humor, that irony, that wish to satirize, that wish to make a sort of funny jokes. And the Irish sense of humor, which is very kind of influential on the British sense sense of humor. I think they actually love it. And I think that what's nice is when those foreign people come in, they can see the funny side in a way that we can't. So it becomes funnier, do you know what I mean? Yeah. So yes, I love it when Americans come in. Like it was very funny this Christmas, someone wanted to to rent my house in the courtsworlds while I was away and they were American and they had watched the holiday and they decided that it was their fantasy to spend Christmas in the courtsworlds like Cameron Diaz in the holiday. Yes. And I was already laughing. I was like, the idea that you're going to rent a house based on it is, to me, it's absolutely hilarious. And then they came, I went away to Ireland for Christmas and then they came to the house they were from Chicago and they kept sending me these messages saying things like, we are waiting till Christmas Day to watch the holiday. Do you have the holiday on a DVD? And I was like, no one watches DVDs. And they're like, oh, my God, what are we going to do? And just the the interact, the intersection of American and British is absolutely brilliant. Right. It always works. It just works. We just get each other. So funny. But they were so sweet. They kept saying, we feel like we're in a movie. I'm imagining the family from Home Alone because they're in the suburbs of Chicago going to the courtsworlds to to watch the holiday. What was very funny? So they went all the way to the courtsworlds to watch the holiday like a 12 hour journey, whatever it was. And then they got there and then I started getting these messages. I was elsewhere going, where are the other showers? Did you tell us where the other bathrooms are? It's so America. Because my children, my children. Who were in their thirties, the boys like to take a shower. And I was like, oh, well, actually, it's bathrooms with baths. If there's an English thing like we love a bath, but they don't like baths. Where where are the showers? As though they were hidden in some secret passage for American people. So they had to get used to like a great big English delicious bath that's so comfortable. And I had all the oils and whatever left of them. But it was it's very funny that thinking that you're going to go to the English countryside, relax and dash in and out of the show in five minutes. And we're all thinking you want to sit in the bath for an hour. And it was anyway, they were absolutely adorable. They they were so sweet. They were so sweet.

So one of the things about your book that I just got it on Saturday and I was able to get through a good bit of it. Oh, well done. Yeah, of course. You're such a clever writer and the attention to detail is incredible. And you use fashion quite a bit for it. Tell me about the fashion in the Cotswolds because I imagine Amanda Brooks. You're completely right to imagine Amanda Brooks. So the fashion in the Cotswolds has gone from being, you know, riding Jodpas, Wellies and like a Farrell sweater to being a fabulous Oula Johnson silk dress, a pair of Chanel flats, a crossbody Yves Saint Laurent or Fendi bag, beautiful hat from Stephen Jones. It has elevated. I blame for the elevation of fashion in the Cotswolds. You guys. The Americans. OK, the Park Avenue princesses landed in the Cotswolds. It's like Bergdorf Blancs landed in the Cotswolds and everyone had to elevate. So their country chic is like a sort of fantasy version of, you know, Alora Ashley, Beatrix Potter. It's incredibly luxurious and it's become it's a bit like what people wear on the Hamptons on the weekend. It's all it's relaxed labels. I think the Amanda Brooks shop cutter Brooks and Amanda Brooks was the fashion director Barney. She had this brand called Tula. She was she were you were you all friends when you lived in New York or kind of running in the same circles? I met so Lucy Sykes, my sister, my twin sister claims that she discovered Amanda Cotter. Right. Amanda Cotter was Patrick Blanchelier's assistant and Lucy was working at Bazaar. And that's how Lucy discovered her as this gorgeous, beautiful girl. Then Amanda became like fashion director of Barney's. She worked for all these people. We all knew her and she married Chris Brooks, who was English, who we all knew as well. So I've known her for years. And what was amazing was when she married Chris, she transplanted herself to the Cotswolds. She raised her children. And then the minute that she'd finished raising her children, because she was smart, she had her children when she was very young. She parlayed all of that fashion knowledge she had and all of that buying expertise. She's the world's greatest shopper, right? Into stocking the most beautiful store and describing the lifestyle of the Cotswold princesses in a shop. And what's interesting is she exported it all to America. So people would ring her from America and say, I want the whole look, the table, the candles. And of course, it was coming from John Derian. So it went from John Derian in New York over to Amanda Brooks in England. She turned it into an English country look. And then back it goes to Marigolds. Fascinating. It's so funny. I was going to say, I feel like she single-handedly revived the John Derian Christmas ornament obsession for a new generation of women. And I think didn't, didn't, um, Ermael or Graydon Carter write an entire kind of thesis about how she'd invented the Cotswolds as a chic place by creating this store, which was a magnet. And I remember when she opened it, it was only, it only opened about seven years ago. And everyone who came to stay with me for the weekend, the trip, it wasn't like I want to go and visit, you know, a national trust house or I want to go on a walk. I want to go to Carter Brooks and we'd all go to Carter Brooks. And Amanda would be there behind the counter looking stunning in a dough and outfield or whatever. I remember Daniel Ramolders, who's a good friend of mine coming. That's where he wanted to go. He wanted to go and sit on the sofa at Carter Brooks and chat to Amanda. Of course, that's what we all do. It's so funny. It's the dough end, also her bringing dough end to the UK. I'm sure I wonder how much of their business comes from the UK because of her. Yeah, probably, probably a lot because she introduced it to the UK. I think she's the only person who solved it in the UK. She's a real powerhouse, Amanda. You've got to hand it to her. She's amazing. It's so impressive. I kind of want to stay at that at her cottage. You can stay at the cottage nearby. Yeah, yeah, you should. But what I find interesting about her, this is the American fashion person figures out how to export English countryside glamour back to America, which the English haven't really figured out how to do because it takes an outside eye to say, this is the dream. This is the fantasy. The fantasy of the English countryside is the export. It's a bit like we export schools like Eaton and Oxford. It's true. Here's a question for you. I was thinking about your career before before we got started in the last few days. And you you were a British vogue first out of out of university. Yes. Tell me about that era in fashion, because the thing that you're describing right now is this idea of like when I think of the UK, there aren't, especially in in when you break down the class system, like the idea of an outsider in the UK. I feel like it doesn't exist in the way it does in America. You can Ralph Lauren could really like separate himself from everyone else and say, I'm an outsider because he grew up in the Bronx and he was Jewish or whatever. Whereas in the UK, because the class system is so open and kind of entrenched. Yes. It's almost like being an ounce. It doesn't it doesn't feel like that's as much of a concept in in the UK. I don't know. But but when you were coming up, there were a lot of people coming from different classes who were working in fashion. So I think two things. Social mobility in England is much more restricted than in America because of the class system and the class system is entrenched in the UK. However much people don't want it to be and whatever they do, there's a there's a whole in in politics, there is a leveling up secretary to try and level level out the playing field for people. But what was very interesting about the 90s in fashion was that the people who came through and I think actually this is true in fashion in general. Fashion is a democracy. It is only about how good you are. No one really cares where you come from, except funnily enough in modeling. Right. So modeling is very nepotistic, as we know. So everyone loves Stella Tennant partly because she was the niece of the Duchess of Devonshire. And I remember people like Mario Testino or they were very, very snobbish. They loved the glamour and then they could go to tax. But if you're a fashion designer or a fashion photographer and you've got to produce, deliver something exceptional, who cares where you came from? So let's go and talk about Alexander McQueen. He was literally the son of a black cab driver and he was incredibly proud of that. And he. Acted and talked like a cocky East End cab driver himself. And that was actually the charm. So his outside in this, his working classness was part of his brand. And then he could be the on-fond terribler of British fashion, which he very quickly understood how to use that and parlay into a lot of press coverage, which is how he built his business as well. And Hussain Cheleyan, who I spent lots of time with as well, who was wonderful. He used to do things like make an entire collection and then bury it all in the ground for six months to age it. He was actually a Turkish. He was originally Turkish descent, Turkish Cypriot. So he was an immigrant. John Galliano is Portuguese descent. And I do think that the people who've come to a country, whether it's America or England from outside, they've got this drive to make it, to get in that when you're already in the establishment, you don't have it as much. What was the hunger? Where's the drive? Right. My hunger and drive came from the fact that my family were sort of, it was, I didn't want to call it a broken family because that's the wrong word, but my parents got divorced just before I went to university or just when I went to university and it was devastating and I felt very, very insecure. And I became very driven. I was like, I need to stand on my own two feet. I need to depend on myself. And I remember Alexander saying to me, the Queen, I was interviewing him for the first Kachur show. I'm sorry, first Kachur show that he did for Givenchy in Paris, which was an amazing moment. And I said to him, what drives you? You know, you're so successful. He was only 27 at the time and you're designing six collections a year for Givenchy, six collections from a Queen. You're making films with Dick Knight. And he went, Oh, don't be ridiculous. It's my insecurity. I went, what? You're in school. Yeah, everything that drives me is insecurity. I guess that is what drives people. Yeah, at the time, you know, I was only 27 as well. I didn't understand what he meant. He was very psychologically mature, actually, in many, he really was old before his time. I didn't really understand how you could become Alexander McQueen because you were insecure. But that was kind of behind it. And that thing of being a perfectionist and it never been good enough, that drives people. But, you know, to go back to your point, I mean, the 90s was a time when a lot of interesting people came up through fashion and it didn't matter what their background was. It was just like, are you good? Are you breaking the mold? Are you interesting? A lot of great photographers came through that way. When you moved to New York, what was the difference in the kind of fashion scene and the people around you there versus in the UK where like a lot of those kids and artists were all coming out through St. Martins, right? Like that early 90s group of people. They did. They came out through St. Martins. Well, when I came to New York right at the beginning, so we're talking like 1997, 1998. You know, the the the fashion scene, it was quite. And it was almost establishment. So it was Michael Kors, Calvin Klein, Carolina Herrera, Vera Wang, who actually I've got great admiration for all of those designers. They've built incredible businesses. You know, Oscar de la Renta was one of the cooler designers. You know, he was dressing Sarah Jessica Parker for Sex and City. These were kind of very grand prom dresses. It was a completely different aesthetic. It was a done art Park Avenue princess as the outsider who'd come from Grand G London. I was like, wow, these girls are wild. They are glamorous. They are so amusing that in on the joke that they're a joke. And Anna basically put me on. I'll call it my beat was the Park Avenue princesses. That was my beat. We didn't realize that was my beat. But looking back now, I'm like, that was my beat. It was the girl in the dress, not just the dress. Sally Singer was the dress at the front row at the shows. She could write. I was a shitty reviewer. I could not write a review in 10 minutes like Susie Menkees or Sally. But I could write about the girl in the dress. And to go back to your point, what was the difference? The difference was the manicures, the blowouts, the eyelash extensions, the nose waxes, the pedicures, the level of polish and glamour I found intoxicating and so fun to write about. Did you know Carolyn Bassetta at all? Was she around and was she like a person of interest for you? I think she was a person of interest for absolutely everyone in New York at the time. She was an icon. I never met her in real life. I think I may have seen her at a party or two. But actually, when I wrote Bergdorf Blondes and prior to that, when I wrote lots of articles about how to be blonde, her hair was the iconic hair because it was white blonde, not yellow blonde. And literally in the beginning of my book, Bergdorf Blondes, we say, I said, the character says it's all about being blonde like Carolyn Bassetta. She was absolutely an icon and it's so interesting now that she's become even more of an icon, like a Marilyn Monroe almost, you know, because of the tragic, tragic, young end. It's wild how much I get fed stuff about her on Instagram in particular. Do you? Yes. By your algorithm. Probably because I'll like like a photo of her or whatever. Yeah. And I don't follow any of those fan accounts, but I just every single my feed is just filled with images of her. God, do you know what? I wish my feed was filled with images of her. I'd really like that instead of the craps. This like I get sent, you know, when I get sent because of my age, I get sent cardigans or fuzzy sweaters for living in the country. I don't want that. I want I want Carolyn Bassett Kennedy all the time. You need to. There is a pair of Prada sandals that she wore that are so good. And I posted once like I didn't know they of course they were Prada. I guess that's the all the shoes she wore. But and I get at that time, there were probably not as many shoe brands for you. Like what were the go to shoe brands like Prada? Prada was a huge thing. I was always writing about Prada. But hang on, just to go back to Carolyn Bassett Kennedy. So I was in my hairdresser the second day arrived in New York. The first thing I had to do was go and get my haircut. OK, Ashley Javier. I walk in, I sit down and then about 10 minutes later, Annabelle Dexter Jones walks in, right? Who's this fabulous actress who was on succession and he did her hair for succession, did that incredible blonde bob and made her look so incredible. So good. We soon start talking about Carolyn Bassett Kennedy. She soon says that Ryan Murphy is doing Carolyn Bassett and John Kennedy. And I was like, but Annabelle, you've got a BCBK. You look like her. You've got the hair. And she was like, that's what me and a lot of other actresses are thinking. And then we had this very funny conversation where I just said, look, you've just got to dress with her all the time now. You go to the camera. She sort of does. She is her. She's got all the cost. Don't you think that would be perfect? And they've both got the hyphenated second name. Yes. If you watched her Vogue video where she goes to that upper east side. Yeah, it's called like it's search with a Z. It's that drugstore. It's a perema. Yeah, it's fabulous. I love it. Yeah, it's so good. She's really a real bright spot. That girl, I think she's a wonderful actress as well. I agree. I agree. It must have been like being transported and transplanted into that world. I know you did that famous piece on Taka, but the different brands you're writing about like. Yeah. What? And it was such an era of women. It girls wearing pretty slip dresses and things like I'm sure in the UK it was ghost was was the big thing. Yeah. But what were what were the brands everybody was wearing? What what was sort of like the stuff you were documenting during that time? God, I'm just trying to think. Taka was a huge thing and it blew up in about two years. It was amazing. There were a lot of independent brands downtown in Elizabeth Street. People like Jane Mail and they were designing these like pretty summery dresses that were great for young people. There was a huge interest in sneakers because of Boohoo. Well, I'm sorry, Boo.com. Do you remember that? Oh, yes. Yeah. So there was this big interest also in technical shoes and tech wear that was just starting. This sort of athleisure thing was just just starting. But when I was kind of catapulted into it, it was still initially like these big, big brand designers, actually, because that's obviously who Vogue was working with in the main body of the magazine. That was the advertisers. But in the front of the magazine, there was a huge emphasis on personal style. So we were always photographing girls in personal style. They bought a lot of their clothes at the flea market on, I think it was on like 24 Street on the weekends. There was a lot of vintage, a lot of silk slip dresses that were imitating John Galliano's very expensive slip dresses. We would kind of like wander down Elizabeth Street and just go into all these little boutiques, many of which are not here now. Zach Pozen was just starting and we were all enamoured with him with his personality and the way that he could basically make a couture dress in New York. He made some amazing party dresses for people and, you know, he's such personality. Yeah, I remember seeing him at the... I don't know how to pronounce it in British English, the Barclay, the hotel in the blue room at a party there in like 05. Had he... I worked with someone who had gone to St. Martin's with him, but it was like the first really famous fashion designer who I ever saw in person. Right, right. Yeah. I saw him the other night, actually. He's just, you know, he's become CEO of the Gap. Well, he's he's Chief Creative Officer of the Gap. Or sorry, Chief Creative, not CEO of the Gap. But yes. Sorry, you might as well. But also he's just got the personality to drive things. He's just got this magnetic. He's he's in such good form. He's like on fire. I can't even tell you. It's amazing. I've talked to a lot of people who are working with him there and have said that he's brought a really good attitude to a good New York. Get it done attitude to San Francisco, which they need. I don't know much time you spent there, but that's a whole other situation. I've spent a couple of days there and I found the hills extremely worrying. It's it's tough. It's tough. Like walking around San Francisco is like, oh, my God, this is exhausting. Yeah, it's lovely. The white king and stuff outside is absolutely divine. There's no the Marin headlands. There's nowhere more beautiful in the world. It's heavily. But I'm just trying to think what other brands we were really obsessed with in the 90s. I mean, Helmutland. Yeah. Absolutely. Obsessed. I had a white Helmutland suit, white jacket, white trousers. It just looked like a boy suit. It was like what a what a bus boy would wear. Do you know what I mean? And I had the I had the denim jacket with the very, very long arms and the turnbacks. I still got that piece and it's so beautifully cut. But I remember someone saying to me, you are dressed like a baggage handler at JFK. But that was that was the look. It was it was just a kind of utilitarian chic. And he really changed the aesthetic. He changed the 90s or rather the 90s became sort of in his image. And everyone wants that cool, minimalist look, which is also what Carolyn Bessack Kennedy was doing. And it was a change from like the brashness of the 80s, the Chanel, the La Croix. That sort of slowly faded. But you still always in New York had this society girl, this upper east side. You know, it was still people like Nan Kempner and Jane Reitzman was still going to the ball at that time in an amazing Caroline Everera ball skirt with like a twin set and a huge diamond. And I love seeing that. You would never have seen that in that look in London at a party ever. You know, an image of you from the Met Gala in I think 05 or 06 came up on my Instagram the other day. I don't think you posted it. I wish I remember I was going to scream screenshot. I think you were wearing something blue. But how? When would you have your memory of your first Met Gala? I do. I do. Yes, please. So the first Met Gala was this. I arrived at American Vogue in 1997. I didn't know what the Met was or what the Met Gala was. And it used to happen in December, not in May. So it was kind of over that year, Christmasy kind of festive thing. And around beginning of November, Anna Winter said to me, oh, you know, I have this party at the Met and I just wanted you'd like to have a table and invite your friends. It sounds like she thought you were very cool. Well, I have no idea what she was thinking, but I was like, oh, OK, that's that's fun. OK, I better invite some cool people. And I knew Kate Driver, who was a mini driver sister. A mini driver was like this big actress. And I was like, well, let's have the driver's. And then let's have my twin sister, obviously, did everything with me. Lucy and Ewan. Actually, Ewan took Anna Winter for a spin on the dance floor, which was hysterical. I believe it. There's loads of pictures. It was very, very funny. She loved Ewan. And then let's have like, I think we had Matthew Williamson and a couple of other British designers. And as ever, I thought, what am I going to wear? But it wasn't a it wasn't like the Oscars of the fashion world then. It was a party for socialites, fashion designers and fashion people. And there would be one or two celebrities, which was fun. People got very excited if Sting came. And I thought, what am I going to wear? Better go into the faux closet. Padded down the corridor of Madison Avenue, which is where we have the offices that time, saw a lovely John Galliano slipdress hanging on a rail, which was just a little spaghetti straps, bias cart printed with 12 jewellery, like a French wallpaper, beautiful. Put that on, put some manolos on, didn't get hair or makeup, went to the party, had the best time, was astounded by this situation. But it was kind of great that I didn't know what I was in for. And I think that Sting actually came out and played. So it was like a private concert because the Met Ball was very small then. It was 300 people or something, three, four hundred people. And it was just so kind of intimate and fun. And I was like, OK, this is real New York glamour. It's very easy to be nostalgic and look back at things you never experienced. But yes, you know, growing up, I'm a bit younger than you. And this was the world that I was the world I wanted to live in. What was it like working at Vogue in during that time when there were town cars and there were budgets and all of that stuff that none of us ever got to experience? I know it's very interesting because a lot of people your age are saying to me, like I've had a speaking engagement this week and people in their twenties and thirties, they see the nineties as the golden age of fashion. Now, of course, in the nineties, we saw the eighties as the golden age of fashion in terms of numbers of town cars. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's how we're measuring the golden age of fashion is on how many town cars were idling outside 350 Madison. I mean, there was traffic jams of black town cars. So it was different when you talk about budgets. There was no budget. Right. No one ever said to me, we need to discuss the budget or there's a budget. Or Anna really kept us all away from that so that we could just be completely creative and say, this is my idea. This is what I want to do. I never ever once had anyone say you can't do this because it's too expensive. If I want to interview someone and I said, get on the plane and go do it. Not we can't afford to send you. It just it was different because remember these magazines were making vast amounts of money and the and the business model was completely different. It wasn't broken by the internet. So the change was social media and the internet kind of ate the magazine budget. It was really good fun. But we didn't have completely unrestricted access to town cars. We did have to justify it somewhat. But I think it was more the more interesting thing was that you were able to if you needed to go to LA to meet someone you weren't if you need to go to Milan, you went if you wanted, you know, and they wanted to put you up in great hotels because you would invite people there. So if we were in Paris, we were always in the cost because we were inviting people to meet us. And what was very, very funny was at one point, me and Lucy, my twin sister were both on magazines at the same time and we said to both magazines, well, we're both going to be in Paris. Wouldn't it be much, much cheaper or better for both of you if we had a suite together? Yeah, of course. So we then had a suite and we proceeded to invite all of our friends from London to stay in the suite during the collections. Amazing. So she worked at Bazaar, right? She worked at Bazaar and then she worked at Marie Claire. So we did a lot of these things together, which was which was really funny. Was there a lot of like comparing and contrasting Hurston Konde at the time or was it not? I mean, I'm sure it was even more competitive than now in some ways. Oh my god, it was incredibly competitive. It was incredibly competitive and Harpist Bazaar was so, so chic and they had incredible photographers. But Lucy and I would, we would tell each other the stories we were doing, but we weren't really doing the same thing, actually, because she was a fashion editor, stylist and I was a fashion writer, but we would always be suggesting things to each other and we were obsessive about fashion. We've spent hours discussing the Fendi Baguette situation, for example. Hours. How many did you have? Absolutely millions, often. They just, they just gave them out like, like Eminems.

Have you ever done a sale of your closet like with the real real or something like that? I bet you have a really incredible setup. Well, do you know what? It's funny because I was actually talking to someone yesterday. I have got so many things that I need to sell and I actually have not got round to it yet. But every time I do think about selling some of it just just to make room. And a lot of these things are things that I would not wear. You know, I can't wear now. I wouldn't wear now. They're from the 90s. I can't quite bear to let go of them because they're sort of part of my life and my history. The things I will never let go of the McQueen pieces that he gave me personally that go back to 1993, if you can imagine, and some of them were in the Savage Beauty show and the V&A and stuff, like really extraordinary things. I don't really know what I'm going to do with them. They just are there. And what's quite interesting is I was contacted recently by a child from my girl's school in Cheltenham, the mother, and this girl is 14. She's extremely talented designer. She's only 14. And the mother said, can we come over and see you? And I said, you can. Why don't you come into my closet and I'll show you everything. And I took this 14 year old girl into my closet and she was going nuts. And then I said to her, and you know what, if you want to come back and look at any of my magazines, I've got British Vogue and American Vogue going back to 1993. You can come here and study it. And she was so excited. Maybe it's better just to have it as an educational museum. I don't know. I think so. I mean, those McQueen pieces in particular, those are, yeah. I mean, it's like they're they're priceless. Yeah. And some of the jackets from the early 90s, I mean, the structure, the millions of different pieces to create the form and to create the silhouette are just breathtaking, the detail and the work is amazing. How closely, because again, as I said, the the detail in your book in terms of the specifics of how you describe people through their clothing, it almost reminded me of Brett Easton Ellis, although he kind of lists out clothing. So I have to tell you the funniest thing. A friend of mine, a man, read the book and he came back to me and he said, Plum. He's like, I love this book. It's so funny. And he said, Plum, the only way I can describe this book is a cross between Thackeray's Vanity Fair and Brett Easton Ellis, American Psycho. And I was like, Oh my God. And he said it's because the amount of detail about the clothes and the brands. I think that because of my training at American Vogue as a fashion writer, which is Observe, Report, Report the details. And I've got an eye for detail anyway. I just have it's just in me. For me, the clothes are a way into the character. They're a very easy way for the reader to understand what someone is like without meeting them and without seeing a photograph. So if you say she was in a Vera Wann wedding dress, we kind of know who she is already, don't we? Yeah. Yes. If you say she was in a pair of crocs at the party, she's a rebel. But I'd rather say that than say she's a rebel. It's so boring just to say she's a rebel, right? Yes. And I always I just I just feel like clothes are the way in. And I did say this to someone the other day. Susie Menke's, who is an icon to me as a fashion writer, has this brilliant question that I stole from her for interviews, which is to ask anyone famous or whoever you're interviewing. What is your first memory of fashion? OK, and I remember asking Gwyneth Paltrow this question the first time I met her in an interview to her and she said to me, I remember my father, I was three years old, and he gave me this pair of dunkeries. And I think we actually managed to get a picture of the pair of dunkeries. And then she went straight on and started talking about this very close relationship we had she had with her father, who she got an incredibly well with. Bruce Paltrow. And I realized this was the most amazing first question to ask someone, because instead of saying, tell me about your relationship with. Tell me about you. You say, tell me about your piece of clothing and they go straight back to their childhood and it's not an invasive question. It's the way into people. That's why I love interviewing famous people for vote, because I never have to ask them a personal question. I just ask them about their clothes and it reveals everything. It's it's very insightful. I heard you when when Leanna interviewed you the other night and nine orchard, there was actually a puck edit. One of my editors, Danny, was there and he was very excited when you mentioned Puck. So thank you. He texted me immediately. That event was so fun. I cannot tell you the atmosphere was amazing. So sad I missed it. It looked fabulous. So you mentioned in that interview, Leanna, then put that question back on you and said, and you mentioned these Victorian dresses that your mother used to make you wear, but I'm curious, like as a teenager, what was a first piece that you remember? As a teenager, remember, it was the 80s, Lauren. Did you have big hair? You didn't have a perm, though, did you? I did have a perm at one point. It didn't work because my hair was straight. It lasted about a minute. I could see you having like the cool girl hair that you had a little flip, but it was not too big. I wanted that, you know, the breakfast club thing. I had very, very, very long straight hair and I was always trying to make it curly. And I had so much hair. But the first few sort of important out. So first of all, remember, in England, you have to wear school uniform all the time. Right. My mother was a fashion designer and if I wanted clothes, right, if I wanted a party dress, I made it. OK, I was very good on the sewing machine. She would cut a pattern or she would say, one of my seamstresses will make it for you. Just just show me what you want. So we got very used to the idea that we can make anything we want. And I remember the first big kind of ball, we called them a ball, then party that I went to was about 15 or 16. And I was like, I need a ball gun. So my grandmother sewed me a maroon, taffeta, boned, bodiced, strapless ball gun. That was that's one of the first and that dress. I didn't know anyone at the party. I just had fun because I was wearing that dress and black, very sort of like Princess and Black Suede pumps, which were very 80s, black opaque tights, very 80s, we all wore black opaque tights with everything. And then when I went to Oxford, there's a very funny picture of me going out to a party and we're now talking 1989, 1990. And I'm standing there and wearing gold lame drainpipe trousers, a little tiny boob tube, very 80s. And my hair is all backcombed and sprayed and loads and loads of blue I make up. And the other funny one is that when I went for my interview at Oxford University again, I said, Mum, I don't know, what am I going to wear? It's absurd to think that I was worried about what I was going to wear. I was only 17 and I tore this picture out of British Vogue and it was Christie Tirlington wearing a double breasted coat dress that had been designed by a designer called Alistair Blair, right? It was very famous in England at the time and it was velvet and it had pink buttons. I said, Mum, can you make me the coat dress in very, very serious and navy blue wool? Absolutely. So this beautifully tailored coat dress up to my thighs. That's what I wore to my university interview with the professors of history at Oxford. So fabulous. So, you know, it does doesn't it tell you a lot about someone? Yeah, I mean, it does. But to be be that observant, I mean, in the first the first scene in in the book, the Butler, you talk about the Tom Ford glasses, Colin Furth and a single man. And you immediately see him. Exactly. And also, I think that Tom Ford make the best glasses. I think they make the best frames. But actually, when I when I watched a single man, which I watched it when it first came out and I watched it again recently and it must have kind of sunk into me. That look that Colin Furth has in that film, I mean, they completely made him over. He's he's immaculate. And then what's funny is that these new chic butlers that these rich ladies have, who sort of look after that everywhere, they dress like that. They're like in a lounge suit. They're not in a tailcoat and chock or pinstrikes and things. They are chic beyond belief because they're standing there greeting the guests while the lady of the house is doing Pilates. They're front and center. It's completely different. I can't wait to read this styles piece. Does it come out on on Thursday? It'll come out in the paper on Thursday, I hope. I'll link to it in the newsletter and it will be up by the time this airs. And actually, they did the most incredible photographs of this Butler in England, who is the ultimate executive Butler. I mean, the photos, you will die when you see them. So you are done with this book, but now you have to promote it for the next whatever. Yes. Maybe it'll get made into a movie or something, which would be very exciting. And have any of your films been made into TV? I think it's very, very likely. So it's really interesting, Lauren. There you are in LA and you know this world. But every book I've written has been optioned multiple times. None of them have actually made it to the screen. They've been optioned as television or movies. But this is very normal that they then don't make it because it's so difficult to get something made. But I feel that this one, it's so ripe for it. And I feel it's it's got a lot more longevity in a funny way because it's not the Iqal of now, now, now. You know, Bergdorf Blonds was optioned, but the Bergdorf Blonds were out of date quite quickly, do you know what I mean? It's a different time now. Park Avenue Princess. But I feel like this story of these glamorous women in the countryside and their fabulous butler in this American interloper who comes and shakes things up is it's a classic story that can go on and on. And I feel that people I mean, the response to this book, I cannot tell you, it's amazing, the readers, they love the characters. And all they're saying, when can I see on the screen? When can I see on the screen? But I've got one producer in mind just trying to figure out how to get fun. Let's make it happen. Last question for you. What are you curious about right now? Like, what do you want to write about next? I'm sure you have a novel, another novel idea, but what is there's something that you want the assignment or maybe fashion related? Well, that's that's an interesting thing. So so on the novel front, what I what I would like to do is do a trilogy of these books, because I think why is like us, these I purposely left the end open for a sequel. So I want to do. Can you imagine this on your bookshelf? Why it's like us husbands like them and kids like theirs. Perfect. Right. With all these characters and then you can bring in more because I love series of books where you see the characters again. But in terms of journalism, I was actually talking to Anna last week and I was saying I'd really like to write some more pieces for Vogue. There's a few people I know who I'm talking to. There's a few people swelling around who are doing really good. I can't I can't say who there's one actress who we were talking about at lunch with some of the other forgets as they call them. And I said, Mark, no, Taylor, Taylor Antrim, who's a deputy. I said, Taylor, that's I want to do her. I obviously can't say who it is. Don't say. But I love doing a really a really sheet actress who's really accomplished is for me like the dream assignment, actually. Well, we'll be waiting with bated breath. Well, I'm your fabulous. You are fabulous. It was such a pleasure. It's so fun to chat with you. Thank you for taking the time. Thank you so much, darling. Thank you.
