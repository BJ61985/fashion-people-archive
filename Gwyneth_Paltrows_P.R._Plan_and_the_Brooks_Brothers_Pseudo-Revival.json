And today with me on the show is author Marissa Meltzer. We're talking Goop and Gwyneth, Brooks Brothers, Vacation Clothes, Various Scandals, and so much more. Happy Tuesday, everyone. I hate April Fool's Day, so I'm not going to act like it's April Fool's Day because who cares? It's the worst thing you could ever do to someone. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. Anyway, I'm in Los Angeles and laying fairly low. If you can call it that. Tonight, I'm heading over to the opening of the new skim store to check that out. But otherwise, I'm just really on the phone a lot. Call me. In Monday's Line Sheet, I wrote about this pretty wild situation over at this company called Castle, which you've probably never heard of, but essentially it's a white label platform for companies and people who want to layer on a clothing rental service onto their e-commerce. Anyway, who cares, right? Well, a lot of people in the American fashion industry care. Not to mention a lot of fancy investors, including KKR Head, Henry Davis, Bill Ackman, and a bunch of VC firms that you've heard of. The founder, Christine Hunziger, she actually raised over $500 million and turns out she was allegedly not being straight about how much revenue the company was bringing in. She was saying hundreds of millions of dollars. It was actually last year, something like $16 million. And she is now being investigated by the authorities for various things. So we'll see what happens. But Hunziger also happens to be a partner in the investment firm P180, which you may have heard of, which currently owns a majority stake in Vince and a minority stake in Joseph Altuzara and has a partnership investment in Elise Walker. I don't know the exact number for that one. They said it's a strategic partnership, but they're all wrapped up with each other. And I know many of you have talked to Christine over the years for one reason or another about investing, about using the service. Anyway, it's a fascinating sort of microcosm for some of the bigger issues in the industry. Just a pretty fascinating story. Also, if you love crossover episodes, I'm going to be on Jam Session this afternoon with my bud, Amanda Dobbins. We're talking about celebrity culture and Graydon Carter's memoir, which I guess is celebrity culture. So check that out. Speaking of Graydon's memoir, here's Marissa. Who has something to say about that and keeping Valley's memoir and plenty more. Marissa Meltzer, welcome back to Fashion People. Hi. Thanks for having me again. How's it going? How's life? It's good. New York had a heavy winter and all I can think about is spring, but the weather isn't totally cooperating. But we had, I'm sure you saw on social media, like three hours of 70 degree weather or something like that and people freaked out. I saw, I want to say Central Park or I think it was the sheet meadow. There was like a viral video. It was insane. And you know what I thought when I saw it, I thought, this is why I don't live there. Because there are no parks like that in LA because of the fact that it's nice like that all the time. Also because people have backyards. It's true. Yeah. Part of me was like, whenever I see that, there's part of me that is a little envious. The one that I always feel envious of is that Dolores Park in San Francisco. Oh, Dolores Park is beautiful. But again, San Francisco, I say this as a native of the Bay Area. It doesn't get that hot very often. It's not park weather. But I see I love a crowded park. It feels very like convivial and I don't know. It was not cognizant for the 70s, but it feel like that's what the 70s were like. Just like packed parks with people being friendly and sexy to each other. I think you got the sexy part right. People selling like, you know, a lot of drugs. Well, no, I'm yeah, maybe, but I was actually going to say cocktails. Like out of their bags. I don't know. Yeah, I feel like I like park culture. I do feel like, you know, if you if you got in New York in the 70s, it feels like you got in on the ground floor. Oh, absolutely. And I do feel really like jealous of people who bought homes in the 70s, who bought homes outside of the city in the 70s. Oh, even the 90s. Yeah. Even, you know, 2005. But I don't know, have you read the Great Encarter memoir? I did. I'm almost done with it. And I read the Keith McNally one that's I think coming out soon as well. And, you know, it's it's such the classic line of like, it was gritty. There was, you know, I had an apartment for $200 that had two bedrooms and so ho. And it was disgusting. And it was the greatest time of my life, you know, it's become a cliche, but it seems to be a cliche for a reason. $200 a month, a garden and an expense account. I actually went yesterday, BookSoup did a talk with Graydon, a friend of mine had tickets. Oh, fine. I did not bother to buy them someone gifted me a ticket. Oh, I went to one up in a Temple Emmanuel. Frank Gifford. How was it? Who interviewed him? Beth Midler. She was amazing. Oh, that's amazing. She's our last great American. She's so quick and witty and... And she was great. This was I had to leave early because I had child care responsibilities, but this was Monica Lewinsky, who I love, who's a lovely human being. Her hair looks amazing. She just looks truly incredible. Like she looks so good. But I would say that it was I was like, okay, I read all these anecdotes in the book already. Yeah, I saw him first. It was I think it was the day the book came out. And they were all new to me. And then I re-read them and thought, oh, okay, a lot of these. But you've done a book tour. It's kind of how it goes. Like people love asking in book tours, what didn't make your book? And it's like, babe, everything, we put it all in there. Like anything decent is in the book. Yeah. I felt like I was actually thinking because you interviewed Shontal and me at McNally Jackson in South Street Seaport, which was really great. I don't know. I think if I was interviewing Graydon, my line of questioning would have been totally different. So I think it's also about obviously you have the most famous person you can. And Monica has plays a big role in the book. And she was really like, everybody should read the book if you're interested in this stuff. It's a very polite book. That's how I would describe it. Yes. It's polite. It's a very like a little bit of a, it's laudatory. It's a lot of kind of giving praise and thanks where it's due and poking fun of people that can take it. But yeah, I think, I mean, look, it's hard to, I like to go off-piste and like just have a conversation with people in front of me. But I'm also a journalist. So that's my job is just being good at conversation. And that is not the job of Monica Lewinsky. And I will never have hair as glossy as hers or like, you know, it's a different skill set. But yeah, you want to get like the biggest draw. And that is, yeah, she's, but Midler was amazing. And I had forgotten that she had played Sue Mangers in a Broadway show that Graydon Carter had produced or that Vanity Fair both. Yeah. Yeah. I like that story in the book of his turn as a Broadway producer question for you. I have not read the Keith McNally book. I need to get the, the, I don't even know if it's a galley at this point, just a copy. But which one would, would you say got to you more emotionally? I don't know if I'm supposed, I feel like I'm going to get in trouble for saying anything, but who cares? The Keith one is extraordinary. If the Keith one wins, you know, awards, I wouldn't be surprised. I think there's, I think because his life, at least to me, is less public in terms of details. There are, there are things about his life that were surprising to me. And it's written with a depth of emotion that is, is pretty moving even to people with hearts of stone like myself. I cannot wait. I have a funny little anecdote in Monday's line sheet actually about, you know, he scheduled one of the book parties the same night as the Met Gala. Yeah. Which like, it's a power move. I love it. And what I did was I reached out to people very close to him and said, what's the deal? And they were like, we're not going to that one. We're going to one on Tuesday. So I think there's probably like seven or at least a couple. And this one seems to be the one that like a lot of downtown people are invited to. And there's going to be a Richard E Grant reading and there's like songs by people I'd never heard of before. And so it sounds fun. But I, the, the person was like, I'm sure he doesn't even realize. Also, because you know, he's very good friends with Anna. That's true. But also not that many people are invited to the Met Gala. I mean, it's, and a lot of the people that would want to go to a Keith McNally, maybe in the nineties, there would have been a higher overlap. But now I don't think that like, I don't know who's going to be there, like Bad Bunny and Sabrina Carpenter. Like it's just not the same. This is exactly what I wrote. Because someone, the person who told me about it was like, isn't this funny? Said, well, you know, maybe this person, and it names some like downtown social light-ish people who were big in the night, like very part of the nineties fashion scene. And I was like, they're not invited to the Met Gala anymore. That the Met Gala is like, I'm trying to think of since the last The only crossover it's like Chloe 70, maybe like Annabelle Dexter Jones or something like that. And, and Anna herself. Yeah. So I think the thing I, I just, my assumption is that that there is another thing that Anna will be involved in. And, and also the book comes out on Tuesday. So it's like the book comes out on Tuesday. You're going to have the thing on Monday and do something probably maybe Anna's going to something on Tuesday. That's the thing. I mean, she could also throw him a party in DC. There's just so many, you know, the book rollout, as we've seen now, is can be such a long, ever loving thing. She could be in conversation with him. And also he knows that she supports him. Like she's been, you know, there from his days at one fifth. And so also she's busy. It's not like you're, you're good friend who has kids who, you know, the barrier for entry is getting a babysitter. Like it's Anna Wintour. Yes. Yes. I would say that seeing Sarah Hoover's book tour and also Josh Duboff, I've been like, we didn't do enough stuff. How are you feeling about, because they've both, Sarah has been pounding the pavement. And I feel like Josh has too. Yeah. Do you, you have a book, is your book coming out in the fall or is it? Yeah, it just got moved up a month. It's coming out in October. Oh my God. It's coming out right around when yours did. I think it's on like October 6th or something like that, 7th. It's basically like the last day of Paris Fashion Week. Amazing. And it's about Jane Birkin. It's a biography of Jane Birkin. It's called It Girl. Amazing. It's going to be a huge hit. I know it. How are you feeling? You've done this before, so. I have, but in some ways that makes it worse because it's not a blank slate. Like you can't just get pressed because you're a new person writing a book. But I'm very proud of it. I think it's like, it's kind of the best thing I've ever written in some ways because it fuses like gossipy reporting with criticism, with like real kind of revisionist history and style and movie and music criticism in a way that, and plus doing it in two languages. It was, you know, it was a task, but I think it's, I think it's really good. And I think, you know, the question of like, how do you keep the spotlight on someone who is always kind of this like, amuse or ancillary character in their own life is a really important one. So I'm excited. I'm exhausted and overwhelmed. And all I want to do is like, have a mag, like Vogue from 1996 call and send me to a spa or, or like. We need to get you to that spot that would lands door for whatever. All I want is for Lanzaroff to call and for me to bring a friend and to do, and I'm like, just give me the hardest. I want the hardest regime that they can give me. I, it's gonna let's secret this to happen for you. Yeah. I mean, I have a sub stack. I can write about it then. I'll write about it for, you know, the magazine of anyone's choosing. But yeah, I want to eat like the really hard crumbly brown bread that they make you chew a ton of times. I want to take. So good. The weird laxatives. I want to, I mean, I just reviewed the book about Gala Dali and so much of her early years were spent at sanitariums in Switzerland, just getting like fresh air cures. Like bring us back. Anyone who could teach me how to chew my food, which I never had. This show is brought to you by Bokeh.

So moving on another press run, I wanted to briefly, Rachel last week wrote about sort of what's happening at Goop where, you know, there really aren't that many people working there at this point. Apparently they're hiring an editorial director. There's a tip for anyone who needs a job. But the week before GP Gwyneth Paltrow had done a vanity fair cover and in-depth profile with Michelle Ruiz, who I thought did a good job of it, about a movie, Marty Supreme, that she's doing that's not coming out until Christmas. And then she also simultaneously did a Q&A and fortune about the company. And I was like, and you know, she used to have a chief brand officer, Nura Raj Brown, who did all this stuff. I'm a big fan of hers. Yeah. Nura is great and is- She has a great, she has a very fun sub stack. It's a great sub stack and also was really good at her job. Yes. Very, very good at her job because, you know, we were calling her all the time about stuff that, you know, they don't want to talk about, but she was really good at protecting the company, but also not ignoring us, which is always helpful. Like, I thought she was really good at her job. Yeah. Who is a, the question for me is like, who managed this? And do you think, because like, you just did a piece with GP last year about Goop's 15th anniversary. And I've interviewed her a couple of times. My thing about her and you have more experience with celebrities, but is that like, she's really good. She doesn't need a PR in the room with her. Like, she knows what she's doing. Yeah. She can manage herself. And most like old school celebrities like that who have been around it forever or like that, but she's excellent at it and she's consistently doing press. But I just felt like this was too much. Like if I were her advisor, whoever was advising her, I'd be like, I don't think you need to come out right now and talk about the state of this Goop business, which is not like, is in, is in a restructuring mode, which is totally fine. But like, don't do a Q and A with a business bag. I don't know. I thought it was too much. I don't know. I have a theory behind it actually. Tell me. My theory is that all of this is planned towards a big Oscars award season run a la Demi Moore. And she's getting the Goop CEO corporate stuff out of the way now addressing it so that she doesn't have to when she does whatever major profiles, TV segments, the big push to sort of remind us that she's an actress, that she has this very glamorous looking role that was filmed all over my neighborhood last fall. And can't wait to see it. It looks great. And from some, you know, some people that we know some New York characters are in seem to have like little extras roles and stuff like that. Oh, fun. And yeah, I think that it's, I think the Goop stuff is her effort. I'm not saying it's successful, but of being like, I'm a CEO. Here's what I think about this country company that I've devoted, you know, 15, 17, 17 years of her life to she has the CEO role. She takes it seriously. And then come this, you know, fall, I imagine the movie could be premiering at New York Film Festival or, you know, something and, you know, come the fall when she really wants to do her. I'm reintroducing myself as an actress. Remember me? I won an Oscar. Now I'm going to get a support in one or at least try to. I think you may be right. I also think they've been trying, they would love to sell Goop. You know, nothing's ever for sale. But I think for many years, the reporting that I've done, obviously Rachel has done a ton of it, but I have heard like firsthand of her being like, let's get this going. And those, you know, financiers and VC behind it, they've got to be about as itchy as, you know, glossiers by now of like, let's get a return. Yeah. I mean, maybe not that much. I don't think many of them are going to get a return, to be honest. I think that like the big thing that I've learned, the interesting thing about Gwyneth Paltrow is she's a founder, she's a celebrity, and she's also truly the CEO of the company. A lot of people are like, I don't know, she's, I'm like, no, she actually runs the business. Like I've been reporting on it for long enough. Like, and that is part of the problem. She's never been able to hire someone who is strong enough to kind of run the business and that she trusts and all that stuff. Yeah, I mean, it's hard. My book about Glossier Haven, and I think so many of these sorts of like founder-centric brands have that issue where it's really hard to find your trusted number two. Which I get, I'm a control freak as well, but I also, you know, I'm very comfortable with what I don't know about and love farming out information to people who know what to do, but not everyone is like that. And, you know, I'm just talking about a very small scale with like my life and not, you know, goop. Totally. And she, she is incredibly smart and incredibly savvy. And so there aren't that many people who are as smart as her. So it's this thing of like, she has founder syndrome. She has celebrity syndrome. She has also is actually caught the issue of mama. Yeah. Yes. She's also competent. So it's this thing of like, it's this perfect storm. And she has this amazing thing and they never really figured out now. I mean, look, hopefully Goop Kitchen will sell for a ton of money, but that's a different cap table. So it's interesting. And, you know, as, as our friend, Amanda Dobbins always says, we wish her the best. We do. Although Amanda had a real breaking point with her lack of condemnation of RFK Jr., which I agree she has. I mean, she mentioned him in the article that I wrote about her for the New York Times. And, you know, she has a big platform to denounce him and she's not. So. Yeah. And yeah, if you all want to listen to that episode of jam session, it's, it's really good. And Amanda brought up a lot of good points. I think my feeling about that, and I think I said this to Amanda or made a comment when I linked to jam session in line sheet. But I just don't understand how she didn't just don't, just don't say it because during the pandemic, when the vaccine stuff kind of came up and also just like the beginning of the pandemic, they were extremely, Goop was extremely careful. They never said anything anti-vax. They never said anything pro-vax. They just like sort of got out of that world and didn't engage with it. And I thought, I was like, okay, this is smart of them because like this is litigious territory and be careful. So I'm just, I, I am surprised she didn't like just get around that question and but instead actively engaged with it. And that was, I was, I was shocked. I did, I thought it was not, I would not have advised her to do that, but you know. Yeah. I don't know who's, I wonder who is advising her if anyone is, I, you know, I think part of that is like the confidence and hubris of an actor, also someone who's somewhat sort of cloistered in West Coast. Wellness world where, you know, drinking raw milk seems pretty normal. And then, you know, you zoom out and you realize that, you know, these things have much more far reaching sociopolitical, cultural complications and connotations and consequences. So it will be an interesting year for Gwyneth Paltrow once again. She never escapes us. Yeah. I am, I love Michelle Ruiz and I thought the profile is great, but I'm very here for any, for any big Gwyneth profile. I'm, I've dined here all about Marty Supriam and her sort of engaging with the world as an actor again, for sure. I will read all of them. One thing I'm a little bit sick of, and then we should move on. We'll do a fire, quick fire round, because I know you want to discuss summer shopping. I think there have been too many movies about older women and young men. I'm done. I don't think it's stopping anytime soon because I'm a close reader of, like, Publishers Weekly, Publishers Lunch for Books. And I am seeing the sort of post all fours, Miranda July, effect on books. It seems like there's a lot of memoirs and novels coming out with the themes of sort of, you know, midlife sexual reawakening, be that with it's, you know, a younger person or what. And I imagine the same thing is going to be happening with, with movies and television. I, whether or not I like it. I don't know which, I don't know what pot, I don't think it was Amanda and Juliet on jam sessions. Someone was talking about this recently and made this point of like, can we just have older women having relationships with men their age? Like that would be interesting to me. Yes, but I will, as someone who is not married and having relationships. Yeah. It is once, it is interesting who is sort of, I don't know, hitting on you or who you're meeting. Like, I, all of my, you know, I've dated a lot of people much younger and much older than me. And I feel like a lot of the people my age are, maybe they just haven't gone divorced yet. It's coming. They're, they're tied up. But also like the, I also care less about my age. I'm more interested in, are we at similar places in our lives? You know, blah, blah, blah. But I'm also notorious for having strange taste in, in men or unpredictable. I think you, you, you have great taste and I enjoy hearing about as, as a person who's been married for a long time. I love hearing about your, your situations. I think, yes, I think the issue I have with it is it's very much about their age every single time. That's true. And it's like, who cares? Like this doesn't matter. Like it's, it, it needs to evolve beyond that. And I would say in all fours that it's not about what's his face's age. It's like, no, it's about where she is in her life as sort of this para menopausal woman. I don't know. I was just reading, do you, are you reading that like hate read thing with Delia, Delia sub-stack? Occasionally. The one today is sort of an anti, I guess, like downtown dime square screed. And my issue with it is it kept being sort of like, you're going to get old. And it's like, if someone, and there you're going to get old was like 38 or something. And it's like baby is someone who's way on the other side of that age. Like everyone gets old. It doesn't mean that you necessarily like go off to the pasture and are never seen again. Like you're going to turn 38, 40, and you're going to have kids and you also may want to get a drink and be around hot people sometimes. Yeah. Not that I disagreed, but I think people are obsessed with age that haven't been that age. Do you know what I mean? Like, yes, I agree. It has to be the tie in to Gwyneth because it's written by people that are younger or, you know, the idea that someone at that age is having a sexual relationship with Timothy Chalamet used to only be the stuff of my fan fiction. I mean, enjoy. No, it's coming on screen. Not for me. Not for me. The two final things. One is that I love Dalia and I would love to have her on here. That I think that that is an interesting column that is very, it really illustrates the issue we're in media right now because it really needs an editor. Like a lot of great ideas. Yeah. Also people, if they're not using their names, they're not naming names. Like be more specific. Yeah. So yeah, let's get you an editor, Dalia. I have a huge fan. She should come on fashion people soon. But the other thing I just want to say, closing with Miranda July, I went to this Kim Haystrider. Is that how you say her last name? The paper magazine? Founder. I went to a book party that Carla Welch and some other people threw for her at the Chateau on Tuesday night. That was super nice. That's fancy. And they were just like a lot of, it was not like it was just, it was like, because you know Kim is front really friends with a lot of people. I don't know her, but she's really friends with like Carol and Berto were there. It was fun. And I just got to catch up with some people. But Miranda July was there and I was with Rebecca Ramsey who styles her occasionally. And she came over to say goodbye to Rebecca when she was leaving. She was wearing this skirt that was split down the back and she was wearing sheer tights. And like, you could see her whole crack. It was amazing. That's amazing. She looked so good. I was just like, you look, she's incredible, has an amazing sense of style and is who did she write this stuff for? Was it Prada? Was it someone else? That she did work with a brand? Was it Prada? Yeah, she did a campaign that she wrote for Prada. She also did an amazing event Hermes did where she did like a dance at this cool place. The dream. I have been watching her performance since I was in high school because we grew up near each other and grew up in the same sort of like punk house show circuit. So I, she has been a part of like sort of someone that I've watched and vaguely associated with, although not really since, yeah, I think we were both teenagers. She's maybe like two years older than me or something like that. But it's wonderful and wild to see her doing this like Prada stuff and all of that. What a dream. It's fabulous.

On the entire other end of the fashion industry, Sarah Shapiro at Line Sheet did a piece on Friday about the sort of upswing that Brooks Brothers is experiencing. They're seeing like a big uptick in foot traffic. And she kind of looked at why their business was performing well. She talked a lot about shirting and they are most businesses are bottoms are the like, if you ever listened to an American Eagle earnings call, which I'm sure many of you have, they're always like, we're not doing as well in tops, we need to get better in tops. Brooks Brothers is one of the few companies that sort of excels in tops and they have been, but they have a weird, they're owned by like one of these weird brand firms. It's a joint venture and it's, it's, when they were bought by this ABG owns part of them and they're also part of the spark capital, which is, it's convoluted. It doesn't really matter. But anyway, their ownership does not lend itself to brand protection. But I was just curious as someone who is just interested in clothing and Brooks Brothers to me, anytime I talk to a retail executive or a fashion industry executive, it's a brand that people really, really love and care about and they want to succeed. And I was just curious what your relationship with Brooks Brothers is. Have you ever bought anything? Because I feel like we just go to Charvet. I know I'm such an asshole. I, I don't think I've ever bought anything from Brooks Brothers. I grew up with a father that's sort of only wore either like surfer weekend California clothes or Armani suits in the 80s. And there was no in between. And so he was, he's very not preppy. So I didn't grow up in kind of like a Brooks Brothers family. And then by the time I got, I think of the age where I was interested in wearing, you know, shirting and that kind of stuff, tailoring, it all had like lycra and spandex in it. And it was like stretchy and kind of was like glorified and tailor. And I don't know. I have a friend that has their pajamas, but I've walked by them many times and felt very unimpressed. So I was a little bit shocked when I read that story, but I guess I'm not the customer, but I feel like we should be the customer. I would love to buy their shirts. I would love it if they had some very cute suits or something like that. But I don't, I don't think it's there. Yeah. The last time I really looked at it was when Tom Brown was designing a collection and had, they had stores and had a much different ownership structure at that time is much higher. And I know they've done well with like airport shops, that type of thing. But yeah, I mean, I think my dad also was, my dad was preppy in that he was like very into Ralph Lauren, but it was like 80s hipster preppy. So he was not, he grew up in Ohio and was not going to that like one store in Ohio that has air mess ties or whatever. He wasn't doing that. He was, he was really into fashion, but not, it was more fashion. It wasn't like, I'm sure he read the preppy handbook, but it wasn't like he was trying to aspire to that sort of East Coast preppy. He was wearing like track shorts and Ralph Lauren polos and pie. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he has amazing style. He still dresses really, really well. But like speaking of great in Carter, you know, I think it's like around the kind of him moving to work for time Inc in New York era. And he, you know, one of the first thing he does is getting like a Brooks Brothers charge card or something like that, you know, yeah, yeah, before he graduated to Anderson Shepard. Exactly. Yes. So that wasn't, my dad wasn't that far. And he also was like working in Rito at that time and like wearing lots of suits and probably had like one Armani and all of that. Like it was like very, he was in, he was into fashion fashion. I definitely get it from him. But, but yeah, I think that is the challenge when it's owned by these sort of generic companies. It's hard for me to believe the hype. Like, yeah, they have higher foot traffic because they have tons of stores in like these shitty malls now. And so maybe that's enough. I mean, you look at, I always think about this company, untuck it, the success that they have and you're like, who would buy a shirt from a place that's called untuck it? Like it's just, it's so crazy to me. But then I am reminded many times over that most people do not have. And it's not even that they, they don't have good taste. They don't have taste because they are not interested or encouraged or want to put any time into that. So I don't know. And the one thing that Sarah said that I thought was really fascinating was the fact that like women were buying a lot of the men's shirts, which is understandable. And I thought maybe I would try that. But like, I also don't have to, I own a bunch of Charvet shirts that aren't that much more expensive. No, I know, especially because you can still get them secondhand. I also think I forget what the stats are, but what is the percentage of women who still, of like wives who buy all their husbands clothing? I mean, it's like 50% of men don't buy their own clothes, which is probably the scariest statistic that haunts me in the world. But I think, you know, if you're a woman buying clothes for a man, and as we've talked about before, the department store is dwindling, you go somewhere like Brooks Brothers, you know the name, maybe it's in a mall near you, you can buy some stuff for yourself at the same time. Maybe that's the sort of, you know, easy entry. It's a name that you recognize that connotes quality, whether or not the quality is really there. It just to me, it's like, wouldn't those people just go to J Crew at this point? It's just an interesting... I agree. But I don't know. I just bought my stuff from the first thing from like the new Gap. Oh, me too. What'd you get? That's so funny. I got a navy t-shirt and I got Hillary Kerr recommended. It's a tank that's like a ringer tank. So it's navy with white around it. And then I got my Q&A. That's very cute. That's very cute. A bunch of shorts. Yes, exactly. I don't have a navy t-shirt that doesn't have like stains on it. So I needed it. Also, I realized I don't look good in navy. I don't think that's true. I look better in black. Interesting. It really washes me out in a way that I didn't realize until about like three months ago. I think I look better in navy, but it doesn't stop me from wearing black all the time. I'm a New Yorker. Yeah. Yeah, I wore navy. I wore head to dough navy on Saturday. I just wore a lot of blush. Beautiful. So one other thing I wanted to chat with you about because you are a beauty reporter, among other things, is this 13 loon, this thing that's going on with the CEO and co-founder, Niako Greco, who is facing, there's a civil lawsuit in California. She's being accused of fraud and embezzlement. The lawsuit says she used over $165,000 of funds on personal expenses, including Taylor Swift concert tickets, cosmetic treatment, stuff like that. Sarah wrote about this on Friday because she pulled out the very specific things, which was the interesting, to me, was what she actually spent the money on. But I've had a lot of conversations with people. To me, the thing that stood out is like, it wasn't that much money. I don't know how many of you listening, no founders or are founders. But I know people that spend a lot of stuff on a lot of stuff. I was surprised that it got to the point where she was sued. I agree. Also, and again, I'm not good at accounting or bookkeeping, but I would think that a lot of that could theoretically be justifiable as product development expenses. Or I don't know, am I crazy? I'm not saying that what she did was right. It just seems weird that she was flagged for these things that are so relatively close to what her job is. It's not like she's spending it on seeking arrangements or cars. We can't say what is right or wrong. We will let the law speak for itself. Absolutely. I always let the law speak for itself. But what I would say, the other thing is that it's unfortunate. Look, I think anytime you build a business based on something that isn't just the product is really great, it's a challenge. 13 Loons' idea was they were going to highlight black and brown brands, which I think is really noble because, A, there are a lot of black and brown entrepreneurs in the beauty space that need funding. You just pop on over to 15% pledge and you hear, you can find all about it. Aurora James does a great job at highlighting those people and making sure they're getting money because it's really hard if you're a woman or especially if you're a woman of color to get any kind of fundraising. These are brands that need to exist. I think it's a very valid and important idea. But I think the challenge is, and this is a thing, anytime we're talking about a marginalized group and culture, what you want to do is make it so that, no, they are just a part of the culture. They are just on Sephora shelves. They are available to everyone and you're not othering them. And I think the problem is something like 13 Loons. That's why the success of something like Ami Kole is so good, where it's just a great beauty brand who's part of their story is that they have a black founder and that their products are really made for women with melanated skin. But also, but kind of first and foremost, beyond that or next to it, is that the products are beautiful and great and look cool and are easy to find and anyone should love them. And I think that that maybe is the problem when you get into that kind of like gold rush of people wanting to cash in on social responsibility or something, where you wonder how far that kind of commitment went. It's easy to start feeling very, I don't know, pessimistic or at least something about all of it. Yeah, we're in a weird time because it's like a lot of anti-woke culture and woke backlash or whatever. And a lot of these things that were really progressive that needed to happen weren't executed in the best way. And so now it is sort of all falling apart. But there's always another bend in the road and hopefully whatever happens with this case, this person can move on. Yeah, it's also just sad that it's so relatively low stakes when you know that there are horrors being committed by many men in power of much larger companies and they face no such backlash as this. I wish that the spotlight was elsewhere. That is exactly it. So on a better note, I thought I know you wanted to chat about, first of all, a friend of mine is texting three stores in Soho where you can get cocktail dresses. I said, Louisa Villaroma, La Garcione. And then what's that store that that April woman or used to be a stylist owns that has like Karen Callahan type vibe and B-side jeans and stuff. Ouroboros? Yes. Yes. Is there any other stores that you think like? Like multi-brand? It could be. This person is not going to buy a Prada dress. So it needs to be it needs to be like a mid, I said Louisa Villaroma for the higher end. Yeah, Louisa Villaroma is a little expensive. I would probably pop into like Totem. Oh yeah. Oh, this person is not Totem. They're not Totem. I'm going to say Ghani. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I think I then I would also say they're probably not going to buy anything at La Gar Sun. True. But true. And I like La Gar Sun. I find the in shopping experience there to be abysmal. It's awful. They're so rude, higher and nicer people. They're so rude. They're so rude. And then they also I've literally shown them pictures of things on their website and they said that they don't carry that brand. So the worst part is and this is not their fault. They're not it. I'm sure it's hard because you don't have it's hard to know how many people to employ. But like on Sundays there, it's really busy. They need more people. Like once I was like, can I try on these seven things? And they were like, yes, it'll take us about a half an hour to go get them. Oh, I've been there. We're the only person in there and they take half an hour and they act like I'm a peasant in from the sticks who's never bought, you know, doesn't know how to buy clothes. Yeah, their warehouse seems to be like four blocks away. It's not. But that's what the vibe that they give you. You're a store then figure it out. It's annoying. It's annoying. If you want me to shop in person to things, then like make the experience not excruciating. Maybe she should go to like desert vintage and try some vintage stuff. That's not a terrible idea. I'm telling her. Okay, that's enough. So what are you shopping for for summer? Yeah, for me, it's aspirational at this point because the weather has not caught up, but it's all I can think about. I just bought a few things from Attersy, Isabelle Wilkinson's brand that I'm, do you, I forget, do you wear stuff from them? Do you have stuff? I do. I really like it and think she does an incredible job. I find that I end up cycling it out. And it's not because it's not good. I love that satin sort of work jacket she did. I really want to get that. Hepworth. But I, yes, I just feel like I haven't bought the right things for me, maybe. Maybe you need to go to the showroom and like really try everything on. That's what I did. Yeah, yes. But the stuff that I do have, I also have the cashmere blend jacket that's, it's like a barn jacket, but doesn't have a contrasting collar, but it's that style jacket in a cashmere navy. And I wear that. Her fabric, yeah, I'm like a real textiles person and they're so beautiful. I got a knit sort of like silk blend knit navy dress, t-shirt dress that I sized up. So it's a little more like loose. Amazing. I got a really good shirt dress. I got a cashmere silk t-shirt and I got a sarong skirt. I've like never met a sarong skirt I didn't love and this one is really cute. So I'm excited. It's very your style and it's also you go on haul on proper holidays and that's where you need a sarong skirt. But also I live in New York where it's genuinely so hot for months and you know, I want to wear something to dinner that's not like a tank top. Yeah, I was thinking about that this week that because so many of my friends are out of town in July and August and are like, you guys can stay at our place, but I don't want to be there during that period because it's so hot and it's so lovely in California and July and August that why would I want to experience that? See, I really love it. I love the hot weather, but I think that's because I didn't grow up with it. Yeah, I like the I'm fine with 90, but I need it to be dry, dry, understandable. So yeah, it's not I don't really have, you were asking me what I we're going to Tokyo on our vacation on our spring break. I'm not gonna I'm gonna go to Oralee. I'll probably buy something at Oralee. Oh, I might need you to I might put in a PO for your Oralee. Please, please, I'll let you know when I'm going. Yeah, we can make sure you're awake and we can do do the because it's much more affordable. I know this is my favorite kind of friendship is when you send someone live updates from like the Dries mansion in Antwerp or whatever. Oh, it's so great. I prefer the Dries store in Paris, to be honest. I do too. But the Antwerp one is very it was kind of like getting a yeah, it's like getting a special passport stamp or something like that. I feel like I really paid my due. Do you know where the Dries store is going to be in New York? I don't. I think they might be opening a proper store and then also a beauty fragrance, beauty and I just want to know where it is. I bet they'll do one uptown one downtown. That would be if if I were them. I know, but they're going to start with one. My guess is they'll start downtown downtown. But who knows? Who knows? I think they're very driven by architecture. That's like the row. So it will depend on like the one in LA was the former opening ceremony and it was a really cool. It's a really cool special. I know all that Warren would it was like Charlie Chaplin's dance studio, practice studio or some I've heard that story a gazillion times. Cool. But yeah, I'm not I don't I'm trying to think of what I'm buying. I'm going to buy for summer. I think I'm going to need some new. I just got I ordered some shorts from that brand Spence. We had Amanda on last week. Last Friday. Yeah. They're and they're the men's because and Amanda and I discussed this. I have a real issue with baggies. Generally, they just do not. I hate this word, but they're not flattering on me. Also, they just don't really fit. Like I always am adjusting them. Are they flattering on anyone? I don't know. But I but I would say that I just don't feel comfortable in them. And these are great because they're elastic in the back, but they have a flat front and they also I got they're they're men's sizing. But I feel like I'll wear them a lot this summer. And I usually I just have like a bunch of track shorts from Amazon. Yeah, are these like nylon? I wore a lot of lacrosse shorts last summer. Oh, yeah. Which I think will continue into this summer. No, these are like a hard fabric, a tech fabric that's woven. So it's very it feels I can wear them out and about. They're not too long. They're not too short. They feel like I could tuck a shirt in and it wouldn't look weird. I like them. But I tend to I mean, it is challenging because like I want to do a high sport preorder right now. And I'm just like, I don't need anything else because I only wear stuff when I go in LA, I go out a couple nights a week. But I don't I wear jeans when you go out a lot. See, I don't. But then I'm often then the most dressed up person at all time or whatever. Yeah. And I went to a dinner at I went to dinner at the Bel Air Hotel last Tuesday for that jewelry thing at present. And again, all of these things you're going to an LA to sound very glamorous to me. Well, this one I dressed up. I wore old Celine pants. I wore a Saint Laurent 80s shirt and I wore my new Phoebe Philo blazer. And I did dress up for that. But also, but generally, I tend to just wear jeans and a blazer. And and on Saturday, I did a live taping of fashion people at Design Space. Oh, yeah. How was that? And what did you wear? It's good. I wore a navy Charvet sweater, a pair of high sport navy pants, a pair of like hot red heels from Bali that I got on my trip. Oh, yes. I saw I saw the picture because I got the sandal version. Oh, yeah, fun. Yes. Yes. And then I wore it was cold yesterday, Saturday in LA. So I wore a Prada over like overcoat type thing. But it was fun because it was fun to dress up. And then I just like changed into slides afterwards. But what you change into slides? Isn't that like a one and a half, two inch heel? Or is it? It wasn't that high, but I just felt too dressy because then we went we walked or we went for coffee with my good friend, Phil. And then we went, I went to Maxfield and I was like, I feel too, you know, how people dress like they wear these like disgusting no, I know, they're wearing the puffy sweats. I know they're wearing like, like bad, oh, fancy sneakers. I know LA is awful. Some people look amazing in LA, but almost everyone looks awful. Crazy. That strip of West Hollywood up on Melrose where the the verb and like John Elliott and Totem and Maxville are people just look truly, truly horrific. And if I had to, every time I go there, I think if this is all I did, I couldn't live here because they look so bad. And when I was in Maxfield, which was super busy and has literally every single brand, they have Mew Mew, they have Gucci, they have Fiji, they have everything. It's crazy. And it was very, very busy. They're like the pursch lifers of LA. Exactly. But this, this group of people came in as we were leaving and they all had on and this is, I was interviewed for this L UK story about what the look of the 2020s is going to be. And I said black top and light colored jeans. Oh, yeah. Every person. Yeah. The bonanza of girls in the West Village wearing them. Yeah. This group of people, men and women, family, some sort of the half of them must have been related. Lots of very groomed eyebrows, like very groomed. Still wearing them thick. Yeah. And they all had on some version of this. And I was like, we have to leave. We need to go. We need to get to Hollywood. I cannot be over here. But it's a very, I don't know, East Side of LA has its own terrible, reprehensible uniforms too, in the same way. But the thing is like, there are other pockets of, I was in Beverly Hills yesterday, I went to the Blue Bottle up on, I believe it's on, I don't even know what street, Beverly Drive up by, oh, South Beverly. It's right by South Beverly Grill. That area, everybody's just like normal. And we, I was with my friend, we actually walked from there to the writer's guild theater for the Graydon thing. And that area is fine. There's like pockets of areas where you're like, okay, everybody looks, I love Larchmont. Not everyone is like beautifully dressed, but like, it feels normal. Yeah. This is why I'm not an LA person. It's all too close to my cursed childhood. I just, yeah, no. As long as I don't have to go to that area a lot, I'm okay. But it really, I was like, we, I need to leave. Because I cannot engage with this type of person at this point in my life willingly, not just for work. Yeah. So that was my, that's my recent shoppings. Marissa, we talked for a long time. Is there anything else? I know. Is there anything else? You know, I was chatting with Stelene because they hired our friend, Alisa. And she was saying, the three of us should have dinner next time I'm in New York or drink or something. Yeah, I can't wait. I just did a piece for my first piece for El Decor on the decorator, Julia, Julie Hillman's home, which I'm ready to move into. But yeah, I'm excited for what she's going to do with El Decor. I am excited too. Good. Congrats to Alisa. Let's keep Karats. It couldn't happen to a better person. I'm certainly pronouncing her name, last name wrong. But you know, when you do that for the first time. Marissa, it was great to catch up. Congrats on almost being done with the book. I can't wait to discuss it in the fall. And I will everyone will have galleys soon enough. I hope. Can't wait. We'll talk soon. Bye. Bye. Fashion People is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck.

It was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll, and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out. It was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself?
