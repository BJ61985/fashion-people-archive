His legendary runs at Harper's Bazaar in Allure, Living in Los Angeles, and so much more. This is a great one. So let's get started. Hey, everyone. It's Lauren. Before we get going, I wanted to remind you that if you like this podcast, you'll definitely love Puck where I send an email three times a week called Line Sheet.

I hope you're somewhere not too warm. The news never stops in fashion, apparently. I got a text at like 1 a.m. on Wednesday morning, which I was obviously asleep. I'd been asleep for hours, but I had gotten up to get a glass of water. It was about the Supreme News, and I just went back to sleep. It was a nice thing about not working at a breaking news organization. I don't have to get up and post. I did cover the Sunglass Company, El Solor, Luxotica's $1.5 billion purchase of Supreme in Wednesday's issue of Line Sheet, where Rachel Sturgats also has a fascinating behind-the-scenes story of what's happening at Estee Lauder. I'm following it so closely and loving everything Rachel has to say. You should definitely check it out. Very quickly on Supreme, Jacob Gallagher is slated to come on the pod on Tuesday, so we should get more into it. If he doesn't show up, it's not my fault, but I think you will. But I'd say that for Supreme, this is probably the close to the best possible scenario of what was going to happen. VF Corp was going to sell it no matter what, and I think El Solor will probably leave Supreme alone for the time being, which is what they really need. So we'll talk about it more next week, but weirdly, there was also this news on Thursday morning that Metta may take a stake in El Solor, Luxotica. So let's see what happens there. I should probably write something bigger on this, but it's definitely connected to the opportunity and wearables. My husband actually just bought a pair of those Ray-Ban Metta sunglasses. El Solor owns Ray-Ban, and he really likes them. So more on that soon. Elsewhere, I had one quick fact-checking thing. A loyal fashion people listener wanted to make sure I knew that dresses at Zara were not $300. I looked it up, okay, they are more like $100. There is a $160 dress, but I think the reason, the point I was making is that the quality of a Zara dress is probably as high if not higher as a tuck or not dress, which was what Becky and I were talking about on the last episode. Because of the volume at which Zara produces and they're vertically integrated, the product quality is actually pretty high. So in my mind, they should be $300. So I apologize for that. But these things happen. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this interview with Paul. I've been wanting to meet him for years to talk about the early days of KCD, the PR firm he started with Kija Keeble and John Duka. It's a really amazing story. We barely get into it, but we do talk about them a bit. And I really hope someday someone writes a book on it. I do not have the time, but someone needs to do it. We discussed that, but so much more. His time at Harbour's Bazaar, Vogue, Allure, just the state of the industry. I hope you enjoy it and have a great weekend. Paul Cavacco, welcome to Fashion People. Hi, Lauren Shannon. Thanks for having me. I am so excited to have you. You probably don't know this, but my obsession, and we can get into this, is someone writing a book about KCD. Maybe it should just be you or yes. So we'll talk about it, but you loom large in my mind for many reasons, but I'm so happy to have you on today. That's so funny because KCD, it's funny. It was such a, because it was, you know, Ridgid, Cable, Cavaco and Duka, and it was not that long. Yes. And it was like a baby PR company. And then it turned into this mammoth fabulous that, you know, Ed Filippowski and Julie Manion turned it into with Rallish. We got to get into it. But the first question that we always ask on our Friday episode is, what did you have for breakfast? It's pretty early in LA. So have you eaten anything yet? No, I had breakfast. Same. I've been up since five. What did you have? So I went to Starbucks and had the egg bites. They're really good. I love them. They're really, really good. And I'm trying not to eat them anymore because I'm sure they're like loading the calories. No, as someone who looks at that stuff way too closely, they're actually really good for you. It's a great breakfast. Lots of protein. They're under. Even the richer ones with bacon are under 300 calories. That's actually a perfect breakfast. If you're going to eat breakfast, I had to get up early and drive my Jeep. Oh yeah. Because now that I live in LA, I have to drive. So I have a little tiny Jeep that looks like color and olive green. My daughter maybe get that color. She thought it was being nice. Yeah. My daughter had white cars. So it was like, no, no, we have to get that. We've had either white or black cars. So that's when you, when you bought your car because I only moved LA. When did you move to LA? What year? Okay. During the pandemic, like 2000, we moved here in 2020. Neither of us had ever, my husband nor I had ever driven. And we got our license about beach. Got our licenses like three months into it. And but buying the car to me was very much like it reminded me about of buying shoes at Bergdorf where you go and you look at all the shoes and they all kind of look pretty much the same, but there's something slightly different. Whether it's you prefer one brand over the other, their runway style or, or there's a slight aesthetic difference. And so we really spent a lot of time and finally our dream was like an 80 sob. But now that I know, I can't drive, I need to drive a modern car, but we, we ended up going with a Volvo in denim blue. And then my husband recently got a Volvo station wagon in Hunter green. That's like circa 2000, but I, I've driven it once. I need, I need all the sensors and stuff. But I feel like did you, did you have a car when you were in New York or? No, I have at different times have had cars, you know, like, cause we used to, you know, like when I was married to Kylie's mom, my daughter's mom, we had a house out in Sag Harbor on a shelter island. So we had what car did you have back then? We had, we bought a used Mercedes that was blue. And my daughter's mother, who is Kiesha Keeble, who was a fashion editor under Diana Vreeland, was like, Oh no, no, we have to, we have to paint, get it painted white because you cannot have a blue car sitting in your driveway. So we had a white, so they painted it white because the blue car had the Palomino color. That to me is just one of those things that people don't think like that anymore and they should. When my daughter had her kids, we used to drive the kids to school and she had a white car, which I forget what it was. It's like a white, you know, I would have been interested in like a bisque color BMW. We actually have an occasional babysitter who she moonlights as a babysitter. She's an interior designer who has one that's really great. I really wanted a vintage car. I wanted like Sage Green Mercedes, circa 1980 or something like that. But the reality, yeah. Aren't you happy? Yes. You need, I need the GPS, you know. I need to know where, because I have no idea where I'm going here. So why did you move out here to be closer to your family or? Yeah, my daughter's, my son-in-law got off, his lawyer and got offered a job here to open an office in LA. And he, so my daughter was like, you know, we know what, I know our life is in New York, but let's see what it's like in LA. And so they moved here and I've never been separated from my daughter and never separated from my grandchildren. And so I thought I would be going back and forth working. And then the pandemic happened and, you know, and then I just moved here and didn't even, so my apartment in New York. How are you finding it? Because you grew, you were born and raised in New York, right? Born in, yeah, I'm born in Manhattan. My daughter and I are actually born in the same hospital, strangely. But I was born in the poor ward. She was born not in the poor ward. She was in life, how life changes. But yeah, it's, you know, it's fine. I'm not used to it. I'm used to walking out of my house, my apartment and going anywhere you want, getting in the subway, going to the corner and getting food, going to get a cup of coffee, not thinking about like if you didn't buy groceries, you know, you can, you know, you know, it's, you have to be planet more and it's not my nature. I feel similarly, I worked, I lived in New York for 15 years and I'm very much a city person, but loved LA and always kind of thought it would probably be where we retired. And then, yeah, or I wanted to try to have my kid in New York and see how we felt about it. And then a friend of mine always says, you either moved to the suburbs or you moved to LA. And we were not going to move to the suburbs. So we were like, if we don't like being in New York with a kid, if it's too stressful, and I was already stressed out by New York, like I wanted to leave. We thought about moving to Paris, actually. And then the pandemic happened and we used to spend every August in LA because it's hot here, but it's dry heat. And so we just decided, we were like, well, how are we going to do our LA trip? And this condo basically in Silver Lake popped up that was the mortgage was a thousand bucks a month cheaper than our rent in Bed-Stuy. And so we were like, let's just do it. I worked in business and fashion at the time and they were all in London. They're like, fine, you want to get over 5.30 every day? Do whatever you want. But the thing is, and we moved here and then I got pregnant and have a kid. And having a kid here is amazing. And I love coming home to here. I'm sure you know Siddhartha Shukla. Yeah, yeah. So he was in town and we had him over for dinner on Sunday. And he was like, I can't believe you live here. Like it's just we live on a hill in a mid-century. I mean, it's like, you would ever, like it's fine. But he's just like, I can't believe this is your life. And the thing is, I don't, it doesn't feel like my life. Like when I'm in New York, that feels like my life. And this is sort of this weird thing of I don't want to leave. Like I was always trying to leave New York here. I'm so excited to come home to Los Angeles. But it doesn't, it doesn't feel real to me because of the fact that like you drive everywhere. You can't, even when we were in Silver Lake, we ended up leaving there because I was carting around my seven month old on Glendale. And there would be like a homeless person, naked homeless person running down the street. And I was like, oh, I guess we can't. So now we basically live in the suburbs. It's really, it's interesting because it's a really unique special place. But if you're a New York, you're a New Yorker, you're a city person. It's just a completely different lifestyle. And I think impossible to ever totally get used to, especially if you go back to New York, a decent amount. Yeah. Now I don't go back to New York that often. So it's fine. And it's just, I guess in the end, it's, you know, home is where your family is. So to me, it doesn't really like there's things I don't love about LA. There's I love the weather. I love, you know, I mean, I don't mind driving. I'm not a great driver, but I don't mind driving. But I like seeing my family every day. And so that, you know, it's like I didn't want to miss my grandchildren growing up. It's like I stopped when I was doing, you know, when I was, when I was freelance before I became an editor. And just before we, you know, when we started Keeble, Kavako and Duka, I stopped traveling and stopped styling because I wanted to watch my child grow up. And I thought, if you're going to have a kid, you might as well watch them grow up. Well, tell me about that. Tell me about your, your early career and how you became a fashion editor. One of the most legendary. Not really, but it's true. It's true. So what happened was I was, you know, young, like I was in my very, very early 20s. And I met Kizya Keeble and, you know, we lived together. We ended up having, you know, a baby. And she had been, she had worked at Kandina. She had worked originally at Glamour in the 60s. And then for Diana Vreeland, she was the youngest sittings editor. And editors that did shoots were called sitting editors then because, you know, in the beginnings of Vogue, the very rich woman would come and sit for the photographers to have their portraits done. So the editors, we were all called sitting editors. Which is such a funny expression. But anyway, that was the expression. And she was a sitting editor for Diana Vreeland. She worked with Avedon, Penn, you know. And then she went freelance, which was a weird thing to do in the 70s. And she worked freelance for Vogue. And I had met her. We were living together. She, you know, she got pregnant when we eventually got married. And I stood, I actually, before we got when we were just living together, I had gone to us, to college, and I thought that I wanted to be a writer. And I thought, and she said, well, if you could be a writer, you have to write about something. You can't just, you know, it's not random. You can't just, and I was like, OK, maybe, you know, since you know about fashion, I should write about fashion. So I started, she was had like a little PR company freelance. And I would do the press releases. And then she, someone offered her a job at Esquire to do fashion. And she had to use real people. And so the second shoot was supposed to be college kids. And I was just out of college. So it had to be real people. So she sent me to the photographer. And he like, you know, to be one of the models. And he'd like took pictures of me and he said, yes, I'll use them. And of course, I didn't realize that he knew that I was her boyfriend. So that's really why he used me. But also everybody that was in it. We're also just out of college. And one was Woody Hawkshwender. And Woody Hawkshwender ended up being a writer. He was a bike mechanic in Central Park. He was a friend of ours. And he ended up being one of the... He was a New York Times writer eventually. But we were both in it. And they were all like, everybody was six foot tall, except me, because I'm very short. And they used me like the foil in the picture. I was the person always laughing. We had to carry instruments. They all had like trumpets and stuff. And I carried a giant bass fiddle all around. We did it on Yale's campus. So anyway, so that's how it's... And the photographer was Bruce Weber. And he said, you know, Tequilla, this guy's really good at putting clothes together. And then I was a waiter at a place called Brew Burger on 57th and 6th, which was a burger with all the beer you could drink. And he would call me up and say, I want you to come style something. So that's how I became a menswear stylist. At that time, what was the word stylist even used? I know you mentioned sittings editor, but just generally was that word used? It was the beginning of stylist. Stylists really were... You were either a fashion editor at a magazine or a lot of the times the ads were done by... The stylist was the studio manager. Or if the photographer worked for a magazine, he would have one of the editors sneak. Do the ads, but not be known, because they weren't supposed to do that. But I know they did it. And at the time, did Bruce already have a real aesthetic and his style, was it as developed or was it he's still sort of figuring it out? It was a very, very, very beginning of his career, like the very, very beginning. He was just starting to work for GQ. He hadn't worked for Vogue. He hadn't worked for a... So it was really just menswear. And when you're working with a photographer, like especially when you all were early in your careers, do you feel like the stylist and the photographer relationship? Because this is all about image making, which is the way I think about it now when I look at the roster at Art & Commerce or our partner or whatever. Do you feel like a lot of those photographers had deep relationships with stylists who they collaborated with? Or was it usually the photographer leading? Like how did that work for you in your career and what else you observed? I think always because it's an image. It's a photograph. So it's the photographer in the end. I think what you do is... And I think this happened throughout my entire career because as the editor, as the stylist, you talk to the photographer and you come up... Someone comes up with it first. Whoever gets the job, the booking, is the... So they'll call and say, okay, we're doing Versace. And it would be like in the case of Avedon, Avedon would just tell me that we were doing Versace. And I would just turn up at the studio and then I would find out what we were doing. It was not... Don't forget we didn't have the internet. So people didn't have references. They weren't able to print out things and show you things. Say, I would like to do this. I would like to do that. So people would describe things to you. They'd say, did you ever see the movie Conformist? And you'd go, yes. And then they'd talk about how they wanted to do a shoot based on this. But it's their interpretation of something they've seen. You can't go on the internet to see other stills of it. So then you would do your interpretation of what they told you. Then you would talk to the hair and make a person. They'd do their interpretation. By the time you took the picture, it was a whole other thing. But it was based on something. Each spring, 23 Pulitzer Prizes are rewarded for distinguished journalism, books, drama, and music. It was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll, and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize-winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out. It was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10. Follow and listen on Apple Podcasts, the Odyssey app, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcast. What was it like to call in clothes at that time? Because I assume there weren't fashion showrooms like KCD has where there's like a set of samples that you can just grab. You know, if you worked for a magazine, they just sent you the clothes. You know, or you went to, like if it was in America, you would just go to the office and they would have their, you know, the market editor would choose the clothes and then you'd choose from that. And the rest was advertising. And if there was very, you know, you would have to call, you would have to have a relationship with the PR person at the house, you know, so you would call Ralph Lauren or you would call, you know, like you'd call our floor and you spoke to Kelly Klein, who was doing the PR at that time. You know, so that's who you spoke to her, her name was Kelly Rector at the time. So you would talk to her, you know, and you have a relationship with them. So it wasn't that different, but you just, it wasn't like, you know, you didn't go to one place and get a lot of designers all at once. Who were the designers that people were like really going gaga over or clothes that you were really excited to shoot early in your career? I think Calvin, Klein, Ralph, Lauren. For me, you know, those were the ones I really, you know, and then there was like Willie Smith, who was a young designer, which was adorable. So, you know, and then when the late 70s, early 80s, was like Comne Gasson or Yoji, you know, I wasn't really into high fashion, you know, like, you know, it wasn't like La Croix or anything like that for me, you know, because I think we would do, because I was working a lot with, you know, Bruce Weber, Steve and Micell, you know, and so it was a little grittier the pictures we were doing. We were working for, you know, Italian magazines. Willie Smith, there was an incredible, I don't know if you got to see it, the Cooper Hewitt, an incredible exhibit, probably the best fashion exhibit I've ever seen. Really? It was remarkable. Like, it was just done so well. I forget the curator's name, she's really great. I don't know if she works full time for them or not, but it was remarkable. Did you work with him directly on anything, on shows or anything like that? We worked on one of his shows, and Steve and Micell at the time was a illustrator at Women's Wear Daily. And he, we got introduced to him. We had met Anna Sweth, we're a friend of ours, and she's very good friends with Steve and Micell, and she was like, you have to get my friend, Steven, to do these photographs with you. So, you know, we started to work with Steven, and Willie Smith called us and asked us to do his show, and we did the Prescott with Steven. And it was completely, the Prescott's really adorable, and in the show is Whitney Houston as a model. I wonder if there are any videos on YouTube. I'm sure some of this stuff was in this show. I wonder if there's a book to go with the exhibition. I'll look for it. But what an amazing time. And the other thing is, you mentioned LeCouomb, but there was just so much going on in American fashion, I guess, with the rise of ready-to-wear and sportswear and America being the sort of center of that. It must have been such an exciting time to work in fashion. The industry was smaller. Like, we'd go to shows that some, I would go to shows I wasn't even invited to. You'd just turn up and you would be sitting in a showroom, and you would sometimes, you know, because I wasn't an editor or anything, you know. So, I would be sitting next to the sewing machine in the, so they would walk through the entire showroom, into the pattern-making room, and that's what the girls would do, except if it was Halston, you just, you had that long. But I remember coming from, I worked, remember, I worked in a place called Brewer Burger, and I don't know if you've ever worked in a restaurant. I haven't. I never could get hired. I always did retail. Okay, so you smell like the restaurant when you leave. Yeah. And I got seated next to Grace Marabella, who at the time was the editor-in-chief of Vogue Magazine, and there I was in smelling like a burger and beer, sitting next to her. And they just sat you down somewhere. So, it was kind of great, you know. So, everything was smaller. So, how did you end up, as you mentioned, KCD, Keeble, Kivako, Duka? KCD is one of the biggest PR and events and strategy fashion firms in the world, and has been for several decades. But you founded this company, and the, to me, the two things I remember from early days of KCD are the Steven Sprouse stuff, and then also, because Julie, I remember at one place, I worked, Julie did a story with them about the early, one of the big Steven Sprouse shows, or an early Steven Sprouse show, and then also, Shara Vari, which to me is like this thing. I never got to see this store on the Upper West Side that seems like it was the best store in the world. And I interviewed Ed Philipowski, probably now, about 10 years ago, I did a piece on him for Business of Fashion, and he talked about, I think he did the PR for them and sent you all flowers, or you did the PR for them, but he sent you flowers when you got the account or something, and that's how he ended up interning for you or something like that. He never interned, he did that, but his old boss, he worked at an agency type of PR thing, and his boss had met Keisha and said to her, I have someone who I think would be great. He came in, spoke to Keisha, and she literally hired him on the spot. And then he just came to work and he ran. We didn't really know that much about doing PR. We had started it to be an advertising agency because we had been styling for years, and people would call her all the time and ask her, who should we use to shoot this? She said, why am I giving out all this information? And then I just get paid a little fee to do the styling when I put together the whole thing. So she said, I think we should do this. And I was like, whatever you want to do, because I was like, she was the lead. I was like, okay, if we want to do it, we're going to do it. And then at the time we were divorced and she had remarried John Ducca, who was a writer for the Times. And he was like, I want to do this with you. So he thought, great, he can do the writing. He can do all the press releases. And he had to quit the Times, right? Because he married her. Well, not because he married because we decided to do this business. Oh, okay. Because I remember there was a great story and everyone should look it up on the cut about John Ducca that talked about, it had the note that he had to send the Times being like, I'm doing, I guess I'm starting this agency or whatever and I'm marrying Keesha. And it was like all too many conflicts of interest or something like that, which I thought was really interesting. When Linda Wells started Allure, she called, she said, well, you know, I'll have Kebukwako and Ducca do it. So she called me in and I went with Ed, I think. And she explained to us, you know, what the Allure was going to be. And she said, can you do this PR? And I said, I don't know how to do PR for like a magazine that's going to lift the veil and tell the truth about beauty products and they're going to be your advertisers. They're not going to want this. I said, I don't know how to do this. So it's weird that we became, you know, that she and I ended up working together for 16 and a half years. But, you know, so the PR agency was fine, you know, but we didn't know a lot about. So Ed really is the one who knew a lot about PR and really sort of brought these. So Keisha and I knew how to do fashion shows. We knew how to do the press kits. We knew, you know, and Keisha and Ed together were kind of brilliant. You and Keisha just stayed best friends and like, I guess you had a kid together. What was it like running a business with your ex-wife and her new husband? I know it was for a short time, but... Hilariously, we're all fire signs and we're all different. Fire and signs. And people say, what was it like? And I said, it was a lot of door slamming. You know, we were all very emotional. It was actually great. Keisha and I always had a great relationship. The form of the relationship didn't work as a marriage, but as a relationship, it always worked. So that was fine. John and I knew each other long time. So it all kind of worked and we all had different strengths. And so it was fine. It was completely... And we did really different things. What were the 80s like in New York at that time? It must have been a fun time to be starting a new business. Was details started at that point or was that a little bit later? Like, what was the scene like that you all were in? You know, it's funny because don't forget I had a kid. Yeah. And I think that changes a lot of things. So we're in an industry which at the time people were not having children. Yeah. I mean, so Keisha had been offered a job to be the fashion director of Vogue. This was many, many, many years ago. And she had to turn it down because she had found out the week before that she was pregnant. Yeah. So she turned it down. And you know, people... You know, we would take the bait. Our daughter went on all the shoots because she was, you know, she was a nurse throughout, you know. So she would go on all the Vogue shoots, you know. And, you know, but because Keisha was freelance and stuff, but she would come till she was in her teens. She came on shoots. And so I think we didn't go out a lot because we had a kid. Yeah. We went to work and then, you know, but it was a... The great thing was it was small, the industry. Yeah. And so you, you know, so you went to work. Working was very, very like, you know, now you go on set and there's a lot of people on set. On set was the photographer, one or two assistants, the hair, the makeup, the stylist. And sometimes the stylist had an assistant. Hair and makeup didn't have assistants then. I didn't have an assistant. So it would just be, you know, like Steven Meisel, his one or two assistants, Francois Norris, Orbey, and like, you know, Christy Turlington, or, you know, Linda Evangelista. That's all that was there. Would you say, because a lot of times when you talk to people who were working in the 80s and 90s in fashion, they talk a lot about the big budgets for shoots and things. Was this like pre-big budgets? Yeah. And so then it got like when, how, what was the transformation of that sort of bare bones, you all have a job and there's not like all this extra stuff going on around it. What was sort of the transformation from that to this stuff that we hear about now? I think if you worked for magazines and you worked, you know, I worked, I worked at Bazaar, Harpus Bazaar with Lys Tauberis. So that's, we're in the 90s now. And but it just was going on in the end. If you work for, you know, Vogue or Bazaar, they had budgets. So even though the crew was still always small, but you could go somewhere, you could travel for a few days. Like people, I never did it because I had a kid, so I would come home right away. I never traveled. So, you know, if I did, I came home in one day. But people would go for 10 days. They'd go to, you know, they'd go to, so they had a lot of money to do, to spend this way. I did not experience. You know, it's, it's you, this, it's really interesting. When I talk about, I travel a lot and I'm away from my kid. And I think a lot of people's rule that I hear is like three days away, but you, especially being a man, like being a parent was a primary role for you. And that is, it must have been interesting in that era, especially, but even now you, there aren't many people who have that sort of like consistency. I remember listening to Tracy Ellis Ross on fresh air and she said her mom, even if she was away, she had a rule about how, how long she would be away for. And if she was away, they would talk every single night, which I assume is much harder than now when you can do FaceTime anywhere in the world or what have you. But how did you reconcile that at the time? And was there anyone else that you like could bond with over this, this, this being like a big part of your, your actual career too is being a parent? Well, I think when I decided not to travel, did not go over very well. I think a lot of photographers and even, you know, so Kezia died when my daughter was 13 or just turned 13. And then I didn't travel at all. And then two years later I left KCD and went to Bazaar and my deal at Bazaar was if I had to go to the collections, my daughter had to come with me. But my daughter went to all, she went to all the shows, she went, if I had to go to one country, I would go to either Milan or Paris. I had to go to one country and my daughter came for the week. Why did you decide to take that job at Bazaar? It seems obvious now looking back all the iconic covers that you worked on and projects, but what, what made you say yes to that team? I mean, hmm. I think I was heartbroken. So, I mean, I think, you know, Kezia died. You know, my dad had died. Kezia died. Kezia's mother died. All within three years, my whole family disappeared. But when Kezia died, it was, I'm sorry. Oh my God, no, you're our first crier on fashion people. I'm so touched. No, but it was, I couldn't do it anymore. Yeah. It was too difficult. It was too hard to, I only did it because she wanted to do it. Like, I would have never done PR. You know, I don't feel it, you know, but, and I just couldn't do it anymore. I just thought it's, it's, I had, and the opportunity came up, you know, Fabia, I was working on, we were working on the sex book. Madonna sex book. Yeah. And Fabian had been approached by Liz Tobaris. And he had said to, so it was Stephen Mazzalmi, and he said to us, you should come to Bazaar. Stephen was a vogue. I had my company. And I thought about it. And I thought, yeah. And Julie Mannion and Ed Filipowski were really running the business. I was doing a lot of shoots to make extra money. Yeah. They were really running the whole thing. And I could, you know, it was like, I had done so many shows. I didn't want to do shows anymore. And I just thought, okay, you know, and we worked it out. And then I just left and went to Bazaar. And that was, you know, sorry. No, it was amazing. I loved it. Cry the whole time. I don't want to get too deep, but like you have had a lot of loss in your life. Like, and during that period in particular, and then Liz Tobaris, I don't know how close you were with her, but how long did you know her before she was born? How did you know her before she passed? I knew Liz before because she was an editor at before she was before she was the editor in chief of British folks. She was a sittings editor. And we both worked with, you know, Bruce Weber, Patrick DeMarche, Alec Chattelaine. And Liz and I actually, we ended up like sharing clothes one time because we were in the studio with the same photographer. So I had the morning shift and she had the evening shift. And we just, I would just leave the clothes and she would leave things for me. So, so I knew her fairly, you know, not great, but well, but you know, we also, we both had kids, which was an odd thing then. You know, so, and she was the most divine human being in the world. She was adorable. Like, you know, I had a teenager, she had little kids. And we were supposed to have a meeting one time with Donnie Karen that I was supposed to be at. And my daughter being a teenager for the first time did not come home at night. And I was freaking out, but there's no cell phones. So I'm waiting by my phone at home or waiting for her to come home. And finally she comes home, you know, whatever happens, you know, and then, you know, my daughter claims to have been grounded more often. Well, how to go out. I don't know if that's true, but that's the claim. And I go to Bazaar, stick my head in Liz's office. She's with Donna. She stops talking to Donna and doesn't say where were you to her first words to me are is everything okay. And that's so working with her was like that it was you with you as a person were more important than anything that was going to go on. And that is number one number two reason I decided to become a fashion journalist is that magazine. It was so as a, you know, I think I was when she got there was probably a middle school but as a teenager it was really everything to me I just thought this is what fashion really is so inspiring but what was it like to be a part of those shoots. I'm sure you know long one. Well, and when he was he has like old copies he has original copies of that magazine or he had them he passed away a couple years ago but he and he was a Dolce at that time I think and he he would talk about those those covers all the time and and what was it like to be a part of something that now we talk about like there were no references now those those issues are referenced constantly and will be forever because of the access to imagery that we have virtually. It was heaven. That's all I can say it was heaven. We, you know, it was Liz who was a great boss. She had also been a sittings editor so she understood what we had to do. So we were not. I think then even when I went to Vogue and they neither one of them micromanaged us. So you actually had an idea you could do the idea, you explain to them and then do it. So we never got micromanaged we also never you kind of have an idea when you're going on set, but it's going to morph, because it goes through all these, all these different people's filters it goes through the photographer filters the editors filter the hair person the makeup and then how the model interprets what you know bodily interprets it all. You know because that's so you're all collaborating so it's but there was just like everyone wanted to be there. Everyone wanted to be there she was so joyous that it was joyous to be with her. And we were like we had a if you ask anyone from that time period that work there. They'll tell you like, I mean, my daughter was doing something she had a job and for like a bad company and they were giving dinners and she said you should we should give a dinner for all the ex bizarre people. Everyone turned up, because we all wanted to see each other. So, you know, it was the office was hilarious. We had a hilarious time well you know, and she was joyous. It was it was great. I have to say it was a really wonderful experience. I feel like a lot of the people I know who are of your lineage so like, did Sasha turn and Morrison work for you there. Sasha worked for me there and a lot she I just actually it's about to be her birthday. Oh God, I'd not say anything because it's good. She here. But it's about to be her birthday. So yeah, so I just but yeah, she worked there. She's I love her. She's one you know but Sasha Eigelhardt also was there. You know, Mary Bronnick who ended up in Vanity Fair. She talked about the fashion industry being very small when you started out during that period the mid 90s like mid to late 90s when you were there and then at Vogue right like that's when the industry started to really become big and a bigger part of sort of mainstream culture and also business from my perspective that's when I see the consolidation inklings of consolidation starting which is exciting. Could you feel that the stage was getting bigger on in terms of shows in terms of what you all were doing. You know I had gone to shows in the 70s late 70s and then throughout the 80s we were doing producing shows. I never sat in the audience and the first time I sat in the audience really was at when I went to Bazaar. So I never had been to Europe and you know, I'd seated people at shows in Europe but I had never sat in the audience so it was a very different thing. I think I'm very myopic. I didn't notice what was happening because I'm so concentrated on my job so I was there to see the clothes and I didn't understand. You know that it was getting bigger. I thought that's what it was. You know but now if I think about it you can see that it changed at that time period and if the shows start to get bigger they start to be more like you know like you would go to the Goatierre show or the Terry Muglerre show and they were extravaganza's. You know like they were like the Goatierre shows were incredibly beautiful like he did one where it was snowing in like you know it was in Paris in an old. Train station. And it's snowing and the girls came out with candles lit candles in their hair. Like walking down the runway was like insane. What a time. So what what was the difference between the sort of I guess mission or idea behind because you went to Vogue in the late 90s right so like Vogue versus Bazaar at that time because they were they're still very very different magazines and I think they continued to be but they were they were so different. What were what was kind of your what did you set out to do at Vogue versus what you did at Bazaar. Why did you decide to change. I don't know I can get fully into that. I mean I think at the time I was having I was struggling with kind of the mission at Bazaar was changing. I think initially what our thing was was Vogue was very specific at that time and it was starting to be more commercial for some odd reason. And we were like you know we don't have to do that. You know we don't have you know and neither and neither Tony or I we had both worked for Vogue freelance and we'd worked for like European vote. Tony Goodman. Yeah Tony Goodman and so we had and Fabien had worked for Italian Vogue and so I think we took a and Liz was from British but so we took a much more European approach to fashion. However the strange thing was that Tony and I are both really American. It's very true. And so I think the mix of the way Fabien did the layouts and who the photographers were who we worked with and the freedom we had turned out in a very different magazine than Vogue. And I think you know both Peter and Patrick Peter Limburg and Patrick Tomache had worked for American folks so they. They wanted it to look more like their work in Europe. So they were doing that really for us. And so you know it was not. You know and we didn't pay attention to like we paid attention to the advertisers but not in the same way. And you know I. So I think I got there. I was there for four years and then I was having I was struggling a little bit with what was going on. And I always think if you can't align with what's going on you have to leave. You know what I mean. It's not like I couldn't change anything. And I just thought it's time to go without getting into it just like the politics of that magazine in particular at that time or not. Yeah because you know because if they all have a pop you know magazines all have politics because it's you know there's always a point where the advertising is not so strong. So you know they want you to start changing things and I was not you know I probably I didn't I couldn't agree on how we should be moving forward. And I thought OK I think it's time to move on. I was going to go freelance and then you know Steve and myself because we're friends so I told him I was thinking of leaving. He told Grace Cunnington. She told Anna Wintour Anna Wintour called me. I went and had an interview and you know I took the job. What was your title there and like how did you work with Grace. I was the fashion director. Grace was the creative director. Got it. OK. I did my real job there was kind of what to wear with what. Got it. You know I did all the clothes that nobody wanted to shoot. You did the real the real stuff. I did the real clothes. I always do real clothes. I mean that's I'm sort of based somehow in reality because I feel like you can do the fantastical in real clothes because people dress normally. You know. And so it's like can you have an exciting life and look normal. So that was you know and you know I think having a kid you know I think you kind of base a lot of photographs on your life. And so a lot of it was you know like things that were going on you know in my life or you know you know so even Vogue had that you know like I did one shoot with a Bridget Hall because I always thought Bridget Hall. My daughter had the same coloring. You know stay with the same skin color the same hair color eye color. And my daughter was doing a lot of art so I turned Bridget Hall into an artist for sure.

Because that was at the end of the 90s, right? What? The real story? Yes, the real story. The real story is that Polly Mellon was leaving. She was, you know, retiring and she and Linda Wells approached me and asked, you know, and we met at a like some bar and grill in Lexington Avenue where no one goes. Was Anapist? Well, number one, you're not supposed to do that. And number two, I didn't tell her that's what happened, but I told her I wanted to interview for the job and she, yeah, she got really angry. And she never gets angry. And I got along, always got along really well. You know, she was, because she's very adult, I'm very adult. You know, it's like, this is my job. This is what I have to do. I don't, you know, you don't need a long explanation from me. I mean, you wouldn't know if I'm how much I'm talking today, but and she, you know, so she got angry because we did what we weren't supposed to do. You're not supposed to poach. And so she kept me there for months. And then, and then Tony, Tony Goodman came from Bazaar and took my job. And we shared an office again. We shared one episode. We shared an office, you know, again. And I thought, why am I leaving Vogue Tommy's here? So it's fun again. But then I went to allure and yes, so that's what happened. And, you know, it was great. I, you know, I love Linda. She's a brilliant editor, brilliant human being. And, you know, I think we, you know, we worked really, really well together and we tried to, you know, make the magazine work. Because it was not working so well. It's an incredible run and your covers are so distinctive from, from there. It really, you really did develop a style that I'm sure a lot of other magazines, I mean, do magazines exist anymore as a question? Sadly, they don't. Really? Sadly, they don't. But you and your team there, same thing. Like all the people that worked for you there, I feel like have gone on to do amazing things and also think so highly of you and had such a great time. But what was the big idea? Like what was not working with that magazine that you all wanted to sort of tweak? Because it was, it was a challenging magazine from the start, even though in some ways it was the most brilliant, but it was also the most troubled. The original idea was they were doing it much more like it was a tabloid. So it was like fast information, you know, got it. And it looked tabloid-y, which was kind of great because otherwise it would just look like a pretty magazine that you get at the dentist office, you know, like they have, you know, the doctor's office. And Linda didn't want that. Alex Lieberman, who was the editorial director of Condé Nast, didn't want that. So initially it worked. I think for fashion people, it was challenging because it was not pretty. And then it went right into grunge. And so the editors were doing like, you know, messy hair, you know, not a lot of makeup. There's a magazine that's about hair products, makeup products, and everyone looks kind of like, you know, heroin chic. When I got there, it was just passing. And I said to Linda, you know, it doesn't look like anyone's put a comb through her hair. And maybe we should make it beautiful. And maybe each picture we should change the makeup so you can give makeup credits. Change the lipstick, change the eyeshadow, you know. And so I just, you know, tried to make it make it pretty. And so we did it. You know, that's what we did. And, you know, I said, I don't understand why the covers are so pulled back. Like it's a beauty magazine. Let's do close-ups because I loved the old Vogue covers where it was like, you were right there, you know, and you could see everything. And I said, we should do this this way. And James Truman, who at that time was the editorial director, fought me on it. He didn't like thought, you know, because they wanted the credit for the clothes, you know, the advertising for the clothes. But it's like, if we get close up and you see the makeup, you're going to get that. Yeah. Yeah. Which at the time was probably more lucrative than the clothes. It's still more lucrative in the end, you know what I mean? Yeah. So, yeah, so we did that. And fortunately, Linda just went with it. She was like, you know, she was like, okay, you do it. And then, you know, we would, we had a great run. We were together 16 and a half years. It's amazing. It was so sharp. And she's very sharp. Her writing is very sharp. Her editing is very sharp. But what you did on those covers, it was beautiful, but it was sharp. Well, I think that is the thing is, I think the writing has always been great. The reporting is always very distinct, very sharp, like you said. And I think the visual was not sharp anymore. And I think what happens, we try to make the visual sort of match what they were writing. It was challenging. It was, it's a hard beauty is difficult. Yes. Yeah. It's, it's such a ginormous industry. It's so deeply under covered and Linda's doing a really good job at airmail and there, and we have stuff and there are the trades and everything, but it, and I think that Vogue does good service reporting on beauty with like great writers and things like that. But it is a, it's a hard Rachel Sturgats who writes our beauty column who I'm sure, you know, she, she always talks about this. Even as many crazy characters or, or it's, it's, but I think it's just hasn't been the only person who was poking for so many years was Linda. And it's not the people who they're not as used to, I don't know, it's, it's interesting because it is, it's about the way you look, but clothes are so much more about showing off or, or what have you. It's, it's a, Well, it's bigger. It takes more space. Yes. It's a physical space. Yes. That's true. And I think that, you know, for magazine that works more better because it takes up a lot of space and you know, beauty is very, very polarizing. And right now, especially, you know, because so much of beauty can be alteration, you know, so, you know, like surgical alteration. And so I think that, that has changed a lot of things. I'm sure you know, you seeing this, you live on the West side, right? Of Los Angeles. So it's sort of, I live on the East side. It's a little different, but I have just noticed like everybody here gets something done. And so whereas in New York, it's a little more subtle and then in Europe, it's much more subtle and you become, you think you don't, sometimes like I look in the, in the mirror of my car and I'm like, whoa, maybe I should do something, but because it's just everyone else does. So if you don't have anything done, you look kind of weird. And I was just looking at those Kardashian images from the Mbonnie wedding and thinking about the fact that like the way that they look, and I'm not saying it's bad or good, but it has truly changed the way like perceptions of what is beautiful. And I was just looking at their bodies, but all and their faces and the way they were dressed and all of it all together. And I'd say in the last 10 years, it's, it's so beauty is so subjective, but the, the ideals and beauty norms have truly, truly changed. It wasn't like a blip of heroin chic back to sporty or whatever. It's like augmentation has really augmented the way we think about all this stuff. I mean, completely, I think it's a very, I'm not, I'm a fan of everything. You know, like you want to do it, go for it. You know, I think it's fine. I myself, you know, don't, you know, I've never, you know, I don't want to touch the face, you know, you look great. But I mean, who's looking? I always think that too. You know, 72 years old, no one's looking. I can assure you, but, you know, but my daughter has like this beauty store and part of the whole thing for her was, um, this is, you know, it's going to be a not story. We had never really been separated when she went off to college. She went to Bennington, which is in Vermont. We lived in New York. We had never really been separated for any big period of time. I dropped her off at school. I think the first time I went back was six weeks later. And she looked at me and the first thing she said is, you look really old because she had been so used to. I was 41. No, I have not 41. So she goes, I'm four. I was like 45 or something. She thought I looked really old and I was like, really? And so when she had kids, she realized she thought my face is important to my children. And it's kind of my job to keep the face that they remember. That is a great way to think about it. Because she said your face is important to someone. She said, like, she remembered that the fact that because her mom died, the fact that I was getting old scared her. And I was approaching the age that her mother was when she died because I was in my mid-40s or her mother died when she was 48. So she got like, you know, really, really nervous and realize, you know, that that's what's important is what you're seeing. And so that's why she started her, you know, this beauty thing. And it's to try to like, not stop aging, but to kind of like, slow it down a little bit. And you know, so, but yeah, so I think beauty is important. You know, what we look like is important. Even though we don't want, you know, want to think that we're that thing. I don't want to, you know, be considered that thing, but I'm very vain. That makes me think I really should start saving up for my half-face lift. I'm obsessed with them. I'm obsessed with them. Everyone I know has gotten the lower face lift looks amazing. And but the one that I'm 42, I think I'm going to wait till I'm in my 50s. Everyone's like, you got to do it when you're 47. I haven't even gotten Botox yet. I think I'm going to wait, but, but it maybe I'll start saving. I have to, I have to come to your daughter's store though. What is, what is the name? Knockout Beauty. Okay. And you some, I heard you sometimes will, will be working in there. I work there all the time. I'm going to come in and see you. I came, when I came here, it was the pandemic. She had just opened the store and had to close it. So she took all the product out of the store, put it all on a website. And shipped out of her garage. When I got here, the girl who was helping her with the shipping wanted to go back home because she had had a little, she had a five year old and wanted to go back to where her dad was in somewhere down south. So my first job out of college, I did packing and shipping at an art gallery. You know, I did crafts and I was like, I'll do it. So I did. And so I did that for like a couple of years. And then I was trying to, I was styling a little bit. It was pandemic. So there wasn't any, that much work. And then I just didn't feel it anymore. You know, like the type of work I was getting, you know, in, except for like, I worked for Michael Kors. So that was great. And he's great. And what, you know, and the type of work was great. But I wasn't really, I was getting a lot of editorial, which was costing me money to do because they pay you little and that went to my assistance. And then, you know, all the messengers ended up being, you know, me paying for them. So it really was, and I just thought, I had such a gorgeous career. I had so much fun. Like I had so much fun. I have to tell you, it was, the industry is a great industry. You know, people, you know, shit all over it, you know, and all this stuff happens in it. Yes, true. But basically, it's great. It's fun. The people are actually, yes, there's, you know, Dixon, it is Dixon every industry. I had, you know, all the people that I worked with and for were fabulous. Like, you know, you know, a lot of the people that worked with me and they're adorable. Well, I think a lot, you also hired well and you attracted people who are, I wouldn't say they're like, they're not like softies. They're all tough people and tough, I mean, like thick skin and have a lot of grit. And, but they're all like a lot of them. And I see this sort of lineage with stylists and fashion directors or editors or PR people. Like you could see all the Catherine Ross people are all good people. Every PR person who works in-house, who I'm friends with somehow is connected to Catherine Ross, that kind of thing. But I think like that's the other thing is that it does start with people like you. And with this podcast that you're launching, let's talk about that now. And who are you? You know everyone in the industry. Everybody loves you. Like what kind of people do you plan on having on and why did you want to do this? You're not styling anymore. I think a lot of magazine editors who I've talked to really wish you would still do stuff for them. So what happened was my daughter, in her business, in her stores, she does a thing where she'll do consultations. So you come and you tell her what's wrong and she can tell you what product to use and you get a protocol. And she's very good because she had like melasma from having a baby. So she had things that she was trying to resolve. So she did a lot of research. She's very well informed about all these products. And the store has all these products that are, you know, it's very curated. Someone came to her, she helped the person with their skin. It ended up the person worked at the people that produced the Modern Love podcast for The New York Times. And she said to that and she approached my daughter and said, we want you to do a podcast about skin. So my daughter was like, okay. And then when they looked into her, they realized that both her parents were Vogue editors. She was a Teen Vogue editor. And, you know, it's also the time period, which everyone's so interested in the 1980s and 90s, but mostly the 90s. And they asked her if her dad, she and her dad would do the podcast. I said, no, she said my dad's going to say no, which I did. Because I was, you know, even though I talk a lot, I was sick of talking about myself. So I didn't want to do it. And I didn't want to hear my voice because I hate my voice. So I thought, you'll get used to it. You'll get used to it. No, it's horrifying. But anyway, so she, so, but finally, you know, I said, yes, okay, I'll do it. And it's been really adorable. Very much like when you asked me about, you know, why I left Kibokavako in Duka. There's so much, that was a very big period of loss for me. Yeah. But all the people that we're involved with, like one of the guests is Anna Swee. You know, and Anna Swee is a very close friend of mine. And all throughout that whole sickness, she was the one who helped me move people, you know, the sick people helped me like set up homes, you know, she did all this stuff with me. Took my daughter to get her ears pierced, which I still have not forgiven her for. But so it's a lot of people that we're both very connected to, like Mark Jacobs, Michael Kors. So it's that it's really about our relationship to these people. It's how it started. Of course, like, you know, each podcast goes off into its own world. Like we never know where it's going to go. So that's why we did it. And she was like, she kind of shamed me into it because I won't do a book. And she was like, everybody else has done a book. Oh, I heard, I've also heard this from other people. You got to do a book. I'm bored. No, I'm too lazy. It's too much work. If someone, if I found the right reporter, Oh, it's not that's not that you have to get like the rights to the pictures and yeah. But if I found people to do it for you, would you do it? Like if they just came to you and interviewed you like 40 times. Okay. No, they say. I understand. Like the book in some ways, I have this conversation. I've had this conversation many times with Mickey Drexler. He is also like, I don't want to do this. I just think I don't, to me, a book, even though, I mean, who reads books, it feels like you're a part of culture and history. And you should, there should be a permanent record of that. It is people who are far more like, you want a book on Polly Millen. That's who you want the book on. You know what I mean? That's the person, you know, the original, you want that. I'm, there's enough of people like me. Yeah. That they've done books already. You don't need like one more book, but you know, it's like, you know, I'm already narcissistic enough. Do I have to go fully into narcissism to do it? I just like, and I'm lazy. You know, I have too many other things to do. You know, you have a kid, you know, I'm still driving cars to school. True. And also this podcast sounds awesome when, and it launches this week, right? Yeah. Yeah. It's going to be great. I mean, the thing I would say is no pressure on the book. I understand. I just wrote a book with someone else and I'm still like that. That was one of the most hellish experiences of my life. It's hard, right? It's really hard and it takes way more time than you think and all of that. But what I would just say is that like, I don't think it's narcissism. I think it's more about you. You gave so much to culture and if you want to give one more thing, if you don't feel, if you don't want to do it, you don't want to do it. One thing that I've learned about you in this conversation is that you have really been able to make decisions in your life that felt right for you. And from my perspective, from what you've told me, and that's amazing and really inspiring. I got beat up a lot when I decided not to travel. I mean, I was told by a photographer, he was like, you could have had a bigger career had you travel. I was like, I said, I'm the fashion director of Vogue magazine. How much money you want from me? Like, it worked out. It all worked out. But I always chose for myself or my family. And I think, you know, and you don't have to. I mean, that was just my choice. A lot of people choose, you know, they choose what they choose. I just had to do it that way because I'm so grateful. I was grateful before I had all the loss. I am so grateful. I have a family. Oh man, Paul, we, we didn't even get into your childhood and how you became such an amazing person. You have to come back. Yes. Well, you know that I'm from Fort Apache, the Bronx. That's all you need to know. It's certainly part of it. But I mean, thank you so much for being here. Congrats on the launch. This has been such a pleasure. I just want to give you a big hug. I wish we were in the same room. No, I do too. I have to say, I love your podcast. It keeps me. I love the music. So I know people do. Thank you. I love the music. We're keeping the music, everybody. I think that it's the happiness of it works for me. Thank you. Well, this made me so happy and I can't wait to meet you in person. I'm going to come by the shop the next time I'm on the west side and and. Are you ever on the west side? No. I'm, I actually have to go today, but I'm not, I'm not going to have time. Yes. I come once, once to one to three times a month. Now, we're doing a lot of work. I live in Eagle Rock, which is like really close to Pasadena. Oh, okay. So you're there. Okay. Yeah. And it's when we first moved here, we were going to the west side all the time. And I think because I'm traveling so much for work, the last big trip I did when I got back in March, my kid had a birthday party at Annenberg Beach and I messaged the mom and I was like, it's not happening. I'm never going to the beach on a Saturday. I don't like the beach. I prefer the pool. I don't like the beach. I prefer the pool. So, but I, I do come over. I have, and I like it. It's just, it's, you know, it's basically like living in a different city. Well, it is. It's completely like my granddaughter goes to school in Studio City. Yeah. Oh yeah. So that's far too. I mean, at least that's a little. It's not even that far, but it feels. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, it's like a whole other world. Yeah. Honestly, I think people who live in the Valley have it right because you can get to the west side or the east side or central super easily. But, you know, again, we move from New York, my husband's from Chicago. We weren't going to move to the Valley, even though it's wonderful. Please don't at me. But Paul, thank you again. This was such a pleasure. And it was honestly an honor to chat with you. For me too. Now I'm going to start crying. Congrats. We didn't even say the name of your podcast. Tell them where they can listen to it. Tell them everything. It's under the cover. Under the cover. And you can get it wherever you. Wherever you listen to podcasts. Great. Okay. Cool. Yeah. I'll also link to it in in line sheet and all of that good stuff too. Congrats again. I can't wait to start listening and I can't wait to meet you in person. And thank you for everything. Thank you for doing this. So fun. No, it was awesome. Thank you, Paul. It's a nice meeting. Nice meeting too. Thanks. Take care.
