And today with me on the show is journalist Amelia Petrarcha. We're talking Arno Succession updates. Taylor Swift's watch collection and those Matt Tushin now rumors. Happy Tuesday. Thanks to those who came out last week for Puck's story of the season event in Hollywood. It was so nice to meet many of you. And huge thanks to Colleen Atwood, Janty Yates, Virginia Montell, and Jonathan Anderson who joined me on stage to talk costumes. They were so fabulous. Every single one of them. Costume designers have to be really good at talking. They have to be good communicators as they go and talk to the director and they say, so I want to tell a story through clothes and they have to convince a director whose vision is driving the whole thing that they're right. So they're just, they're great to converse with. And I have to say, I'm sure you all want to hear what Jonathan Anderson had to say. And he was, I mean, he charmed the pants off of everyone, the audience, the other costume designers seemed to love him. And you could really tell he's a great communicator and you could see why he's so successful in his day job and why he's been successful doing these costumes. I mean, he takes everything so seriously and he's so careful and he's also good at communicating what he's trying to do. And it was fun to see him on stage and just a real treat. So extra special thanks to Jonathan for joining us because he's very busy and it was special. So we will run an excerpt from that talk either in fashion people or in line sheet, hopefully sooner than later and just watch out. I know you're all subscribers to both. So you'll definitely get access. This week in line sheet, we have a Cond√© business update. Lots going on there, really interesting. There's also the news of Cedric Sharbet who I had sort of previewed a couple of weeks ago that he may become the CEO of Saint Laurent that has now been announced and is effective January and there's a bunch more. It was so fun to have Amelia Petraca on. If you don't subscribe to her newsletter, Shop Rat, you should. It's not really a shopping newsletter. It's a newsletter about shopping, if that makes sense. It's reporting on the world of shopping. She's a great retail reporter. I'm a huge fan and I have been for years. She has a good sense of story and always picks up interesting things that I would have never thought of. So enjoy our conversation. Amelia Petraca, welcome to Fashion People. Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be here. I'm so excited to have you. How was your weekend? Did you buy anything? It was good. I was up in Hudson, so I feel like I spent a lot of money on like lettuce and like apple cider donuts, you know, farm stand prices upstate. Can we talk about apple cider donuts for a minute? Absolutely. I'm not a fan. I strongly disagree with that. Do you want to know why? Why? Because they're not juicy. Like there's not. You imagine that they're going to be like have some sort of juicy element to them. And they just are like dried out donuts that have a little bit of an essence of spice, which I like. But I feel like you need apple cider to dip in, like to dip them in, to make them palatable for me. Definitely. The one I had upstate that I paid a pretty penny for was like very fluffy in a way that made me realize that I've been eating dry ones from the green like the Project Park Farmers Market. But I have a little, yeah, I like to dip into coffee. I think that that helps. That's a good way. Did you, is that near Alison Roman's store? Did you go to her store? Is that an interior area of upstate? The other side of the river and I don't know how to drive. So I'm at the Wim of my show force. You grew up in New York City in Brooklyn, correct? I grew up in Manhattan. Yeah. Oh, you grew up in, oh, Tribeca. Sorry, I don't want to out you of your entire life. I used to say lower west side because I was ashamed of saying Tribeca, but now I've just come to it for a reason. I grew up in Tribeca. I don't know. It's my parents, I have to do the like coffee out of like my parents moved there before it was Tribeca. But yes, I grew up in Tribeca. No judgment, Amelia. Great. You work hard. That's all that matters. If I'm ever moved back to New York, I'd probably live in Tribeca. It seems extremely. Yeah, it seems easy. They're good public schools, you know. We're never moving back, so it's fine. But I do have my little fantasies of moving to the upper west side or moving to Tribeca. I don't know if I'd ever live in Brooklyn again, to be honest. Yeah, I live in Park Slope now, which I feel like is this sort of uptown-esque neighborhood in Brooklyn. Yeah, I like Park Slope. I lived in Dumbo. Well, I lived in Vinegar Hill, which I loved. And but then just got too crazy with the tourists in Dumbo. And then before that, we lived in Carroll Gardens for a long time. But the last place we lived was Betsy. I was just too far. And I just don't. I don't think I'm made for that anymore. I'm so spoiled by LA. But anyway, what were we talking about that we ended up talking about Tribeca? We were talking about donuts. Oh, yeah. So you don't drive. Have you ever driven? Yes. So I say, I have to say that I don't drive because I do technically have my license, but I got it when I was a senior in high school and I have not gotten behind the wheel since and everyone's like, you can figure it out. But I'm like, absolutely not like it's not something I could just like pick up again. So I did not get my license till I was 38 years old when we moved to. Maybe I yeah, I was 38 when we moved to LA. So and I I did drive a couple of times in high school. I got into an accident. My mom was like, you should probably get it's fine. It was not not a big deal. No one was injured. But my mom was like, oh, you should probably get lessons. And I just never did it. I never got my license. And my husband also didn't have it. And we moved here during the pandemic and we it was just you didn't really want to take Ubers in July 2020. So we find we were just like, OK, I guess we have to learn. And then I got pregnant. Thank God. I mean, I I know people who have children here who don't have licenses, who move from New York and I do I worry for them. Like it's just makes your life so much easier. But thing I would say is I just don't think I was mentally able as a 16 year old. Like I understand now the like seriousness of driving. Whereas then you just can't. I don't know. My brain was not developed enough to to drive. I'm glad I waited. And now I really enjoy it. And I was in like one minor accident, which my my car was in the shop for the last two weeks and it's been very annoying. Yeah. But honestly, like it was OK. And but generally I've been driving for four years and it's I really enjoy it. So what I would say is you should learn, but you would need to take lessons probably. But don't do it until you have to. But going upstate and things, that's like a huge reason we moved because we couldn't do that kind of stuff. Like it was just we were stuck all the time. I felt really stuck. And now I love a train. No, I can take Amtrak so easily or Metro North. Sure. And so I really and now all my friends have cars. So the odds of me learning anytime soon are slim. But yeah, maybe one day later. I think I believe Matt Schneier, our friend and restaurant critic at New York magazine and my neighbor. We used to be like lived next to each other. Amazing. Yeah. He wrote about this for Sunday Styles, I think, or when he was a reporter there. And he said something. I think Matt and I are like the exact same age or you're a part or something. But he said something and maybe this is this will start happening to you. But you may also be out of the wedding craziness. But he had to go to a wedding and rode Island or something. And he was like stuck. And that's happened to me a couple of times. Like we went to a wedding in Portland, like outside of Portland, Maine. You don't want to. I personally don't want to rely on other people to tell me when I'm allowed to leave. Or when I'm not allowed to leave. Like I don't want to have to wait for someone. Once we were, we went to a wedding, my cousin's wedding outside of Pittsburgh. And we had to like get a ride home to the city for my second cousin. And it was like very stressful. We tried to find an Uber and there weren't any because we were in like farm Trump country and there were just no Uber, which is probably seven or eight years ago. It just is one of those things that I feel like it gives you a little control. You don't need to do it until you're in your forties. That's what I'll do. OK, I'll take that. I'll do that. OK, so moving on to the news of the week. I thought it would be fun to chat first off about a mutual friend of ours who shall remain anonymous. Tip me off that Taylor Swift has been wearing this Louis Vuitton Tambor watch in, I believe, 18 karat gold. I'm looking it up right now. Yeah, the 18 karat gold version of the Louis Vuitton Tambor, which has just been recently updated and they're doing a lot of press around. Bradley Cooper, which GQ in this article is referring to as Brad Cooper. Is that a new thing? This must be an accident. Anyway, is the sort of face of it and Jean Arnaud, the baby, his baby of the five are no kids is he's the like head of the LV. LV, the Louis Vuitton Watch Division, which I don't know if it like had a person who was head of it before him. So this watch is like a big thing for LV. And this person messaged me and said, you know, Taylor is never the face of anything. It's interesting that she's wearing this watch. What do you think is up? And I did a little item on Monday and lined sheet about this. But what do you think? Do you think that there's a chance she could be like the next face of the LV watch universe? Do you think that she just like the watch and bought it? Do you think Kelsey bought it for her? What do you think is happening that she's she's sporting this this beautiful? I think like technically men's watch, but who cares? Yeah, I mean, I think I would be surprised if she ever was the face of anything just because she seems just too big to be a face and doesn't just doesn't need that at all. I my hot take that is sort of based on nothing other than being a Taylor Swift fan is that she is a little bit more into watches now that she's been dating Travis. I was like trying to see if she had worn watches in the past. I think she wore that like watch choker necklace to the Grammys. But that was more of a like she's very, you know, she loves an Easter egg. And I think it was like the the choker was set at midnight, which is like a reference to her album. I think this was more of a dislike. I think this is different. This is like she's dressed up and she's at a football game. Like I think it's a good if there was if there was ever a place to wear a like watch that is maybe men's wear like I just feel like this is the place for it. I'm sure that Travis like is interested in watches and has opinions about them. And it's probably got her like watch curious. But also, I mean, she's she doesn't need to be a face. There's so many eyeballs on her at these games. Like I'm sure for any brand that placement is like huge. I mean, she got me to like she's getting me to tune into football games, which is insane. Yeah, I'm still not watching them. But I don't know how my husband keeps up with the stuff because I've never seen a football game on in our house yet. He knows everything that's going on. I actually know like a decent amount about football, which is a secret of mine. But I'm I'm in our fantasy football. Oh, wow. Yes, that sounds fun. Very engaged. Yes. OK, so here's my thing. So she has been wearing this out. She did wear it to that football game in this outfit that's like basically a Chanel knockoff suit that's probably maybe it's Moschino's interpretation or something. I can't tell who they it's like red and red and black check. She did wear it out to dinner and she's just really been wearing it a lot. The one thing I will say about this football game she wore it to, she's making it so you can see the watch in all the poses, which makes me think that it is some sort of thing like some sort of deal, whether they gave it to her or or she had some sort of at the same time. You are exactly right. And I've written about this many times before. So of many other people, there is also probably not a reason for her to do any sort of like marketing campaign for any brand because she is bigger than everyone. And if she was going to do something, she probably just do her own brand. That said, if you think of her kind of a comparison, Beyonce, I would say that Beyonce's more successful marketing things have been when she was the face and not her top shop active wear line that I think ended up being with Adidas, maybe Ivy Ivy Sport, was it called? Or Ivy Park? Yeah. I think that was probably halfway successful, fairly successful. But generally, I don't know if her fashion projects have been as successful as, you know, just being the face of Tiffany, which as much as a lot of people didn't like that, I really didn't like it, especially when it first came out with that image of her and Jay-Z, the Basquiat and Tiffany Blue. I think it's been that was like a pretty successful campaign. And we're looking back on it two years later. I actually do sort of like it. So it's interesting. We'll see. I think regardless, you're right. Travis is an enthusiast. So Taylor is becoming an enthusiast. And you see this with she's just like way more into fashion suddenly. And it's it's the same kind of fashion, but I'd say she's really up the game in terms of her going out outfits, in terms of just like paying more attention. She's wearing a lot of Vivienne Westwood. So yeah, it may just be. I wonder what this garnet ring is that she's wearing also. I mean, I don't know if you saw talking about celebrity like product placement, Charlie XCX was like performing with a Gucci Jackie bag on SNL. Yeah. She does have this like empty bag swinging around, which was so obviously. I actually thought that that was pretty funny because it was like it wasn't trying. Like I think the public is just so much more educated now about when product placement is happening, that it's funny to use it as like a prop rather than like a like a secret sly thing that you're like that you just so happen to be like posing in ways where we can see your watch. So yeah, I don't know. I do think I think the tailor is probably being sent a lot. And I do believe that she's like maybe assembling some of her outfits like based on like a curation from a stylist just because they're so tailor for sure. Yeah, I liked what Charlie did with the Gucci bag. She's a clever one. On the topic of LVMH, the company that owns Louis Vuitton, another Arno air, Bernard Arno is the CEO and chairman of LVMH. He is not the founder of LVMH. And if anyone wants to learn more about LVMH, they should listen to the four hour long acquired episode about LVMH will teach you a lot. It's really, really good. But one of Arno's other children, Alexander Arno, got a big promotion last week. He is now going to be the deputy CEO of Moet Hennessy, which is the M.H. in LVMH, which is their. Giant wine and spirits business. It's it's actually not that giant. It's smallest division now in the business, but it's been there since LVMH was formed in the late eighties. And he's going to be the deputy CEO. The current CFO of LVMH is moving over to be the CEO. He's a numbers guy. The thought is that he's going to sort of teach Alexander some stuff and and be his mentor and be there while Alexander kind of manages. This is a turnaround story. The wine and spirits division has been really struggling the last few years partially because of changing consumption patterns, but also taxes on things like cognac in the U.S. and also in China, people buying less gifts of alcohol, stuff like that. So it's been it's been tough for them. And he is being tasked with sort of rejuvenating this division. This is his third turnaround project. First, he did Ramoa or Ramova, whatever strikes your fancy. Then he was at Tiffany and now he is at the alcohol business, which by the way is owned 30 percent by Diageo, another like giant food and beverage conglomerate. Well, just beverage. I don't think they do. But but so it's an interesting setup. But what do you think about about this? Like, do you follow the are no airs and what they're up to at all? And and have you tracked Alexander in particular? Because he was living in the U.S. and he's a little more on the scene than the rest of the kids, I would say. Yeah, I definitely have been following him. I think I called him like the boy prince or something once. And I'm interested in what he's up to. I think when I started to see his like Trump overlap, I became like very disgusted and didn't want to engage as much. But I wasn't surprised. I know that he like eats at Luke Holly. And like, yeah, he's like trying to do the like, I think he ran the marathon. He's like really trying to do the New York thing. I think this like, I think his move into alcohol is like a really interesting one and will be a big challenge because that it just needs such a refresh. It's so outdated. So I'm interested in it mostly as like a this is a challenge that this kid who's my exactly my age is going to have to face. And I'm curious to see like how he is going to go about it. Can you believe he's 32 years old? I know it's crazy. So crazy. It's so like I love writing about this stuff and he's very ambitious. They're young Frederick, one of the younger kids is super and they're all extremely ambitious. They all want to help run the company. You know, I don't think that I'll be a major be broken up, but they could break it up into five different companies and they would still be some of the biggest companies in Europe. They're giant Louis Vuitton is bigger than caring. It's the second largest rival. The other luxury conglomerate. So at the moment, at least carrying a little bit smaller in terms of annual revenue. So it's just crazy to think that like this kid is this stuff is probably not going to happen for 20 more years, 15 and 10 if Bernard Arnault is very unlucky. So it's interesting. He's 75. So we'll see, we'll see what happens. But yeah, it's crazy to think that he's running a or co-running. Let's be fair. A, I think it's five billion, six billion, seven billion dollar business and also tasked with making it cool, which is really hard. Do you do you drink Amelia? I do. And I think putting a 32 year old, having a 32 year old somewhere in the mix is a good idea. Like they need the sort of next gen perspective, I think in this sector. But I just think, especially with like champagne and I don't know, I'm now that every, you know, I drink Gia a lot now, like the non-alcoholic canned beverage, like I'm just, I think that there has been so many changes and there's a lot of room for improvement. And I think it's, yeah, it's cool to like see what you can do with that. Yeah, I could see in that division, LVMH potentially investing in something like Gia, which is probably the chicest, coolest version of the non-alcoholic drinks. I think it came up actually in, oh yeah, it came up in my podcast with Emily Sumberg because she and I are both friends with Melanie Masser and you probably know as well. She's really great. Uh, I could see LVMH buying that at some point. I don't think with those non-alcoholic drinks, there's a lot of shelf space or there will only be a few winners in that space. Just in the way there's only diet, there's only, I just said diet coke. There's only coke and Pepsi and Dr. Pepper. Like there's not going to be 50 different versions of those drinks that become big businesses, but I could see Gia making it because at A, it tastes good and B, it's, it's well executed. I also think, and this is a big leap, but I wrote about this years ago that once marijuana will be legalized someday, like nationally in the US, once that happens and there is just more regulation, I can see LVMH, they're very conservative, so maybe not, but I could see like that's what a lot of analysts in the food and beverage market thinks going to happen that like a lot of these businesses are going to, these groups will start investing in marijuana, things like that. And that's probably too far for LVMH to go, but as someone who is very senior, they're said to me last week, we're not fun. They're not fun people. Like they're not going to like take a big risk. But if it's a good sound investment and it's legal, then I think there's a chance that you'll see the makeup of those businesses change a bit, which is interesting. Yeah. I know that Bernard is like into wine too. I can see him like, I don't know. I just, I think it's something that he's probably personally curious about. And like, you know, I think can probably help inform the company in terms of like what his demographic is, is interested in and also like spending money on. That's like the next point, but obviously. Yeah. Yes. You ever hit that moment when your kid asks for help with homework and you're like, wait, when did Long Division get this complicated?

So speaking of spending money, it's holiday gift guide season. Oh, is it? It. Yeah. It happened. I was like away in Italy for a while and like got touched back down at the end of October. And my inbox was just like gift guide, gift guide, gift guide. And I was just so not in that mindset. But I know that you have to start earlier and earlier these days. Well, it's interesting because our gift guide is launching this week. It may already be launched when our guide to Merth and Merrimant. It's not all. I guess it is all gifts, but it could also just be stuff you buy yourself. I believe that it is. It should be live when everyone's listening to this. It may not be, you know, this stuff happens when it happens. But we were thinking about timing for it. And I do feel like a lot of guides were published earlier than usual this year. And one of the reasons for that might be that companies, the publishers that rely on affiliate marketing, I think are across the board down this year because people haven't been spending as much money and affiliate marketing became a huge revenue stream during the pandemic when people are sitting at home and buying stuff online constantly. And also there are tons of sub stacks that do a ton of shopping recommendations. Amelia, your sub stack is called Shop Rat, but you don't. It's not just about shopping. It's actually reporting on this sort of culture of shopping. So I know you recommend stuff and you have affiliate links, but that's not a lot of these sub stacks. That's just what it's about. So it's just the market has been flooded with shopping recommendations. And so you have seen everybody sort of getting ahead of this in a way, which is very interesting. I always do a guide. I used to do this when I had a personal newsletter that I wrote when I was when I worked at B of, but I always do like a guide to gift guides, which I'll have in line sheet in the next week or two. But what do you think about this state of the gift guide? Caitlin Phillips, I'm a huge fan of hers. She just launched a sub stack called Gift Guide, which amazingly had not been. She she used she I don't know what she's doing it this year, but for years, she wrote a Google.gift guide that Air Mail would publish at least part of it. She's a great gift recommender. But what do you think about the like sort of flood of recommendations and affiliate driven content? And how how do you see it all shaking out? Yeah, I mean, I think Caitlin was really smart to do that. I I love gift guides to me. They're like a sacred thing. And I loved when New York bag would would put theirs together and they would spend so much time on it and it was really like visual and they would find like I just to me a gift guide is like a is just like a way to discover things and learn about I would always learn about like tons of different stores and like small ones too, which is always really nice. So yeah, I mean, I still think like the magazines do them really well because they're like putting a lot of time and effort into it. But I think because so many of these like bigger publications became kind of like affiliate washed like where there was just like so many Amazon links and stuff like that, that people were really gravitating towards these newsletters that felt more personal and like more tightly curated. And but I think now we're just seeing it's like this sort of silly circle that keeps happening where people leave these institutions, start their own thing and then just like become the thing that they left behind. So I just I think I'm I'm not clicking on most of the sub-stack gift guides because I think that there are probably a lot of them are like really similar. You know, I think with sub-stack you're following your friends or people that you want to be your friend or people you know, tangentially or read. And like those are the gift guides that I'm going to look at is because they, you know, I have similar taste to them or I want to know what like rabbit holes they were going down. But I think for the most part, I'm going to skip the rest of them. I'll still make mine. I'm already like feeling really behind on it. But it's something that I want to spend like a significant amount of time putting together and I just haven't had a chance to do it. And the fact that I'm like late is crazy. Well, you're yeah, it shouldn't be late. I feel like they should really come out the day after Thanksgiving, but it's just gotten it's gotten so wild with the sales, too. That's really the thing is like these Black Friday sales are happening like way before Black Friday. And so, you know, if I have a thing saved on my essence wish list, like it's already gone. And so I think that's why people are starting earlier and earlier is because these products are just already like flying at a discount. And that's what everybody wants is the deal. Yeah, I think something that's underestimated is how much reporting and like you're saying, how much work goes into making these good. It's not. I think from people on the outside of, you know, other areas of journalism or just readers think that like all this information is just stored in people's heads and they can just make recommendations off the top of their head that are really interesting. And the truth is that most people are not that creative or inventive or clever. And it is very, very hard to make a list that doesn't have the things that everybody else has. It's really challenging. And I find it tremendously. I've always just found it extremely hard. Yeah. It's not an easy thing to do. And we started using some affiliate links in Lide Sheet just because we noticed that sometimes when I would write about things, they would sell. And it's interesting because it's this thing of you don't want to recommend something because it has an affiliate link. Right. And I think when it when it's worked for me has been when it's part of the reporting. So I'm writing about Victoria Beckham and her business. And I'm like, by the way, the one of the reasons her beauty business is doing so well is this mascara is really good and that sells like all that context. That's hard to kind of put together. And so this influx, I mean, look, this has always existed. It's just right now we're really feeling it because the world is so instantaneous and the way we process information is so instant. But I'd rather wait for your guide, even if you sent it out two days before Christmas. Then read a bunch of things that are going to have the exact same Lollabay bag or whatever in it. Right. I think we sort of like need to redefine or like reevaluate like why we're even reading these gift guides and opening them like, I don't know. I'm reading them because I get like I said, like I want to learn about stores or brands that I don't know about already. I'm probably buying things like for myself. Like I know what I'm giving my family and friends. I would hope that other people are also like not buying like it. Like sometimes I get inspired. Like I see like a funny ornament or like a thing that I'm like, oh, I am like, I think of someone who might like that. But I think we're, you know, we like gift guides because we like opening 100 tabs on our computer and you know, and feeling this sort of smooth brained like calm of the endless scroll. So yeah, in that way, like it doesn't actually really matter when you publish. But I do think it's like, you know, this is a really good time to make money for people. Yeah. And so we, I do need to like, I would be, it would be smart for me to sort of cash in on this, on this moment. You don't have to answer this if you don't want to, but is affiliate the majority of your like revenue, if you're thinking of your job as a business or is it still only a minority? It's a very small part of it just because I don't really link that much to stuff. And I've been trying to do even less of it. Like I sort of, because it's a slippery slope with affiliates and I don't, I don't like blame anyone for doing it. It's not money that I want to leave on the table, but it like, I do notice that it affects the way that I think about things. And so I really only try to link to stuff that like I've worn myself and that I would like really actually recommend or tried myself. Um, but you know, it's, it's a very small part of what I do, but I, I know that it's like a very large part of what other people are doing. And I don't know, for me, it's like fascinating just to get this sort of like numbers on my side, like I noticed before the election, people were buying like great, like buying, and this was even before like essence had a sale. Like, I don't know. I, I just, you can tell when people are sort of hungry for this stuff. I haven't really done any affiliates since the election. So I don't really know what people are feeling right now, but it's, you can sort of tell when there's a hunger for it. And I wouldn't be surprised if there's that same hunger right now around gift season, but I also would imagine that there's like some fatigue too, where you're just like, my God, I'm going to get everybody like olive oil and call it a day. Yeah. I just bought a bunch of people fat gold olive oil subscriptions, which is a great beautiful. That's perfect. Have you had fat gold? It's so good. And the subscription for a year is like 140 bucks. I don't know. That's a great gift. It's such a nice gift and they send a little magazine. It's very cute. Uh, yeah, it's a good gift. Sorry, I was just going to say like the best gift guides are the ones that like with Caitlin, like I don't actually think I'm going to get anything from her. Like they're fun because like a lot of the stuff is like stuff that you literally cannot get. It's like a rare book and there's one of them, but like that's why, like you said, like, wow, wow. I get so that in Molly. That was exciting. Um, wow. Okay. We're all okay over here. I just talked with my hands and like flipped my laptop off. That was, that was a love the drama. Love the drama. Anyway, yeah, and I could come out the day of Christmas and I would sorry. Yeah, I would say that Caitlin recommended this and patch a book called Truth and Beauty, and I do recommend that to everyone, especially if you love and patch it and you also love like New York in the nineties and you also love tragedies and it's just really good. I love this book so much and I highly recommend it. I believe that Maddie Khan recommended it to me and she's a huge, uh, she's one of few people who recommends books to me that I read and then I really enjoy them. So I highly recommend that and Caitlin obviously agrees. So I wanted to, Amelia, I can't wait for your just to end that one. And that segment, I can't wait for your gift guide. It's going to be great. Uh, I recommend on MUN in Monday's line, she eats some pink lipstick because I really want to bring back wearing lipstick and not lip gloss. I think it's a epidemic that a lot of people are dealing with right now. Like people will still wear red lipstick, but they won't wear pink lipstick. I wear it all the time. Have you noticed this? Like no one wears lipstick anymore. Unless it's red lipstick, they just wear lipstick. Well, do you mostly wear red? Yeah, yeah. That was just because my coloring though, like I think pink would look nice on you. It looks good on me because I have no color on my lips, but I've just noticed I'm being like pressure to wear lip gloss and I think I'm too old. I think at some point you shouldn't wear lip gloss anymore. And I feel like all the, all the lip oils I'm buying and things are like sort of glossy, but not crazy. But it's an interesting moment in time where lipstick is really not if unless you're wearing red is not really part of the conversation or nude or while nude is the wrong word, beige or whatever. Maybe it's because they weren't like the stick. I feel like there was a lot of like stains happening. Like people were really just wanting her lips to be like tattooed. Yeah. And the issue with a lot of these lip oils and lip stains and things is that the color is very uneven. So you have to work really hard to get the color even anyway. I'm a big cone of lipstick, especially airmenes and all the pinks are really good. Yeah. This show is brought to you by Boca.

Moving on to the rumor of the week, Emilia. Once again, there is another name in the mix for the creative director of Chanel. Matt Tu Blasey, who is currently the creative director of Bottega Veneta. I heard this about two weeks ago from someone who worked at Caring that Matt Tu was interviewing now, WWD and Astrid Wenland are both reporting this. Look, I'm sure he interviewed. Like, I'm also assumed that if it wasn't the same person who told all three of us, they have spoke. The person who told me probably has spoken to the person who told them or people who told them. This is coming from in Caring for sure. He probably has done an interview. Is he the next creative director of Chanel? I don't know. And if this leaks before Chanel wants it to, Chanel has not done its job. That's what I will say. I will be looking into it as I'm sure many other reporters will. But I would say that like their job is for this news not to leak, especially given the way Virginia Byard's news got out. So my question for you is, what do you think of the idea of Matt Tu being the creative director? He has done an incredible. He used to be the creative director of Maison Margiela. He worked for a long time with Ralph Simmons and Peter Mueller. What do you think of him being and he's done an incredible job at Bottega? We love the runway. We love the way he's updated the handbags. We love the craft, his use of materials and texture, his ideas. He's really thoughtful. He seems very kind. He's easy to deal with and communicate with. They have a cool mix of celebrities at Bottega now. It just feels really good. There's a great, he has a great energy. What do you think of the idea of him taking over the most, you know, important couture house in the world? Yeah. Um, I mean, I'll preface all of this by saying like, I agree with you. I think he's so talented. I really like what he's done at Bottega, mostly as just like objects. Like I have no interest or ability to purchase any of it. Um, it's not something that like I really think about in that way, but just like looking at it, I'm like, oh, this is, you know, this is pleasing to my eyes. And I think it's like really just nice to see a designer think so much about craft and be creative. Um, when I saw that said, like when I saw the news, I was like kind of bummed because I don't, he's not my first choice for that job. I think he has all the right like credentials, like you said, uh, Raph, I think he worked, he had like a Phoebe overlap at one point, you know, like he, he has the chops and like the resume, but, um, I want some, I want, and it's, this is like entirely subjective, but I just, I want Chanel to have like bite in the way that I think Carl, like it was fun and like kind of, I don't know. I, my, my pick is, is, uh, Eddie. And I think he would make it like, I don't know if you can, this is like, I'm allowed to say this on a podcast, but I think he would make Chanel like really cunty in a way that like I would really enjoy. Um, let's normalize that word. I agree. I'm just, I think like I don't buy Chanel. Like I've, it's never been a brand that I've ever aspired to buy, but I think if Eddie was in charge, like I would, I would, he's so good at like bourgeoisie, like rich bitch. And that's what I think Chanel is, um, or stands for, or could stand for. And I can understand if they like maybe want to go in a different direction, but I'm like, why would they do that? Um, he's my pick. And I think Matthew, he's like, he's a little nice. I don't know. I don't really watch Chanel. I agree. And look, he's quite young. I think he's 40. He might be 38. He may have it and we just haven't seen it yet, but I agree. I mean, Eddie is my pick. Mark Jacobs is another one. Eddie, from what I've heard is out. Like he does, he has expressed that he does not want it at this point to people. I, he's very close with Virginia, the way Virginia exited the business. And also I do think they have been trying to sort of reorganize the business to kind of work more in tandem and also at the same time, there's a lot of talk of in the way Hermes has someone who runs the jewelry, someone who does Pierre Hardy does jewelry and choose Nadezh does women's wear. You know, they have different people running each Maison. There has been a lot of talk with Inch and now that they might manage it that way. If Mat 2 is just doing couture and kind of overseeing ready to wear, then maybe it could work. That said, I think the biggest, now look, what I wrote on Monday on Line Sheet is like, this is starting to become like, you know, that term good on paper. Like when you're looking for a husband and they check off all the boxes. This is what's happening that like there are boxes to be checked off. And Eddie Salman checks them all off, but he'll want too much control. Mark Jacobs checks them all off, but he is sort of the question is like, would he be able to do his own line and this at this point in his life? Would he want to do that? All of that. He also told me, I interviewed him for a piece and I don't know, to take this with a grain of salt, but he told me that he was that was not the job that he was like it wasn't but it hadn't been offered to him and he had, you know, was not expecting to get it. Yeah, which is a bummer. Yes. And there are other people like Daniel Rosebury. I heard he was interviewing a long time ago, but then I heard he never got a call. The same kind of chat about Tom Brown that like he was interviewing and they never got a call. Who knows? They've probably all, Jack Amuse, I definitely did interview, but he just started raising money for his own brand, which makes me think it's not happening because what I've been told is that this job is you cannot do anything outside. So like every person who is sort of in the Ronnie Peter Mueller is exciting and would be great and may have that bite that you're looking for, but he's been so good at a little liar, it would make me sad. Like everybody there's like, they check off a lot of the boxes and not one. The thing about Mat2 that I think could be the hardest part is from what I've heard from people connected and inside Chanel is that one of the issues with Virginia was that she does, she was a number two. She didn't want all that attention. And a big thing, Chanel is a marketing engine and Carl was like out there. They have all these ambassadors. Carl was out there like taking his photo with all of them. That doesn't seem like Mat2's vibe. Like there are tons of botega celebrities, Jacob Elordi, Julianne Moore, but that is like those people are just chill people. And you can see Mat2 like hanging. Julianne Moore like hangs out with designers. She's really good friends with Tom Ford. Like she's just a chill lady. Like there isn't going to be, I can't imagine Mat2 in a line with like all the Chanel ambassadors. It just seems, and maybe he has it. Maybe he does. And maybe they don't care. Like that's the thing. We just, we don't know. But yeah, he's not my number one pick. I adore him. I like him at Botega in the same way that I like Peter at Alaya. And also if any of these people get it, we're all going to be like fine. There are people who if they get it, I'm going to be like super bummed and disappointed. Let's hope those people don't get it. I know. Yeah. It's like I really had to like, like I want to be surprised. Obviously, like I would love it to be a pick that's like, oh, wow, that could be like really fun. But like it's like it's too big of a machine for them to like, why would they, you know, take a risk on someone interesting. But yeah, I don't know. I think Eddie's like kind of the only person that would make me like buy it. I think. Yeah. Just because I love, I loved what he did at Celine. Like I was wanting to buy that. And Alaya is kind of the only other brand that I'm feeling that way now about where I like really wish that I had all the. I agree. In the world. He's really good. He's really, really good. He could do it. So let's see. And he also is chiller about like you could see him lining up with 40 women and getting a photo and feeling good about it. He's like, it's funny because they were in a relationship for a very long time. So it's funny that they're the two that people have talked about. But honestly, I don't know. And if I do know, I'll let everybody know. But they should be keeping this tight. Like the way that the Virginie News came out was not good for them. And so hopefully they are being careful. Amelia, this was so fun. Thank you for being here. Yeah, thank you so much for having me. I love doing this. And we'll talk soon. Yeah, thank you. Talk to you soon.
