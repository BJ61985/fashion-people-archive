Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Puck's Fashion and Beauty Memo Line Sheet. And today with me on the show is writer, publicist and general opinion holder, Bonnie Morrison. We're talking Met Gala Red Carpet, the costume institute's latest exhibition, plus news about the fate of LA based merch label, online ceramics, and the future of designer, Ricardo Tichino. Happy Tuesday everyone. I am still in New York. I'm heading home tomorrow. It's been a very productive week. I did go to parties this weekend. Had a great time at Versace. Saw a bunch of people. It felt like quote unquote everyone was there, just like a fun cocktail. The Grace Wales Bonner thing up at the Guggenheim on Saturday night was truly incredible. It was a ticketed event and there were performances, but not only could you walk through the Rashid Johnson exhibit, which is like, I implore you to go. It's so wonderful, but also it was the best dress crowd I've seen and I don't know, maybe ever. It was really only in New York moment. I also had a very good time at Moncler, albeit briefly, but it was just people, the celebrities just really show up to Moncler. Colin Kaepernick was just hanging out, that type of thing. That was very fun. It was at the Casa Cipriani downtown, but I have to say, I got a lot of work done this week. Meeting people. I had tons of meetings, coffees, breakfast, all that stuff. Therefore, line sheet is just chock full of news, scoops, analysis. You must subscribe to me, Sarah Shapiro, Rachel Shriatz. We're coming to your inbox five days a week. Also, my big takeaway this week is that everyone in New York is so young, especially downtown. I don't know. I guess I got old, but I also realized that if you want to live in New York and you want to live downtown, you kind of have to be single and not have children. I don't know. I also wasn't hanging out in Tribeca and the financial district when I was in my 20s. I know my POV is skewed, but it is one hell of a town. There's nowhere else like it, and I'm glad I get to come here a lot. I'll see you again soon. Bonnie Morrison, welcome to Fashion People. Hello, Lauren. This is so exciting. I'm so pleased to be with you tonight. This is a long time coming. It should have happened way before, but you wrote an amazing piece that made me think, stop the presses. I got to have Bonnie on this episode because you always speak the truth. I just thought you had a lot of really interesting things to say in your newsletter today, which is called Is It Okay? Everyone should subscribe. Is it okay? Bonnie is the modern mismaners. Is it okay if I act a certain way? Is it okay not to like this? Is it okay not to like something? You're always answering the existential questions of modern society and how to go through life. Thank you for being here. Yeah, I try to make them timely, which is not hard. I think there's always something. There always seems to be something in the discourse that people are trying to reconcile, especially, and I think that that's been the case ever since I launched, which I think I launched it in 2023. Because I think in starting in 2021, when we're all cooped up in the house, but we're dealing with all this like major social upheaval, I would often get people who would want to, particularly around social media, and I'm always surprised about how much it, even the sort of existential questions, as you say, really have to do with our internet behavior. So many of the things that I think we feel create these ethical dilemmas or this strife between friends and family members and how we show up in the world always hinge on something that wouldn't have been an issue before we had the internet in our lives. And so I think people would reach out and they would say, oh, I want to post this, but I don't want it to be performative. I want to post this and I don't want to get canceled. And by the way, these were just friends, people like my sister. It's not like my sister has a million Instagram, but I think she would be only people with all her people in her family. But I think it was something that people rightly were very sensitive about. So I would just sort of give my two cents and then that evolved into this newsletter, which has been very illuminating and people have been really nice and you're nice to pay me a compliment. So I'm grateful for that. I'm a big fan of yours all around your newsletter and you're just like you as a human being. So I appreciate you being here. So before we get started on all things Met Gala, I'm just kidding. It's so funny. I'm getting like, did Kim Kardashian come in yet? I guess she must have. I haven't seen it. Because I've been watching the coverage for the last three hours and it really is. I mean, I suppose it's just people have to be grateful and just figure that it's just nice to be invited. But it is and I obviously knew this. When I worked at KCD, KCD had not yet started or had not been giving the full Met Gala support that they do. Obviously, when I worked there, I worked at KCD from 2026 to 2028. 2006 to 2008. You know, so funny. My first memory of you is, is it possible is the Brian Reyes show and KCD is the PR firm that many of the people listening will know about, but it's like a big powerhouse PR firm that does a lot of events. And I remember seeing you at his show, probably racing down around my wearing a headset, but which I did for many years. But I, so I, what was I saying? When we, but I obviously knew and you know, you knew that, I mean, they got it down to a science, the way that they stagger arrivals, but it has been very interesting to see, you know, sort of the ascending, you know, from sort of a, you know, sort of, I don't want to call anyone, you know, C or D list, but people that I and I am not at all as plugged into pop culture as I once was, but to see people whom I literally have never heard of before to then steadily, it's like, okay, they've got some big wattage and they were got some big wattage. And this person's here and this person's here as solo and this person's, and this person is clearly, you know, walking alongside this other person and that person must be the person who dressed them. And so to really watch this, you know, this, this, they're ramping up from about, you know, so when I started watching at six o'clock. And then of course, you know, the people that I follow who are, you know, all of their prep to really getting to, to wondering if there were certain people who are going to appear or not appear. So that, that has been a lot of anticipation built up. Well, I am really looking forward to talking about it with you all. And I just want to say with you, Bonnie, and everyone who's listening, you're here with us in spirit. The one thing I will say, and then we really should talk about these other two things really quickly, but I just want to say to everybody who does red carpet coverage, you all really need to get faster with your, your outfit credits. Like I am on, I'm not even going to say, first of all, Vogue, in and of itself, most of them don't have outfit credits next to the name of what someone's wearing of stuff that I already know specifically, like Miley Cyrus is wearing a Liya. Everyone knows that none of these outlets have it on there. People want to know what it is. A lot of people know a lot of fishermen who works at Page Six Style and Hillary Kerr, who is the chief content officer of a bunch of different brands, including who, what, where are excellent at this. And I suggest you all follow them during the red carpet evening. But I think like if you are doing red carpet coverage and you're doing best dressed, you need to have the outfit credits that needs to be your main job for the evening. And I'm very frustrated this year. Totally agree with you because knowing what people, I mean, this is, it's not, this is not, you know, the sort of pre-UMA in wearing Prada at the Oscars moment. Like we've been doing this for a long time. So my understanding is that people as a PR, you would scramble to blast out to every single person what people weren't wearing. But the point being like, I need to know who these people are wearing. Just do your, this is your job. Okay. So really quickly before we get to Matt Gallow, there are two things I want to talk to you, talk to you about. One was, are you familiar with the company online ceramics? Only because I saw this, was it you or was it Max Stein who posted, who posted about this? I saw it. It might have been Max Stein, but it was also me. I did a piece about this. Oh, yes, I posted about over the weekend because I was like hoping someone would explain to me what happened. And I, luckily, there was a lawsuit, well, not a lawsuit, but there was a bankruptcy filing. So I was able to see what the accusations were from the two parties involved. And then after I published my story with all the information, someone followed up close to the situation and was like, that is all exactly what happened. I don't know. I'm only getting one side of the story. But basically, so this brand, and it's not, the way I described it is meaningful merch. So it was like these two young kids in 2016. And if you want to know more about online ceramics, those of you who do, I hope you're not offended by my lack of knowledge. Everyone know me, Fry wrote about them, I think, in 2018. And she did a very good job at like explaining what, like their place in the culture and why people are interested in them. But in the era of merch becoming like post Kanye and post Bieber, Jesus merch, that kind of stuff, this brand sort of came out of Los Angeles, the east side of Los Angeles. And it was very elevated merch that was for dead and co, or the dead or whatever it's called in this iteration. And they like developed a really big following in the menswear scene. Like if you, if you read Blackbird spy plane, you used to wear online ceramics, I would assume you don't anymore because you've moved on. But it was these two young guys and they were like very earnest. And it became this really big thing. And then in the middle of last year, Sam Hynett, GQ wrote this very romantic piece about them breaking up and not romance, they weren't a romantic couple, but like the piece was romantic about how important online ceramics is merch company. They're very like a 24 coded. Like I don't know if Kaylin Phillips was ever their publicist, but probably like it's that kind of thing. And he wrote this thing and they did a book and it was like, they broke up. So the last week I got someone messaged me, I think on Saturday. And they were like, for a long time reader, first time caller or whatever, I, it was very cute, but they were like, did you see that there was a bankruptcy filing of in February, online ceramics filed for chapter seven bankruptcy, which is liquidation. And this person was like, you should also, and said, I tried to get merch from them. And for the last dead, dead sphere show, which, you know, I definitely did not attend. I don't know about you, but those people were at the sphere for a long time. And they were a lot, I think, don't me fry once again wrote about it. And they never sent the merch, but the, the store is still operating. So I look into it, I send it to Eric Gardner, who is our legal correspondent. And he's like, I said, I'm confused because they filed for chapter seven, they never liquidated the websites up and running still. And then they filed again. And then that was dismissed. So Eric analyzes this document. He's like, actually, it looks like the two co-founders are in a big fight. But turns out that Elijah Funk, the one of the co-founders is accusing Alex Ross, Alex with an eye, saying that he used them like, like he paid himself essentially. And again, this is all legend. I don't know the actual information. It's, it's just in the, I'm just reading from this document. I don't have any other information other than what the document says. And it's saying that instead of paying their vendors, including Dove Charney, Los Angeles Apparel, because they use those blanks. And instead of like all these other companies, they, and paying their employees, they allegedly took the money himself. So something happened between that time and March 11th or whatever that they were able to, or March 15th, they haven't had to go out of business. And then they filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. And so they, they filed a motion to move it from chapter seven to chapter 11. The motion was was denied. Nothing has happened. But in the meantime, and no one knew the website's still up and running. I think there were people who were having issues getting product. It must have put someone down a rabbit hole. And they found this filing, this bankruptcy filing. So all, they went full spotlight. Yes. So all weekend on accent on boy Reddit, as one of my editors was what's boy Reddit? I was like, it's a joke, but it's just like, you know, like they're in the how long gone sub Reddit talking about it. And they're like, blah, blah, blah. And they're saying all this stuff. But it's just, it's fascinating to me because as you know, and so I did a little item on this, I reached out to both of these guys and reached out to one of their lawyers. All the people I could find, no one responded to me. I gave them, I think I gave them at least 24 hours, if not 48. I gave them a good amount of time. No one responded to my queries. My question for you is like, the interesting thing to me about this is everybody's talking about this brand being over, and merch being dead. And I don't see it that way at all. This is just like, how often does this happen in fashion? This happens like every other week in fashion, right? Like two co-founders get mad at each other and have this crazy thing happen behind the scenes. And we just usually don't find out about it. Well, it's, yes, we usually don't find out about it. Although, you know, I mean, it's so if you really, if you in a fit of peak decide that you want to burn someone, it is not that difficult because you, all you need to do is sort of get it. It's not even getting into the right hands. It's just circulating it to enough hands that it becomes that something, you know, your personal problems can quote unquote go viral. I think it's, you know, and something that, that, you know, we were taught in my generation, Generation X, not that we always abided by this, but, you know, like maybe I think that, you know, by and large, I feel like people my age are quite averse to having any of your disputes appear in the press. That's what you want to avoid at all costs. And people, I think that, you know, there's a, there's a younger generation that doesn't feel that way. But I also think, I mean, and not to, not to, to keep harping on the age thing, but I also, you know, the, you know, as everyone's been talking about this sort of Gen X apocalypse, we did, or, you know, work apocalypse, we did work for other people. So, you know, working with difficult people and figuring out how to work towards de-escalation. I mean, look, embezzlement is embezzlement. Alleged embezzlement is embezzlement. And, you know, dipping into the company coffers to buy whatever is, you know, that, that's, that has always existed and it will continue to exist. But I think, you know, a lot of the stuff that I see as, you know, this idea, and, and I've heard, you know, many younger people say, oh, well, you know, I want to be my own boss and I'm really entrepreneurial and, you know, I have a lot of ideas and I want to be a founder and I want to be a creative director and I want to be, I think, you know, a lot of this, there's a lot of stuff that you learn from working with other people, working for other people that, that helps you be better at sort of picking the people that you do want to go into business with and maintaining better boundaries. And also understanding that, you know, I would think it's great to have a business that's successful where all of a sudden you feel like you're minting money, but money is what? The root of all evil because it causes so many problems between people, you know? So I think that has, that has to have something to do with it, right? It's experience. For sure. You're so wise, Bonnie. And best of luck to Elijah and Alex. I hope they work it out. I, they seem like sweet boys. I just, I feel bad for them. So the other really quick thing I wanted to mention to you was, and, and before we, we started recording, I brought this up and you did not know, which is the, the key, you had not heard about this, which is the key to me, which is that, so last week on April 29th, this person named Patrick Cooper accused in New York filed a lawsuit against, against Ricardo T. Shee, accusing the former Givenchy and Barbieri designer of drugging and sexually assaulting him. I did not hear the piece. There was a piece on April 30th that ran in the independent, a British newspaper that does a lot of reporting. I think it's probably like a mid-market newspaper. If you're gonna, if you're gonna say that you, yes, you agree good. So then I didn't hear anything about it. I didn't get any texts. Ricardo T. Shee has been someone that has come up in a lot of conversations I've had recently, because he wiped his social media about right after the day before Demna was announced to Gucci. And so people were like, is he going to Balenciaga? They have a big menswear business. He would be good at it, blah, blah, blah. He came, he's been coming up a lot also because at one point he was in the running for Versace years ago and it didn't end up happening. And he's always in the mix. Like he's hugely talented designer. He's a very good couture designer, great menswear designer. And so he is someone who's been like top of mind to me. No one messaged me. No one said anything. The story runs in the New York Times on Friday or Saturday and somehow it surfaces in my Instagram. I don't get an alert. I don't get any information. I have all these Google alerts. Nothing comes up. I go to parties on Saturday, forget to mention. I knew I would write about it on Monday and my idea was sort of looking at like, what are his business prospects now that this happened, regardless of the outcome, regardless. And I should say that Tishi's a representative for Tishi sent me a statement saying that he roundly denies these claims and he will fight to prove his innocence, that type of thing. And so he is saying this is completely not true. But even if he says that like, when it comes to sexual assault accusations and it also, all this stuff, like I already started to formulate what I would write about for Monday and started thinking about it in the context of this Nike collaboration that he's been doing and he has set to have more come out. And then I was out on, I went to a party on Sunday night and I asked one, I remembered to ask one person and this person was like, oh yeah, I saw that. Guess he's not doing the Nike collaboration. And just like didn't care. Like it's not that whatever, like it's not no judgment on anyone. To me, the interesting thing was that like, it's just we've been through this so much that no one, nothing surprises anyone and also the sort of seriousness of the accusations and the allegations and what could happen to his life even if he didn't do anything. Like is kind of crazy that it's just like none of us as a society seem to care about this stuff anymore. These are the things that I think we've all spent a lot of time thinking about, especially in, fashion used to be so different where there used to be so even fashion where I think a lot more freewheeling in terms of sex, drugs and rock and roll. And I think that like we were talking about, I think since 2020, I think fashion has really felt the need to really respond to these things. But I think they are hard to keep up with. I think even without a sort of a personal investment in someone's talent, like you say, or even knowing people personally, I think that rushed to judgment. I think if anything, I think sort of as people trying to metabolize this information, I think we all just kind of wait and see. And I think making no judgment about Ricardo's situation, but just because everybody, it puts us in this strange place, right? And everyone sort of thinks, well, maybe if we, because we've seen what happens when people jump in and defend someone, that's not the person that I know. A person that I know would never do that or this person defending people's character, that blows up in your face. And factually, we don't, just because someone is a good friend to us. And this is something that we really know about fashion, just because someone is a good friend to you or a good friend to your face doesn't mean that they can be counted, that they can be relied upon to be a good person everywhere. And that's human nature, I think. But I think we have definitely, right, I think we've moved to this place of everyone just kind of, it's different for people who have a contractual relationship with someone. But I think for everyone else, it's just sort of like, well, let's just see how it plays out. Because I think that constant reaction, I think we got into that cycle of reacting and canceling people and the notes, apologies, and then that's not good enough. And then I'm doing the work and I mean, it's exhausting. It's really exhausting. I don't think we have good mechanisms for understanding how to deal with all this. But I think, and then on the other hand, I think that there are certainly situations where there were, there are people with patterns of behavior, not usually the sexual assault, but I think that when we look at people who in fashion who were sort of emotionally abusive. But I think, and I think that there tends to be more of a reaction there where it's like, oh, well, that person had it coming because we knew that they abused, they abused their, the expense policy or they abused their assistance or they abused their, but I think, when it comes to private things and personal things and things that are not necessarily happening during work hours, that doesn't validate them, it doesn't excuse them. But things that are happening that where the rest of us cannot really evaluate or know what is really happening, I think people are learning to, that the best course is just to stay out of it and let the people who are investigating those things determine, you know, determine what the truth is. Yeah. Have you seen John Proctor as the villain? No. To play that's on Broadway right now, it's really good. And it's, it takes place in high school in Georgia in 2018 in the middle of Me Too. And it's just an interesting, it's, it's related to this in some ways. And I, I recommend everyone go see it. I saw it this weekend. The other play I went to see this weekend, I cannot recommend to anyone. Oh my goodness. It is another one I don't want to be mean. It was, it was, it was tough for me. My, I'm not really a theatrical person and it was too theatrical. I never go see music. Nothing works. There's nothing more uncomfortable than a bad play, especially if someone you know is in it. Never go to a friend's play. I don't, I don't, thankfully, well I actually do, I am friends with some actors, not with LA, but I don't think any of them are going to be in place. I, I did go see, I mean, Tavi Gevinson is not my friend, but I know her. I did go see her and this is our youth and that was awesome. Well, that I think is different because it's like that there was a reason to go and there was Kenny Lonergan, right? Yes. Yeah. That exact. This is like, these are, I, I can go see a Kenny Lonergan play every single night. I cannot, what I saw on Sunday and let me just say, I'm not going to say what it was because I just feel bad. This person like is the only, my hints are, is the only person in the play and plays like seven different characters and it is looked exhausting and I, they deserve some sort of reward and they also were at the Met Gala. So it is a crushing experience. I like a bad movie. I even like a bad novel sometimes. A bad play is as bad as it gets. It is as bad as it gets. You just, I mean, you just want to disappear into a whole novel. I agree. Okay. My heart is with you. So Bonnie, thank you for, for shedding light on these two very serious topics. Again, everyone from the, the first thing, online ceramics did not respond to requests for comments and Ricardo T. She denies any wrongdoing across the board.

Listen to and follow Aspire With Emma Greed, an Odyssey podcast available now wherever you get your podcasts. Now, Met Gala, let's talk about your piece today because I went to the preview this morning and I was sort of taken aback. Can you talk a little bit about what this year's theme is and also your relationship to the Met Gala because you've had a very long, rich career in the fashion industry, including you're an editor at Vogue, Men's Vogue in particular. Shout out to, who was the editor? Was Jay Field in the editor? Jay Field was the editor. If Men's Vogue were still around, I'm sure that we'd be danting it up all along for that. We would indeed. And you've worked on different comms projects for years. You've worked at big brands like Coach, but you worked at KCDMPR Consulting and you know everybody and everybody knows you. And I always say when I was 20 years old, I had lunch breakfast with you at the Mercer and you were like, don't wake up when you're 35 and only have friends who work in fashion. And I listened to you. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. And although, you know, now, well, now you rule fashion. No, it's true. I think it's, no, fashion has been good to me, but fashion, I think, well, and I think it's sort of a good segue, right? I mean, I think, and I really want to be, I want to be respectful of, it was, so let me back up. You know, seeing, so the theme of the Met Ball is, it's called Super Fine, I think, and it's, you know, sort of fashioning the black dandy and the idea of the black dandy and dandy asm. And, you know, this, this, which is kind of a refraction of sort of Western and, you know, and in some ways, you sort of, I guess, colonial and kind of anti-bellum identified dress and and sort of sartorial modes of sartorial dressing as interpreted by, I think it calls it the Atlantic, but by the interpreted by the African sort of Atlantic diaspora. And so, you know, I think, you know, we think of Dapper Dan and a lot of these, you know, sort of the reemergence of that has been, especially as we've seen, you know, the proliferation of, you know, either figures from music, a lot of figures from sports, and, you know, that idea of the, what is it, the, not the stadium, what is it, the tunnel, the tunnel dressing and this idea of the black, the black man as, you know, extremely stylish and really loving clothes and really, you know, creating swagger, you know, having, having this swagger and this, you know, this really Dapper and really refined look and sort of what that means. And even though it, you know, has origins in tailoring and this Western tailoring, but has a totally different, has a different relevance. Talking about is, I think, their words, not mine, sort of as an active, an active resistance, you know, a way of expressing sexuality, not just sort of heterosexual, sort of that black, that very contested black male sexuality, but also a, you know, a more fluid sexuality and, and sort of a gay and sort of gay identity. So I have not seen the show, you've seen the show, but I think, you know, to your point, I know I've talked a lot here, but to your point of not having friends in fashion, what I saw in, you know, thinking about this, and as I was writing the piece over the weekend and thinking about this, I, all of a sudden, people have equated dandyism and the black dandy and the avatar of the black dandy with Andre Leontali. And so that was really interesting because that was, nothing I saw was that made explicit. And I think that Andre is such an interesting character, both as, you know, as representative or the culmination of this, you know, this, this, this, this legacy of, of, of the black dandy and this, this history of the black dandy, but also, you know, a very sad tale in many ways and talking about, you know, the, the idea of, you know, for, you know, for, for black men, sort of deprived of franchise, deprived of education, deprived of, you know, sort of social and professional mobility. It then becomes about the suit and the fur and, you know, we see in the 70s and we see, you know, this, this sort of like, you know, I hope this doesn't insult anybody, but sort of, sort of the pimp style and the pimp, you know, that was, that was really exaggerated and these, you know, these kind of black exploitation films. But, you know, there's a lot of style there and a lot of incredible costuming and incredible, incredible references, I mean, set aside the exploitation of women, but, and, and sex workers, but, you know, that is, you know, the huge collars and the big hats and the walking sticks and that which you've seen a little bit of referenced in a less exaggerated way on the carpet tonight. But I think, you know, I, the basis of that is, you know, you know, people who, you know, in sort of ghetto fabulousness and people who, you know, don't, you know, who, who may live in housing projects or who may live in, you know, it may live in ghettos, a word that we probably don't use that much anymore. Though, though, you know, it's apt, it just means kind of, you know, it means sort of a neighborhood where everyone's alike. They're not just, they're not all black ghettos are not the only ghettos that exist. But, you know, this idea that, you know, to put all of your, to put all of your resources, because, you know, you, because you, you can't own a home, you can't get a loan, you can't, you know, you, you aren't, you're not living within, you're not able to access the American dream in the same way, and to put everything into how you present yourself and to, and, and, and, and for that to be a source of pride. But at the same time, for that to be, there's something very empty about it. And as we know, I mean, I don't want to speak at all in a disrespectful, I knew Andre, was not close to Andre, but I know many, many, many who are, and who really feel that they, you know, they credit, you know, his investment and his belief in them in really, you know, helping them, helping them build their careers. People, people who, whom I admire very much and who are friends of mine, people like Zach Bosin, people, my friend Teddy Tinson, who had, you know, incredibly close relationships with him. But, but I think at the end of the day is how I sat in my piece, I think for anyone who, you know, who didn't come to fashion, you know, you know, sitting on, you know, an enormous fortune. I mean, there's obviously that image of, you know, everyone who works at Kanyanast and, you know, all, you know, all the bow girls, you know, daddy sent me to Bogue, you know, who are either, who either come from fortunes or expecting to marry them or both, you know, the idea to, to die, or to come to the end of your life and have nothing to show for this life of opulence and luxury. And so I think, you know, that made the idea of the dandy, you know, what the dandy, sort of the, you know, there's this, there's something incredibly celebratory about the dandy, but I think with, with Andre as the avatar, it just made me think about there was also something, you know, what, because I've asked this question in my own life, in my own consumption. And, you know, when I was, like you said, young and at KCD and, you know, I, you know, got discounts on clothes where people would give me things, but I also spent a ton of money because I thought it was important to have expensive bags and to have expensive shoes. And now I look at the things that I bought and I think, A, it didn't last forever. And also it just wasn't, it just, it's, it's, you know, you then, you know, go and you're cleaning out your closet so that you have more space. And then you think, you know, as we all know that now to resale is such a big deal. And like you get it for, you sell these things for pennies on the dollar, not, you know, sometimes not even, sometimes not even pennies on the dollar, you know, so I think it's, I think it's a, and I don't think that's probably, that's probably isn't reflected in the show. And that probably isn't reflected in, you know, as we see on the red carpet, we see, you know, we see sports figures who, you know, that's a very short shelf life of that, of that, of that career. And you can make a lot of money but, you know, it doesn't last forever. Or, you know, we think of, of, you know, this, this, this decadence and this consumption that is, that is embodied by a lot of these lifestyles. And I think especially, you know, in a time when we, whenever one is really talking about money and we're talking about, are we on the brink of a recession and we're talking about, you know, how do we look at how we, the footprint, the footprint that we occupy and also the legacy that we leave. I think it's a really, I think there, I think there's a lot of really interesting narratives that exist around this show and the ideas that are presented in this show that I am kind of interested in examining and knowing what other people think about. Yeah, I think the show doesn't go where you, where you want it to go. And I have felt, Andrew mentioned Andre in his Andrew Bolton, the chief curator who Andrew Bolton mentioned Andre when he was talking about the exhibition, which he co-curated with this partner, Professor Monica Miller, who wrote the book. He wrote the book in 2009 book about, Yes. How's the fashion it's called. Yes, exactly. Which I think is a fantastic title, but I can see where the method didn't use it. No, yes. And it was interesting because Andrew essentially said, I started thinking about this after Andre died. And I didn't, I didn't know him at all. I met him a couple of times, like I went to events and met him and had some interactions with him. I will say like my personal interactions with him were stressful. Like there were things, like he was, there were times, you know, this was not a person who lived an easy life at the end of his life. And I thought about like, oh, what if he was here and he was able to see how much like he mattered to culture. And I, he probably knew a little bit and was told that sometimes, but I think it, it felt like, oh man, that's kind of, it's kind of a bummer that this is happening now. I think that's true. I also think that, you know, what is, and you've had enough exposure to, you probably more than I, but, but, you know, we've had enough exposure to people in the news or these figures who, I think, who know that they're complicated. They're complicated. I think some people do a really good job of being conscious of what their legacy is or at least what they're, what they project and what that means to people. And they do a very good job of, you know, making sure that all the corners are squared so that, you know, people, you know, they give the fans what they want. I think, but when you, when you get, you know, familiar, I don't want to say familiarity breeds contempt, but I think that getting to know anyone, especially people who have either achieved a lot or people who are brilliant or people, they can be a handful. And so I think, you know, I think, like you said, I think that there's, it was not easy at the end of his life, but I think that Andre was, I think he was incredibly, I think he was a really complicated character. And so I think that, I mean, and as we know, and I quoted Vanessa Friedman in my article, who I think is really brilliant. And, and I think, but I think that she, when she was talking about, you know, Andre's, Andre's final book, his, the Chiffon trenches, which I, which created, which was a bestseller and got a lot of attention. And I got a lot of attention because he dished, and I think, and dished maybe isn't even the right word. I think that he, it seems like there was a bit of, you know, it's interesting in the, the, the forward to that book, he sort of talks about, he really talks about blackness and he talks about Beyonce's cover, Beyonce's last cover, the one, I think where she's hanging, I can't remember what year it is, but the, you know, she's, you know, it's sort of natural light and, and, you know, it's very little artifice and talks about sort of the significance of the clothing line and, you know, the, the, the, the sort of the black woman as the washer woman. And now she's Beyonce, you know, sort of representing as the most famous celebrity in the world. And, and, and what a moment that was. And I think that, you know, and the, I mean, Andre was always very, you know, very, very honest about his, his background. But I think, you know, this was probably, you know, a moment of real, of real retrospection and introspection for him. And, and, and that's how he sort of leads into the chiffon trenches. But, you know, I think that was also one of the reasons that that book got as much attention as it did is that he was, you know, he, he, I think he talked quite openly about his, his dissatisfaction with people and, and the people who had let him down or, and I think that he was not speaking about, he was not, he was not viewing his, you know, all of his, his life experience and, and perhaps, perhaps the decisions that he'd made, but also the things that had happened to him or been done to him as rosely as, as one, as, as we would hope for the, for the end of our lives. I think it had curdled a little bit, maybe. I don't know if I don't know what his, his experience was at the very end of his life. I think, you know, my hope is that when I come to the very end of my life, I just am able to let it all go and forgive everybody. And maybe that was, maybe that was the case for him. But I think in those, those, in that, that, that, those sort of penultimate, that sort of penultimate chapter, it was not that. Yeah, it's interesting now, thinking back, we should move on to the red carpet. And I think this, this gives people something to think about that maybe in some of the other coverage they haven't been considering. And everyone who has a platform, you should invite Bonnie to come talk to you about this, because I think, I think you have a lot of interesting things to say, but I'm just remembering now when he died, because it ran on airmail. It was published first on airmail and the comms person at the time at airmail messaged me. And then I talked to Diane on first and bird, because I think she was with him late. And I messaged her and she's just so open and helpful with stuff like that. And she was with him. But it is just a person who was so important to fashion and culture. And I think, I mean, I'm curious, I can't wait to hear when you see the exhibit, what you think. I mean, I think the biggest, the biggest feat is the fact that Andrew and Monic Miller did it together. Yeah. And, you know, most of these exhibitions, it's a lot of work. I'm not trying to undermine what Andrew Bolton does. I think he's really brilliant and kind and tries very hard. But there's more depth to this than usual, because of the fact that you had a person who's a scholar on this particular thing, and then also them working together. It's just like, two is better than one always, and or almost always. Doesn't it also illustrate something that I think that we don't do enough of? And that I think has been one of the major, if I mean, I don't want to put too fine a point on it. But I think if anything has, has where Kandinastin vogue, when, you know, when they were encountering sort of all of their racial reckoning, I mean, it sounds like such a cliche at this point, you know, in 2020, and also 2021, and also 2020, you know, as this was all going on. I mean, I think that fashion, I haven't worked in other industries, so I don't know other industries. I do know fashion. And also, you know, in some ways, I was so desensitized to it, both from how I grew up and also because I just aspired to work in fashion forever. And I had been so kind of fashion-pilled by it and so indoctrinated and like, oh, of course, like, of course, this is, you know, sort of being, you know, surrounded by all these sort of long-legged, you know, heiresses with shiny blonde hair and thinking, oh, of course, like, of course, that's the person who should be, you know, you know, working in that job. And of course, that's, this is what someone who, you know, has their house photograph for the magazine looks like. And of course, this is, you know, it like didn't even occur to me. I mean, I sometimes describe myself as, you know, they're not all the time, but there have been moments where I, if this, we have a child, so this reference will make sense to you, but sometimes I feel like, you know, Babe, who, like the pig who doesn't know that she can't, that she can't, you know, Keral Sheep, where it's like, oh, well, of course, I'm the same as all these people. And it's like, well, you're not, I mean, and in some ways I am, and in some ways I'm not, and in some ways, perhaps I'm better. But, you know, I always think that I'm, you know, one of these people and I'm not. And, or that's not how always how I was viewed. And it didn't occur to me. It's like, well, you know, oh, like, that someone who, you know, looked like they had, you know, come from the country club was more likely to, you know, for image was more likely, not that I know I ever said that to me, but that they were more likely to sort of get the job or to, you know, be assigned the thing or to be that, than I was. And there was kind of nothing I could do about that. But they'd all, but I never felt, I never went immediately to thinking like, oh, are these people racist? I mean, I just never did, or not even racist, but did they have blind spots? It didn't occur to me. And, and because I couldn't prove it, I was sort of, you know, I would just sort of move on. And then when all of a sudden, all this stuff happened in 2020, it was like, oh, wait, wait a second, like, have I been, have I been affected by, by people's sort of narrow mindedness or people's, you know, or, or, you know, sort of out and out bigotry or people's sort of lack of lack of understanding that, that we should have like a more sort of equitable environment in any event. I think, you know, to your point, I think what it says is, you know, we really do benefit from this, you know, we help each other and we point out sensitivities, we point out liabilities, we can say, that's actually not how you would do that, or that's not how that would, it's almost like having a translator. And it's like, you know, so that, you know, there's a difference between the sort of the, you know, the written language or the, or the book language, the book learned language, and the colloquial language, and how do you find and how do you find what the, what sort of dialect or register is the most appropriate. And when we all have people who are exactly like us and we know this in our personal lives and we certainly know it in our work lives, then there can be problems because even the most well-meaning people who think they're doing the right thing because they've done the research or because they, you know, they don't necessarily know how it's going to play with all the different environments. And I'm not thinking of, you know, you think of, I mean, I thought the, the flap about, and Vogue has, has, and I think some of the flaps that Vogue has endured or maybe not necessarily fair, Kamala and, you know, Kamala and Converse, I didn't, I didn't pick that one up. You know, LeBron with, you know, with Giselle, was it Giselle? And, you know, people thinking, yeah, King Kong, I don't know if I would have picked that up, but it's like, you know those Converse, but you know that there was no one who was, who was there having those conversations or saying, hmm, I'm not going to, hmm, I'm not so sure about that. Like I just want, I just want to flag for you guys that this could be perceived this way. They're going to make the decision that they're going to make, but having people work together who come from really, really different backgrounds and then figuring out how they, how they can enhance each other's knowledge is, is, is the best, is the best course of action in almost any endeavor. And that's why I think, you know, Vogue obviously, I mean, no magazine has the, has the cultural influence that it once had, but I think on balance, they probably are better work environments and they're probably better products. It's just unfortunate that they're not, they're not supported by, you know, as much advertising or as much, or as many eyes, but I think that they are, but, but you know, I think that that has been, that has been beneficial to know you've got to bring someone in because if this show had ever been mounted before, and it never would have been, I don't think it ever would have been, not even 10 years ago, then, then I guarantee you that Andrew, do a disrespect to Andrew. And I don't know if Andrew was at Harold Coda before, and it doesn't matter who was, who is, but the likelihood that someone would have said, we're going to bring someone in who has knowledge in this, and we probably need to, if for optics only, we need to bring in someone who, who this is their culture. And, and we're better at that now than we used to be. Yeah, I'll say, and I'll say, and we can use this as a segue to, and this is going to sound really impertinent, but as a segue to the red carpet, you know, I saw a lot of white dinner jackets on the, on the red carpet, and I, as a black woman, thought a lot of white dinner jackets, white dinner jacket looks like a waiter at a country club to me. I love a white dinner jacket, I love a white dinner jacket in the summertime, white dinner jackets totally appropriate for a tuxedo jacket, especially warm climates. This is all stuff that I happen to know. If you go to Palm Beach, you're going to see a lot of white dinner jackets if you go to, but it's like, you know, the first could of round to people that I saw walking in the red carpets, and it's like, who were not black. And it's like, oh, you like, is, I mean, I mean, it's sort of a rude joke, right? That like, oh, I'm, you know, I'm dressed like a man servant. Yeah. It's, oh, it's, you know, these are, these are things like, if someone said to me, Bonnie, what do you think I should wear to the match? I think I would say, I'm not sure about that. I'm not, I'm not sure about something that's going to make you look like, if you're, if you're in tribute to black men, I'm not sure if you should look like something where you might be mistaken for a waiter. That's what I would say. Yeah. Maybe not my answer, maybe it's not the right answer. But it's like, it was something, it's something that I would introduce at least for consideration. It's interesting because the great Jessica Jaffee, who is fabulous to follow on social media when she's doing red carpet commentary, meant, referred to Sabrina Carpenter's look, which is like a brownish, brown, like a hot pan, like a jacket with a hot pan, which is as, as a, as a, looking like it was a uniform from Panera Bread. Totally. Which is truly hilarious. Maybe less, less on historical context. Exactly.

So the only thing that I do want to say about the last thing I want to say about the, and again, I haven't been and I did and I sort of said that in my newsletter today. It's just that like I'm going to reserve judgment. The one thing that I, the one myth that I'm going to say about the one myth that I'm going to say about the one myth that I'm going to today, it's just that like I'm going to reserve judgment. The one thing that I, the one myth or the one thing that I hope that this I hope, you know, if we sort of look at learnings from this particular, I hope this is a success. And I hope that it inspires really interesting conversations, and I hope that it magnetizes a whole new, a whole different group of people and young men and young people who, you know, connect with something that, you know, it's, maybe aren't going to be as excited that's something that is referencing, you know, from previous themes where you're going to see a lot of costumes or you're going to see a lot of, you know, apparel from like 17th century France, which is maybe not as interesting to kids from Harlem or kids from, you know, a story of Queens or kids from, you know, Red Hook or wherever. You know, it doesn't have to just be just, you know, black and brown kids. It should be everybody. But I think, which is the beautiful part of New York. But I think the one thing is, you know, for a May show, for the Gala show, to have some, you know, sort of men's like kind of sartorial dress and haberdashery and to have something that's so male focused, I hope that it still magnetizes the crowds because I think people want, I think one of the reasons that the, that, you know, obviously there's this huge red carpet event that supports it. But the May show is often about fantasy and it's about what people think of as fashion, you know, capital F fashion. And you see, I mean, I think McQueen is still, is still the record breaking show because that, you know, those clothes, particularly because those clothes, many of those clothes, most of those clothes never went to production. And because Lee was such an incredible, I mean, I remember I work, I mean, I saw this close of clothes because I was working at KCD then, so I would be backstage and you'd see these incredible, incredible, incredible clothes. And, you know, I think, you know, to have something that maybe has these culturally significant, but doesn't give you as much impact, I hope that doesn't, I hope the stewards of the Met, I hope that doesn't scare them away from something that has such a clear, like, clear identification with, you know, sort of with a group and with a particular group, and perhaps draws in a particular group. And that it doesn't, it's not saying anything about the potential for, you know, giving space for these kinds of ideas. I think this show is going to be huge. I really do. I really do. I'm glad to hear it. I wish, you know, but I do wish there was obviously more women's fashion, because that's what I'm most. Well, the other issue is, look, like, I'm all for everybody wearing whatever they want to wear. I don't particularly like, I've said this before, it's not that I only think Willa Bennett, who's now an editor in chief of Cosmo, looks good in ties. I think women should wear whatever they want. I don't love most fashion looks. I would say I don't like fashion looks on women or people wearing women's clothes that include ties. I'm going to stop you because whenever someone says, and this is a sentence construction that I use all the time, I'm all for means I'm not really for it. I just don't like it. And the thing is, I'm not, it feels like a thing. And tonight, sort of helped me understand why. I'll say it so you don't have to. It's stupid. It never looks good. It never looks good. I mean, I have to say, Zoe Buckman, the artist Zoe Buckman, when I first met her, she was, which was many years ago, she was wearing sort of a, I think it was like a salaroff for women, like a salaroff suit and a white shirt and like a little, sort of like a little bow tie, like a, it's like a hair tie bow tie, not like a foreign hand tie. But like, and she looked so fantastic. And she sort of had this short, perky hair and she's got a great sound. She's great looking. And, you know, had a heel and she's, you know, and she's like, you know, you've got this sort of like, kind of boyish, sort of, you know, like very slim build and sort of narrow shoulders. And it worked so well on her. And I was sitting with her husband at the time. And we were at this gala that my friend Pipa invited us to. And I was sitting here with her and I said, you know what, I said, your wife, and I just met him. And I said, and I just met them. And I said, your wife has fantastic style. And she looks as good as I've ever seen a woman looking at suit. And he was like, yeah, she's great. And so I think it worked, but it felt, it felt feminine and it felt chic and it felt and it had a precedent of, you know, of sort of how do we make this work for a woman? It wasn't, it wasn't a costume. And I think women in like something that is, I think you have to figure out a way of easing it up so that it has, that it still feels flattering because I have to say, you know, there are a lot of, a lot of people. It's, it's funny. The women who went for, so, okay, so I'll, so the first thing that I'm gonna say is I understand that there was the directive that was given, it's like tailored to you, which felt very, didn't feel very bogued. It felt very, it felt like it felt very sticky to me. But you know, tailored, tailored to, it felt very like, you know, when, when blooming tales, even they would do like a tie in with a movie, and then they would do the wind burst and it felt very bad. And I was like, that doesn't feel bogued. Vogue usually feels, you know, they, it felt a bit dumbed down to me. But I understand people, it's, it's confusing particularly because this is like all the complaints that I just registered about, you know, it's, it's, you know, where are the women in this? But I think it's really interesting because sort of understanding the theme, I think the men who leaned more towards this really kind of flamboyant, is it gay? Is it not gay? I don't know. Is it queer? Not queer? I don't know. It doesn't really matter. But the men who did that looked dynamite. And the women who leaned more towards the really sort of like polished, like I'm gonna wear other than the kind of zootsuits, but a zootsuit again has that really has that has that that verve. The, the women who leaned into the very kind of structured, a lot of Tom Brown, obviously, we know, you know, Tom's a genius, but there's, but I think they are the ones who looked the most foolish. Yes. It's really interesting, like it was, it was really interesting that the men who, who, you know, who, who really, and I think for, for this, but the, so I'll also go and say the thing that I think it missed is that it became this very kooky creative black tie. And I think if you are going to do black style, you have to have color. And I think that the people who missed out on doing color, by and large, blew it. Yep. I think even Andrew Scott, who I think, I mean, looks crazy. It's like a brown shirt and a red vest and a mint green suit. I mean, the colors, the color sense is, and like this weird like spectators. I mean, the outfit is crazy, but it's like, you know what? I love it. He did it. Yeah. He did it. He showed up. He showed up. He totally showed up. Patrick Schwarzenegger looked amazing, like that yellow kind of surplus, like tied shirt and that like, and that crazy, like everyone's got a wide leg pant today, which is very 40s. And I think that, so that, and that feels, you know, that feels right. So the 30s, 40s sort of Malcolm X, like conk tear. I mean, like that really worked. But there was not a normal, except for, can I also say, I know I'm hopping around, then if you were wearing a normal tuxedo, just like a normal sort of suit of evening clothes, how many men talk to your tailor to get the pant length right? So that the pant breaks where it's supposed to break. There are so many no man's pants fit. No, so many men, we're just going to do a straight, like flat front pleated pant, doesn't make a difference to me, but don't look like you're wearing a rented tuxedo. That is so embarrassing. And I also have to say, this one always drives me crazy. Like, like I got a little bit, you know, I sort of have been obsessed with clothes since I was little. So I sort of know like all of the rules that nobody pays attention to anymore. Like, you know, you're not the only group Swiss, it's just a dress watch, like a gold watch. So you're not supposed to wear your like Rolex Submariner or whatever, if you're wearing evening clothes, fine. Nobody does that anymore. But people don't probably don't even wear watches. But the number of men wearing tuxedos, wearing the wrong shoe, I have seen there are so many wrong shoes. I mean, they might as well be wearing Doc Martens. Get a norm like a tuxedo pump, get the right shoe. You know, who has the right shoes on tonight is Michael Kors. Of course he does. Michael looks fantastic. Michael looks great. Michael looks fantastic. I mean, Michael looks amazing. I mean, but look at Steve Schwartzman's shoes. I think he's wearing a patent sneaker. It's the same, it blew my mind. There is a football player that my colleague Peter Hamby was very excited about his look, wearing sneakers. Let me look up his name. Joe Burrow. It's out of control. Okay, so really, really quickly, I just want to say that Andrew Scott is is wearing this Italian fashion label. I really like that I've never pronounced it before. And I think it's it's G I U L I V A heritage. Julie, the G I U. Yeah, I see the heritage or I'm sorry, everyone. I really respect you. He looks fab. I believe Patrick Schwarzenegger was wearing wheat on. I want to go through a couple specific looks. But first of all, let's just tell everybody, you don't have to wear pinstripe. The thing that bothered me the most was that literally everybody who was like, nervous about the theme wore pinstripe and some of it looks great. A lot of it looked really bad in the same way. A lot of the ties didn't look right. And it's like, I just think like you have this opportunity to be on this red carpet. You are going to be seen by millions of people potentially, but also like, you're invited to this incredible thing. Many of you are not paying for your ticket. Your ticket was thousands of dollars. Just put in the effort and like, think about it. Put in the effort. But right before I right before I got him with you, I was with talking to my friend, Danny Shea, who was saying that he thinks the only thing, because we were saying, is there a way to really mess it up? Is there a way to gaff so badly that you're cancelled, given the fact that, you know, given all of it? And he said, and we decided we don't think there is, but he said, I think here to not do nothing, to not go for it. You know, the people who just, look, if you're a billionaire, if you're, you know, if you're Steve Shortsman or you're, I probably don't want to see you in a zoot suit. I probably, like, you know, that I get, you know, over a certain age or of a certain, you know, if you, that makes sense to me. Like, don't, there are certain people for whom it's silly to take a risk. But what Danny was saying, and I totally agree, he's like, if you, if you haven't taken a risk, you've lost, you've lost, you've blown it for something like this. And like, you will, because it also, it's a bit like when you go to a costume party and you're like, oh, costume party. I'm just, I don't like wearing a costume. Like, I feel most comfortable in my own clothes. I'm going to go in my own clothes. And then you show up and you have a worse time than you would have if you were just wearing some things. If you just, you know, bought, you know, some rabbit ears and, you know, if you, if you just participated a little bit, you'll get a stick in the month. Yeah. So I totally agree with you. I think, and again, I think, you know, even the sensitivity, like you said, I'm sure there was some sensitivity, you kind of couldn't get it wrong. I think that there are, I think people should have pushed the pinstripes. Yes, I think that that was too safe. And I think there's a lot of black. I'm surprised that there's so much black that Anna didn't give because Anna, we were always tashed whenever, you know, when I worked on the other side, when I was on the PR side, Anna hates black, Anna won't shoot black. And like, Anna loves that dress. Can you have your aches à l'oeil make it in canary yellow? Yeah. And it's like, oh, when do you need it? Oh, we need in 36 hours. Okay, great. You know, we'll fire up the, you know, we'll fire up the sewing machines in Milan. So tell me, give me like three of your favorites and why? I, Patrick Schwarzenegger, I just loved, I loved the color, I loved it. Like, it just worked. Like, it isn't necessary. Like, it's kind of, because it's just, it's, because it's out there, and it's taking a risk. And he's such a handsome guy. And we were handsome, you can kind of get away with anything, I think. He is very handsome. He's very handsome. He's very, I mean, he looks like a model. But I think I just loved that it was, because there was, like I said, there was color, and the color was kind of off. You don't see men in canary yellow. You don't see any, with this sort of maroon kind of ox blood, like it doesn't really make sense. But it's great. And I think it's, and you can, you can see a black guy wearing that. Like, you can. I mean, that's what I loved about it. I mean, it's sort of like, he, like, it's, it's the theme, but it's not the theme, but it's not so, it's not so on the nose. That it, that I think it really worked. And it's like, you're having fun with it. You're having fun with it, but not in a, but not in a way that is creating spectacle. It's in a way that is very fashion. Like you want to see fashion. Like, and I think that sometimes these, you know, people wear these very elaborate, these, you know, very, but obviously, there's artistry. You obviously have the, the, the virtuosity of both the creative director and the, you know, the many like, who are, who are putting together these incredible, incredible counts. But there's a little bit too much folly in it. It's not fun. It's closed. They're difficult to get up the stairs. You think, how are they going to eat in that? Like it just, it feels, it feels like they're trying too hard. It feels like everybody, other than, than creating a spectacle, isn't giving you anything. So that's what I liked about him. I really liked Adrian Brody. Oh my God, I hated it. Oh, you hated it. I like, I thought he looked insane. I was like, these two are, I didn't, I didn't think it was right for, I would have liked to, I would have liked to see like John David Washington and something like that. But I also think, I think it would have been interesting for, if he had played with color, if, if it had been like, you know, like an orange shirt and like a royal blue, like we need the Dion Sanders. Like we need that, like we need that. We need the Andre 3000. Like we need that, like it needs to be like punchy and you see fun and you need to look like they're having fun, not just like, I'm wearing sort of a new fangle tuxedo. So I liked, but, but I liked the lines of it. I thought it was really beautiful. I didn't, I don't think it worked. He wasn't the right person to wear it, but I did like that. Like I can see right now. You know what, when I look at it, I actually like the look. You're right. It is a good look. I just like don't like it on him for some reason, but of course I can't find out what brand he was wearing. Maybe Sellerat because, because no one did any credits except for who would wear. Thank you, Hillary and team. Objectively, I liked it. I just didn't like it for tonight. I have to say Jeremy O'Harris looked amazing. Fantastic. It was cultural. It was smart. It was historical. It was, I thought it was great. I thought it was absolutely great. They looked fantastic. Mark Jacobs doing Cab Calloway. I thought was really interesting. I didn't, you know, I don't love a cream suit. I thought the sort of conch tear was really interesting. I mean, he's copy, it's dressed in Cab Calloway, but that was really interesting. I thought, I loved Tyler Perry. I thought Tyler Perry looked in cred. I have a good relationship with Tyler Perry. I'm probably one of the few people in fashion. Well, maybe not the few people in fashion, but I'm probably one of the few people. I'm one of the few people that people I know, know who's seen just about every Tyler Perry movie. I've seen many of them in the theater. I have a very complicated relationship with them. If I were in, I often say had I studied what I studied in college just 20 years later, I would have written all my papers about, I studied modern culture and media would have written all my papers about Tyler Perry and his relationship to sort of women and black culture and a bunch of other things, which would certainly not earn me any kudos from Tyler Perry. But I loved, this is where, again, I mean, to go back to, like, you gotta have people who get it, who get what, who get what it's about, who get what the references are, who get what it, who get, even just like, I think people who did hats, like there were ways to incorporate this. I thought it's like Tracee Ellis Ross and she did all those, like, those, even though it was this weird, exaggerated suit. I mean, the hat is so important. People who did like a walking stick, even though a walking stick is super weird and not practical, but they did, you know, they incorporated those elements that showed that you were able to, you were able to take enough of the details and enough that you actually, you wanted to have some interface with what this, with what this, this theme was. Yeah. So I loved him. His was sort of like these kind of, not ecclesiastical garments, because that's the wrong term, but it was like, I mean, it felt like church, it felt like sort of the, the sort of the, I mean, he felt like a, I mean, it's probably his God complex, but it sort of felt like, like this is, he's a preacher, like he's up at the, he's up at the pulpit, like he's gonna, he's gonna lay hands on you, he's gonna save you. I loved that. I thought, and it was beautiful. You could see the work on it. I loved it. Jeff Goldblum too. It's like, he kind of looks like a dictator, but it's like, you've got to, like, there's gotta be some panache. There's gotta be something, there's gotta be something, like if you're, if you're stepping on that red carpet and you're not doing something, like, like, look at these, like, look at the marching bands or look at the, look at church, look at church choirs, look at, they're wearing shiny, they're wearing purple, they're wearing gold, they're wearing, like, it's, it's exuberant, it's, it's, it's joyful, it's, it's colorful, it's in your face, it doesn't necessarily have to match, it doesn't necessarily, and if you didn't do that, then I don't, like, if you didn't show that you're having a little bit of fun, and because Black culture is, is fundamentally, even the sort of the dandy and even, even this sort of resistance of, of, of being in dialogue with, you know, with the sort of hegemonic, like, white culture and white forms of dress, it still has joy. If you think about the, you know, the, the people that we've seen, you know, through the last couple of decades who really are invested with often men, who really are investing in their looks, like I said, Dionne Sanders, Andre 3000, Andre, they do not take themselves seriously, and that is, I think, what's missing from, from the, the outfits, even though I can technically appreciate them, the ones that are just black and white, or that are just, you know, that are, that are pinstripes, or that are plaid, or that are just, or just tuxedos, or some, some kind of version of a tuxedo, you're not showing us the fun, you're not showing us the joy, you're not showing us the excitement, you're not showing us the swagger. I, I agree, the thing about color is so important. I would say anyone who wore Oswald Boateng, which Coleman Domingo had him a suit of his on at the preview and looked amazing. And then Coleman Domingo wore black and white, but looked amazing. And Valentino, like 15 different textures and colors, but the Henry Golding, a person who I find extremely annoying, generally, just as his, like, being looked amazing. He was wearing Oswald Boateng, a couple other- In sort of a, it was like a sort of mustard pinstripe. Yes. Like anyone who showed up in Oswald Boateng looked, Oswald Boateng also looked amazing. Like that was the brand, that was the brand. If you were going to wear something, I also thought, like I went, I made a list, like I thought Demi Moore looked great in Tom Brown. I thought Edward Eninfool looked amazing. I think- Edward looked great. Edward, because I think Edward was the one, Edward was the one who could pull as sort of like the pre-eminent black man in fashion as an African. He, I think, to do that really, really, really proper sort of like was able to colonize that look. And he was going to own it and he was going to look the best in it. Totally. Kale's and he, like that was, that was his look. That was his, his and his alone, I think. And he looks, and he looks fantastic. He looked awesome. I said, Kalaam, Callum, Turner, Hot could literally wear whatever, but do a leap in here so hot she did not look good. I don't know what's going on with her look. It's all these, like what are these, what are these like head to toe, no matter how much works, no matter how many tuthers, no matter how many sequins, no matter how many sheer panels. It's just not giving you, it's not giving you what you want to eat, what you want to give. Totally. I thought Jordan Castile and Charles Harveston, there's a big piece in The Times about that, her dress. She looked gorgeous, was wearing blue. Who else? Leon Bridges was wearing this British designer. Leon Bridges looked amazing. Nicholas Daly, I was totally obsessed with it. Just an FYI, Adrian Brody is in fear of God. And I think the real, the reason I didn't like, I literally wore the same exact outfit on, on Sunday. Like exactly. There was very little different about my outfit on Sunday night. And he stole your look. No, I got it. I totally got it. You know, I thought, I thought Ace of Rocky looked pretty good. I thought Tyler Richard. I didn't understand the outer wear on top. Like I wish he had, had chucked the, had chucked the jacket. Gabrielle and Dwayne looked amazing. Of course. And they matched, they matched, which was great. And Swizz Beats and Alicia Keys, they looked bananas. They looked insane, but it was awesome. You know what? Yeah. Yeah. Like that's exactly, like if you're gonna, like there, really there is, like as I, as I said before, like the only failure is to not, is just to do nothing. And if you, especially if there's a coordination. Yeah. And there is a, and it doesn't really make any sense. And you don't get it. And you're like, tell me about your, like, and, and you're, and you don't care if you look, you're not trying to look, you know, it's, you're not trying to look. I mean, I think they probably loved how they looked, but they're not, but they're, they're giving you, they're giving you something and they know they're doing something. They're not trying to play it safe. And I love that. Speaking of which, I also want Melody Hobson. I want Melody Hobson to be wearing the most expensive dress in the place. Like I always, I mean, I'd like, I get, she's, I wanted something different from her. I wanted color from her. I wanted, I mean, I think she's so impressive. I wanted like, I wanted her to be wearing orange or I wanted her to be wearing, I don't know. I agree. Like I wanted to, I wanted to, that's what I wanted. Like a real shining moment for her. Cola Skola in who's, maybe it's Eskola. I don't know. I didn't understand the print it felt. And I think also the, the sort of glam looked a little Viennese or something. Yeah. Cola Skola is, it's like, they went for it. Yeah. Christopher, wearing Christopher John Rogers, which I think is cool. I mean, look, like there was a lot, there was a lot of, a lot of people made an effort. People could have thought a little harder. I did enjoy Monica Babarro's Edwardian suit situation. If you're going to do a, it's a, it was Dior. It was not like, it was the least offensive to me of the, the dumb suits. And I agree with you that Tracy Ellis Ross looked great. I thought that Cynthia Rivo and custom Givenchy looked incredible. Like it was a really, really amazing look. And she always nails it. Like I just think she has a really amazing presence on the red carpet. And I, I like seeing, I'm excited to see what she's going to wear. I also liked for her, it seemed to me, maybe it's because she wasn't wearing frittant. I think she, it was the least fussy. It's quite the most like clothes. Yes. But you could see the work, you could see her incredible body. Like it, but it felt, and obviously she wasn't dressed like Alpha, but like there was, she didn't need to hang on any sort of, sort of reference to the, the project she was working on. And I, I think it felt, this is something that I liked. She always gives you something that's very, very, very theatrical. Which I tend not to be as, as, you know, I'm always looking for like what I wear about or, or could that be worn by someone else? But I, I thought that, yeah, I thought she looked great. I thought, I thought Simone Biles, I have to say, I mean, she was giving full Jean Benet, which, God bless her. You know, we don't expect the athletes to, they have, it's not what, the way the athletes were there. Although I thought Serena looked great. And I thought Benes looked great. I, yeah, I thought, I thought Serena looked especially good, but yeah, they both look good. Speaking of Jean Benet, somebody mentioned that Sabrina Carpenter's hair is giving Jean Benet, and it's so true. She really needs to change, change the hair. I mean, absolutely. I mean, a hundred percent Jean Benet, although weirdly, I think Jean Benet would be older than, yeah, Jean Benet would be real when Sabrina Carpenter. Oh my God. Very creepy. Very creepy. Which is, which is weird to think about. Okay. I have two more, and then you should do your final thoughts, and we should go because, because this is a, also anyone is interested, I'm going to be on jam session today talking red carpet with Amanda Dobbins as well, if you want more red carpet. But I thought Ayo had a berry in, you know, Max, who's the designer at Farragamo did a bunch of different people. I thought the most, the best look was Ayo, and I love that she's been like showing her boobs, which she doesn't do a lot. And speaking of other, like, and it was just like a beautiful tailored look that was not a suit and very cool and interesting. And I thought she looked amazing. I didn't get it. You don't like it? It's not that I didn't like it. I just didn't get it. One thing that I have to say about Farragamo though, thank God they finally picked a designer who's not making anoraks. Did you notice that all their shows at every single runner show, was like an anorak? I wonder if there was like one of the family members was like, please make an anorak. Please make an anorak. There was always an anorak. I mean, there was always like, and there's nothing I hate more than a jacket with a zipper. This is a brand that should not, that's a story. That's a story for another episode. The one final thing I will say is had nothing to do with the theme, but I thought Miley Cyrus looked really good in a lie. I can't help it. I just was really, she looked awesome. She looked incredible. She looked incredible. But again, like it's like if this were, if this were, I mean, everyone looked like they were in mourning ever. And I think that that was just a huge missed opportunity because it's going to be a sea of, I mean, look, we're all getting the pictures now. We don't need to pick up an issue of Vogue in six weeks to see what people wore. And we wouldn't do that anyway. But I just, I don't know. I just like, there was a lot of black. Because when I think about the people who wore color or did something interesting, even to me, you know, that was black and white, but even like, that's what I remember in my mind, everything else, all of the black dresses all completely blend into one. So. Bonnie, thank you so much for being here. Do you have a final thought on your day of Met Gala and Met and Costume Institute? My final thought is, you know, every year, I wonder, you know, we have so many red carpet events and there are so many award shows and there are so many. And I always think, is this going to be the year that the Met Gala, you know, that we sort of, like, that we sort of put it in the continuum of like, how culturally relevant is it? You know, it's fun, but I think, I think that the meaning of the Met is still evolving. And I think that I feel grateful that this is the year I'm really curious to know how the show, actually how people actually react to the show. This will be a year that I'm really paying attention to that. And to see, like, you know, what resonance, you know, does this have any, any other resonance or effect on how we view fashion and how we view sort of who belongs in fashion and who has an influence on fashion. I think this is actually an opportunity that we haven't had, you know, we've had Carl, we've had, you know, we've spotlighted, you know, designers or countries or, and I think that this may be, you know, let's see what this leads to. Because I think it could potentially be something more meaningful than whatever attempts we've made about trying to either sort of integrate fashion or, or analyze, you know, the, the, the influence of all these sort of disparate voices. I don't want to be overly optimistic or overly, or over define it. But, you know, I hope the conversation continues and I'm really curious to see it. I'm really curious to see what, you know, what other people think about it. And, and hopefully, there'll be interesting, there'll be interesting, you know, conversations and, and conclusions that come from that. So, we'll see. Ronnie, thank you so much. This was so fun. This is also the longest podcast we've ever recorded. So congratulations. Cut it in half. I don't, I don't know. No, no, no. It was awesome. It was so good. We won't cut that much. It was, it was great though. I really appreciate you taking so much time and doing it last minute. It means a lot. But you should come back because this was so good. I would love to. Thank you so much. Fashion People is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck. This show was produced and edited by Molly Nugent.

It was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out. It was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself?
