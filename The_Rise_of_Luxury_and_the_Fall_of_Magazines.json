I hope you had a great Halloween. We had a very fun time trick or treating in Brooklyn and running into some people, including some very good friends we didn't expect to see, which was nice. Like baby, know me. Very glad my kid has yet to request that we wear costumes, but he is our kid. So maybe he'll never do that. Here's hoping. I had a very busy week as I promised. I did go to most of the things that I RSVP to after the CFDAs. There was a bunch of stuff on Tuesday. I went to WSJ innovators. I went to this gala at the Perlman Art Center, I believe it's called downtown that was sponsored by Promptomp, which is opening down there in spring 2025, like right across the street from our offices. So I got to see the folks from there, which was really nice and smart of them to sponsor that event. I also went to this dinner that Christina O'Neill, who's the editor in chief of Sotheby's magazine and runs all of their editorial, did with this brand called Lafayette 148. I met Emily, their creative director, she's been there for a long time. It's a really interesting brand that is sort of like, has always been around, but people are really noticing it. So it's really nice. What is it? This like design studio and very chic. So I did that before I went up to innovators, which is like super fun. And I had a great time. There was lots of cool, famous people and people made great speeches and Salma Hayek was hilarious. Penelope Cruz was wonderful. You just had to be there. You know, you can just look online and watch the videos. I'm not going to explain that stuff to you right now. And then on Wednesday night, I hosted my own dinner, a puck private dinner with Belmont Village, Belmont Heart Village. Actually, it's called Long Story. But if you've ever been to Bister Village outside of London, and I feel like anyone who spent any time in London very much knows about Bister Village. It's where like all the really fancy outlet stores are. It's not an outlet mall. You don't think you can call it that? It's like a beautiful shopping center that happens to have outlet stores that are very nice. It's like the most amazing experience ever. They're building the same thing here. The guy who owns it is also a part owner in New York Rangers, the hockey team that has that big stadium out in UBS Stadium out in Belmont. And so there's just like a bunch of cool stuff happening there. There's race tracks are getting like redone. Super fun and fancy. And the dinner and the idea was like they just want to be more in the mix and they want people to know what they're doing. So I invited a bunch of CEOs and execs that I really like and who are cool. And represent the future of the industry here. And then I also invited like a lot of people who do interesting things in the industry that would love to engage with CEOs and executives. And thank you to my friend Chris who, who helped me come up with the list for free because he is one of these people who's quote unquote cool, but who can also sit and hang out with execs. He was sadly not in town. He was at Atlanta for some air mess thing. But anyway, long story. Glenda Bailey was also there, the former editor and chief of Harper's Bazaar. And she works with Belmont on projects and she's just like very fun and has a positive energy and it was, it was a really lovely evening. We had a great time. Thank you to everyone who showed up and stayed late and everyone ate their sticky toffee pudding ice cream Sundays. So I was extremely impressed. Uh, this week on line sheet, Rachel Struegatz absolutely creamed the competition with Estee Lauder coverage. Think that I mentioned probably earlier in the week that the CEO stepping down and they were naming the new CEO and everybody thought it was going to be this guy, Stefan and ended up being this guy, Stefan, but Jane Lauder, who had also been in the running in the last like air of the Estee Lauder fortune to be a working executive at the company and is like very well regarded. Well, like she actually stepped down. And so Rachel just, you know, she's doing, she's covering this better than anyone and knows more than anyone else. So enjoy that. She ran that on Wednesday. And then on Thursday, I did a piece kind of follow up from my Monday thing about Alexander Arnaud and his sort of connections to Trump. And a lot of that, the feedback I got from that piece actually ended up being like, well, how is he doing? Why does he live in the U S? How is Tiffany doing? So I just did a sort of analysis of like how it's been since he got there. As Luca Soka said on the podcast a couple of weeks ago, like generally the, the business has done well and they've done a good job, but they might not have been as fast growing as they thought. But you know what? There was one thing I forgot to mention in there that I've heard a lot of these jewelry brands, like Tiffany Cartier types are basically taking over factories for four years. They are placing orders four years ahead. They're, the production is so high. So it was an interesting, I just like did an analysis of what he's done. I think he's really crucial part of that company. And there's a reason he's in the U S and it's an important role. So you should definitely check that out. I also asked, why hasn't Kim Kardashian endorsed anyone? Kind of get into that. And then I also had a little scoop about the Australian designer, Deon Lee, who seems to be doing some different stuff now and, and moving ahead after his company filed for like the equivalent of bankruptcy protection in Australia. So sadly not going to be back in Los Angeles for the Laqumagala, but I hope you all have a wonderful time. I can't wait to hear about it. Meanwhile, let's get started with Amanda. She's one of the best in the biz. And I initially wanted to have her on to discuss her recent piece on the print magazine revival. And we talked about that quite a bit, but we also ended up talking about luxury pricing and what works at what doesn't. She has a really interesting career. She was the managing editor of the like handbag forum. And they also, they had a blog and she wrote about handbags for 10 years. And then she ended up getting a job on the health desk at the Atlantic. And she's just, she's really, really great reporter and a really fabulous writer. And we talked a lot about like how to get into journalism if you don't have the sort of traditional path. So if you're interested in that, you'll like that, that little aside as well. But let's get going. And I hope to see you all about in New York this weekend. Amanda Mall, welcome to fashion people. Thank you so much for having me. You know, longtime listener, first time caller. Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you for listening. So first question on Friday morning show, what did you have for breakfast? I had one of those terrible, wonderful core power chocolate protein shake things. I haven't had a shake in a long time. How was it? They're good. They're like milk based instead of being like weird, like whey protein powder based. So they taste like a little bit like just a chocolate milkshake. I'm often not super hungry in the morning. So it's like, you know, you get something in there without really feeling like you eat anything. So I have been doing that a lot, even though like they're, you know, it's weird franken food, but you do what you have to. Okay. Two points on that one is, did you ever have carnation instant breakfast when you were a little? Yes. Yes. I went through phases like I have always been like this. I don't really love breakfast food and I'm not always hungry in the mornings, but my mom would drive herself insane. Feeling like she had not mothered me if I didn't eat something in the morning. So there was like long stretches where that was just like what I had. Yeah. I love breakfast food, but I go through phases of things and I eat the same thing for like that. I don't eat breakfast as much as I used to either, but like I'll go through like seven years of eating if I eat breakfast, the same exact thing. And when I was younger, I definitely went through a carnation instant breakfast phase, but it really is just was a milkshake, which great. It was delicious. And then the second point is on the sort of protein powder situation. Have you tried the David protein bars? I have not, I have not seen one sort of like show up in real life. Like if I saw one at a store, I would buy it and try it, but I haven't, I haven't encountered one yet. Okay. A few things. One is A has Bloomberg done, Bloomberg Business Week, done a story on these protein bar wars. So you need to do this story. The protein bars are like very much on my radar. I haven't done one. We have some great like CPG beat writers who I have to, I'll have to check in with them to see what they think. Two things. One is you should look also look into the fiber wars that are just starting. This is a recurring theme in my coverage. I'm very interested in the fiber wars. It's going to start. Everybody's going to start talking about fiber constantly on the fiber front. Bloomberg has, um, they have like a great snack situation at the office, uh, yes, in Manhattan and I have gotten totally addicted to, um, Kashi cereal. Um, they have like the cinnamon crunch version there and I eat a little free bowl of that every morning and it's got so much fiber in it. And so I'm like, this is not just eating whatever I see in front of me. This is fiber. This is good for me. Yeah. I need to eat my fiber. Uh, I've been to that office a couple of times and it is a really nice, like iced coffee situation. There's just a lot going on there. So on the David bars. So we ordered the pack to test and I have an, I used to be really into these. Ugh. Forget what the brand was. It was that, um, do you remember when people were eating coffee with butter a lot? Yeah. But yeah, what was that called? The brand bullet proof bullet proof. So bullet proof made bars and this is pre COVID because I basically haven't eaten any type of like food like that since COVID because I moved to LA and I don't get hungry because I never move. So I don't need to have snacks. Whereas pre COVID, I would need a snack a lot and I don't like eating a lot of those bars because they're like filled with sugar or just like crap or fake sugar or whatever bullet proof did this bar that was like, it definitely had a little fake sugar in it, but not a lot and it was delicious. They were so good. I think they phased them out and discontinued them. But so these David bars, I was very interested because they are 150 calories. They have 29 grams of protein and they have zero sugar. So my feedback on them and they're also like the packaging is really nice and it's the RX guys, like new thing or whatever. Mm hmm. They're not good. And what it made me realize is I'm just not, I know I need more protein. I'm over 40. I need to eat more fiber and protein. I'm going to die if I don't and I need to wait, live eight days a week. But the main thing is that they're not good and I'm not going to. I just, I was like, you know what? I don't need this extra, this extra stuff because I don't move enough to burn the energy. So it's fine. But anyway, I want you to get into this and put the Amanda Malspin on it. CPG reporters be damned. No, I'm sure that you could collab. The sort of like extra, extra protein stuff is really hard for me because I hate like the taste and texture of like protein additives, which is why I like the core power ones, I think, because it's just dairy and like I do quite well with dairy. I know some people don't tolerate it, but I, my body loves dairy. And so they taste like quite good relative to like the average protein shake out there. But bars I have a hard time with, it's like a textural thing. Yeah. Anyway, there's a lot of white space, a lot of white space. So we're here today to talk about print magazines and a recent piece you did for Blumber Business Week, but I also wanted to have you on. And I can't believe I realized when I texted you, we had talked about it months ago and I just said, never followed up. But so I'm sure you'll be back many times. But we've known each other probably 10 years at least. And you have a really interesting background, how you ended up working in business journalism. And you are a fashion person. And, and one of the like core kinds of fashion people, which is that you know a lot about retail and you know a lot about how things are priced and especially the last few years with the pricing mores and everything. I wanted to discuss with you your background and how you got into journalism and, and your first like big job, which is how we met when you were the, I believe you started as the managing editor of Purse Forum. So maybe you can kind of talk about what that means and what that was and, and how you dropped into that world. Yeah. I, you know, I grew up being sort of like babysat by the magazine aisle at the grocery store, like a lot of people in our age range who ended up in journalism, I think. Yeah. And so I went off to college. I grew up in Atlanta or in like Metro Atlanta. And so it was free for me to go to University of Georgia. They happened to have like a very good, like large journalism school. So it was sort of like, Oh, well, I'll go here for free and I'll get a journalism degree and I'll be a writer. And then I, you know, I was, my senior year was 2008. So it was sort of quickly like, Oh, I guess I won't be a writer. Never mind. I was four years younger than you. So I was still like, it's going to be fine. 2004, I was like, it's still great. You, you got there when like the advertising really started to drop out exactly like the date that it happened. Yeah. Like the great magazine die off like happened while I was in my senior year of college. And like, I hadn't, you know, I, I don't come from like a, the types of families that normally put people into like major media in New York. Like I come from like a very normal, you know, Georgian background. And so I hadn't done like a lot of internships or whatever. Like I had a job in college, like locally I worked at Best Buy. So I had not, it just seemed all together. What a training field that was to cover retail and consumer behavior. Yeah. No, I, I am glad for my retail experience every day in this job. But like, I'm a practical girl, I think first and foremost. And I was like, I'm probably not going to be like a, you know, work for a magazine in New York. So I didn't really like even pursue it that much in school. But then I got to the end of school and I took a class on criticism with a professor I really liked. And I was like, well, maybe I should see if I can like do this online a little bit because like blogs were starting to pop up like Jezebel and Gawker were starting to come around. And I was like, well, I like, I like fashion. I like handbags. Maybe I could do something about that while I have like a real job, you know, in marketing or something. I, my first job out of college was in marketing. And I was already like a regular at Perseforum and I knew Megan and Vladimir, the people who own and still run it. And they, the website was sort of in its impancy and but growing and neither of them were writers and they didn't want to be responsible for like all of the content. So they paid me to write blog posts and we didn't have enough work for me at my marketing job. So I did some of them like while I was on the clock there just to keep myself entertained. And they eventually brought me on full time, which was great because before I had the opportunity to put my two weeks in, I got laid off at the marketing job because the economy collapsed in early 2009. I remember that. Yeah, not not not ideal. But it was like I was planning to quit and I didn't even get a chance to quit before I lost the job. So I was like, well, I guess I better do this full time. And, you know, a few years later, I the website was doing well. It was growing. I was getting paid a little bit more. I moved to New York when they moved to New York to sort of like grow the business there. And I worked for them for 10 years. Eventually, you know, I started managing the website overall and managing other freelancers and just writing about the luxury handbag market like every day, multiple times a day. Can you explain what it was? Like what a forum is? I mean, most of the people who listen to this were probably on at least a fashion spot, but like let's act like they weren't. And then also what like what were you all tracking? Yeah, the forum was the thing that I found first, although it was the thing that they that they developed second after Perceblog. But it was a time. Yeah, but I forgot that it was called Perceblog. Oh, yeah. Because I always think of the forum. Right. The forum is such a piece of fashion history, I think, especially, you know, for accessories. So I was like hanging out around there and they were trying to like sort of build that up because this was pre like the proliferation of social media like Facebook existed in my space existed. But like there weren't really these like sort of overarching social networks to where people talked about like everything. So there was a lot of like little fiefdoms where people talked about their special interests. And I had been on like various versions of this, like since I could like sit in a chair and type. Like I have the unquenchable desire to write about what I think on the internet. I have had that since before I really understood it. And so this was one that I had found because I, you know, my job at Best Buy in college, I had saved up like a little bit of money and I wanted to buy a coach bag. And I wanted to find out if I could get that on sale. And Googling brought me to people talking about this particular coach bag on Perceforum. So the blog was, it is just sort of like a daily digest of like trend stories and photos of new collections and reviews and like some like business stories. I wrote some business stories at the time. And then the forum was just like a big sort of free for all for people to talk about their favorite brands. There's like sub forums for basically every major brand. And when I left the company in 2018, I think there were almost 400,000 members of it. So it was in terms of like a hyper niche, niche special interests like luxury handbags. It was like quite large. And we sort of, you sort of found every way possible to cover luxury handbags because we had to post multiple times every day. So you really think about all the different ways that something might be interesting. You know, the thing that the reason I don't know if this is how we met, we probably met at an event. But the reason I like started calling you as a source for stories and stuff was because I was writing a lot about pricing, which now is like even more of an issue. But I remember one of my big first like the first six months I was writing for business of fashion, I wrote a piece about pricing inflation. And I'm sure I called you for many stories. It was just you were tracking like every single price hike. And this was long before now everyone knows that these brands do this, but it was before it was really a known thing. And you'd be like, or I remember I was doing a story a couple of years ago about looking at like the Celine, is it like the Triumph bag? Was that what it was called? A luggage tote probably. Luggage tote. Yeah, I guess it was the luggage tote or the Phantom. Yeah, they had the the luggage tote, the Phantom luggage tote. They had a bag called the trio that was like three little pouches. Oh, yeah, I still have that. It's really good that I think it was the Phantom. When that bag launched, I believe it was $995. Now it's $4,000. Right. Something crazy like that. And I remember like using PurseForum as a resource to be able to fact check stuff like to get it and then be able to fact it was heartbeat. And also the brands don't want to tell you what the right former price was. I used to call the stores and be like, how much did that used to cost or how much is it going to cost in the next thing? And did you do a lot of like calling retailers or going in to check pricing? Like, how did you all find out the pricing stuff? Part of it was going into check pricing because some of that stuff, like they won't really tell you on the phone. And especially in, you know, the Internet of 10 years ago, so many fewer brands had listings for their bags online. Like if they wholesaled a lot to the big department stores, they were going to be listed online probably. But like Chanel didn't list prices online. You know, Celine for a long time did not list prices online. Armez is still sort of a mystery in a lot of ways because their pricing varies so much based on leather. Oh, interesting. Can you talk about that a little bit? Like what do you mean by that? So there if it's calf leather versus pebbled or what have you, or is it like the specific origins of the leather that changes the price? They have a bunch of different leather finishes. Like even before you start to get into exotics, they have like different grains and different finishes. And those a lot of times will be priced differently depending on the type of finish. There's like, I think there's like some price cluster tiers. But but yeah, you can you can pay more or less for a leather Armez bag, depending on like what kind of leather it is before you even get to exotics and special things. Yeah. And like a lot of it was crowd crowdsourced. We would ask people who we knew were subject matter experts like on a brand who were on our forum. And that was a big way that we got international pricing too. Because like we couldn't be everywhere and like they wouldn't tell us if we called. But but somebody who was just a really rich lady who was obsessed with this would absolutely figure out from her sales associate what all this stuff was was going to cost. Because they loved having an assignment. They loved participating and gathering Intel. So it was a lot of it was it was very shoe leather or crowdsourced because like this information is just really, really well guarded, even to a certain extent today. Like they don't nobody wants you to know exactly how much anything costs until you're ready to buy it. Yeah. And pricing like pricing is one of my favorite topics. I'm working on like several pricing stories right now, including one about like the Capri tapestry merger that will come out tomorrow. I believe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So when you were first covering it, this was common that the price prices would increase. And I remember that piece I did in this was 2013 about fashion inflation. It was basically the big thing was like Manolo Blanix were $400 for ever. And then suddenly they were 800. And I had like a few and Chanel had already started to increase. I think about I have a flat bag that I think I paid $2,500 for in 2010. Now that would be $8,000. Like there's been a and in the last four or five years, everyone. So for a while was really about Hermes would increase their prices, but they are very particular about the way they do it. And then there was also it was Hermes and then there was Chanel started to really ramp up and they all were incrementally. But the last like three years, I would say it's been really crazy. And there are many reasons for that. It's that the market could take it. It's that they needed to make a bigger profit and they couldn't sell as many bags because the market was changing. It's that more of the consumer was coming from the really, really high end or really, really low end. The middle was getting squeezed out. But from your perspective, like what's the most surprising thing about what's happening with pricing and luxury in particular? First, like it's fantastic that we're talking about this because like the the article that's coming out by the time this podcast comes out is like about like a fair bit of this. Everyone needs to read this. And I want to know what you think about the tapestry. Yeah, everything generally. But yeah, it's sort of interesting because the argument that I make in the piece is that is that luxury pricing like sort of doesn't follow. I mean, luxury luxury handbags are Veblen goods. Like their their pricing logic doesn't follow the sort of like commodity pricing logic. Which was an issue with that ruling. Right. They didn't they don't get that even though I think whatever. But yeah, anyway. Yeah. Yeah. No, that that is like precisely the argument in this piece is that like what coach and Kate Spade sell isn't luxury handbags. What they sell are handbags priced at two hundred to six hundred dollars. So like them combining into like a larger company with Michael Kors like wouldn't necessarily change that. Yeah. Because like what they sell is a is a is a product that has like a particular customer at a particular price tier. Like the coach price increases haven't even kept up with inflation since twenty seventeen. Like they like what they are selling is fundamentally different than what the high end of the market is selling even though they're all in the same industry. But at the top end of the market, I think that like you end up with these sort of like de facto pricing tiers in the handbag market where like you are not necessarily. Where like what happens is your prices of your brand are sort of capped by whatever the prices are of the brand that brands that are above you and perceived as better than yours. So like at the high end that means there's like thousands of dollars of leeway like but or mess basically caps all of it. Like it would be hard for anybody to move up market past or mess because they are the gold standard. And in order to move up market past them in like a meaningful way, you would have to convince the or mess consumer that actually your brand is the gold standard. And I think that would be like well not impossible unless something serious changes about or mess. So like Chanel can increase prices until they get to or mess and then they can't probably can't do that anymore. And like Louis Vuitton can increase prices until they get to Chanel for their leather and then they probably can't do that anymore. Like you are sort of capped by where you are in the hierarchy. And so it sort of all depends on where the top of the market is moving. And because or mess can sort of charge whatever it wants because or mess still sells like well below the market value of those bags, which I think people outside of the industry don't understand. Like if you can buy a thirteen thousand dollar Birken at an or mess boutique and turn around and sell it for twenty thousand dollars, like the real like the market value of that bag is twenty thousand dollars. And or mess is just deciding not to price its bags like that. Yeah. And so that sort of like prevents other brands from moving up past that point. But what or mess also does, I think, is sort of proved the brands directly below it, that there is like so much pent up demand for luxury goods, like things that feel genuinely special or things that feel genuinely luxurious at that price tier that like, oh, you can probably jack your prices up a lot. If you have like a relatively good reputation that's like not quite or mess, because there is just so much like existing demand at that price tier, like or mess can't meet at all. These people have a lot of money. So there's there's just like there's a lot of very, very wealthy people who entertain themselves by buying at this price tier. So if you can convince someone to to look at your brand with like a significant upside relative to what's below it, you can probably move up until you get to whatever is.

One is, do you think certain brands have tried to push too high and they think they're that tier below airmen's and they're actually not? And we don't have to call any other brands out right now because I think it's actually just like personal opinion. You could see it in the sales data too. But do you think that some of them have tried to push too far? Yeah, absolutely. I think that like the sort of bonanza of 2020 and on in luxury goods got some people a little bit out over their skis. And then once like interest rates went up and things sort of normalized a little bit, some brands found themselves at a price tier that like put themselves a little bit outside of where their market really was. And I don't know exactly how those brands are going to correct because like the last thing that any of these brands want to do is like imply that they had been overpriced because that like it's harmful to the illusion that you're trying to create for your brand. But I do think that there is like you can see in some of the some of the sales results that there is a little bit of a malaise for these like ultra, ultra expensive things, not from every brand. Ormez has a great quarterly. Yeah. But but from some of these brands that misunderstood their market value relative to like the real leaders in the space. Yeah. And it's interesting because because like, like you said, Hermes could charge way more than they do and they don't they choose not to. So they're losing pro they're losing out on profits. Because for the long term goal of like keeping the brand feeling correct or would have you. The other thing I'm curious because you know a lot of these collectors, you know a lot of these very wealthy people who do this as a sport, they shop as a sport, they buy a new bag every single week they have. I was with someone and I think I've mentioned this on the podcast like 75 times, but I was with an investor in Paris and they said to me. The luxury industry has really like come into its own the last 20 years when it consolidated. That's when it became normal quote unquote for people to buy this kind of stuff like normal for normal people to want to buy a Louis Vuitton bag or whatever. Like you were trying to buy a coach bag in 2008. Probably now you would be trying to buy a boutique bag or something, you know, something because like our perception of that stuff has changed as a culture. This person was like, you know what? All these rich people have enough bags. They have enough bags, they have enough stuff in their closet. They there isn't anything interesting about it anymore. Like it has gotten to the point like talking about fatigue. It's more it's like even deeper than that where it feels like there just isn't a there isn't really like an excitement or a delight in buying this stuff as much anymore. Do you believe that? Or do you think that's a set of one of these circumstances where we always think it's like worse than it used to be or whatever? Do you think the consumer is changing? Or do you think that we are just going through like a weird time and that five years from now, everybody's going to be buying a bunch of crop again? I think there's something to that because for a while, the fashion industry is like real engine of growth has been markets where people are becoming wealthy for the first time. Yeah. And to have, you know, culturally, institutionally, socially have a lot less experience with like all of these consumer options and consumer goods and experiences that they can have. And that is really where the growth has been like the mature markets are mature. Like you get people who are like, OK, I do have like sort of like not enough bags because if you're like that wealthy, you'll never have enough bags. But like people are starting to get a little tapped out. I think maybe not like the wealthiest, wealthiest like top tier because like the cost to buy another or mess bag like it's nothing to them. It's a rounding error. It's pocket change. But like people who are maybe going to buy one bag a year or one bag every couple of years. Like that is like a market where because prices have risen so much in the top half of the market and because these goods are like so omnipresent now, I do think we're getting to the point where like we may have like things may have fallen a little bit out of balance. Like the something that I have said in pieces before is that like the great paradox of the luxury industry and luxury handbags, whatever, is that you have to sell a ton of the same thing while. Ensuring that everybody believes what they're buying is rare. And like that is just like a really difficult paradox to hold over time. And the more you try to grow in like existing markets, the more that illusion sort of starts to fall apart. And and I do think that like the the sort of like incredible growth of luxury and especially of top tier luxury makes it a little bit hard to to maintain that. And as we get to more international and developing markets that are like a little bit more mature and a little bit more tapped out, I think that like. It would behoove the fashion industry to move in a more creative and interesting direction with some of their stuff because I don't think you can just do what they've been doing forever. It's interesting. It's all about like an industry consolidation story. I want to get into it's funny because the real reason we're here to talk today is about print magazines and sort of like print reaching a bottom and then sort of rising up. And as the as the luxury industry shot up, the magazine industry shot down. So it's an interesting parallel because they're so interconnected. Before we do though, so you wrote this for Bloomberg Business Week where your staff reporter talk about how you went from Perseforum to you to you were at the Atlantic and then you you've been at Bloomberg now for a while. You know, I know you. I know you're a great reporter. I know what went into that, but we have similar backgrounds in that we were not. I ended up starting in a business magazine, but still like you and I both like got in when we we didn't have the sort of pedigree to get in places. How did you break into the Atlantic and like you became a star instantly and I still can't believe they let you go. But congrats to Bloomberg. You're you are you're one of a kind. But how did you end up getting a job at the Atlantic and were you covering health there at first and then you you ended up cut something like that. Tell me tell me the story because I think it's it's really inspiring, especially for people who want to get into journalism or don't understand how like normal people can be journalists. Yeah, the Atlantic sort of came out of the blue. I had been working at Purse blog for 10 years at that point. And the last few years I had done some freelancing outside of outside of Purse blog and like all credit to them. I still really appreciate my my bosses at the time the owners of the site for like letting me explore other things because that you know none of this would have happened without like their blessing in that way. And so I had other stuff I wanted to write about because of my, you know, as I said, my insatiable desire to post and and so I had done some freelance pieces for like a bunch of different like magazines, websites, whatever, and a couple of them had gone like somewhat viral had been like well received. So out of the out of the blue, my editor at the Atlantic Paul Beseglio just cold emailed me and he was like hey I'm the health editor at the Atlantic. I have a spot open on my team. What would you think about applying for that job? I'm interested in covering health as a expansive idea. I know that that's not your background and I was like, you know, I'll take the call. I didn't think they were going to hire me. Yeah, I didn't think they were going to hire me because like, you know, everybody I worked with there had an Ivy League degree and I went to a state school and came from a handbag website, but they saw the potential and hired me and I was doing some like more health focused health stuff for a while. I was on the health desk the entire time I was there the full six years. Wow. Yeah. They didn't have a business desk. They didn't have a business desk. So it was sort of in like my writing relationship with my editor was good. So they just let us cook, which was smart on their part. Sometimes, you know, sometimes manage less instead of manage more and you'll get the product you want. So they just let me cook with Paul for six years and I ended up sort of they knew that my background and interest was in fashion and in consumer things. And they were interested in having stories about that if I thought they were interesting. Like what was really wonderful about that job is that like if I thought something was interesting, they trusted me to write about it. And so I eventually got a column with them called material world, which was about consumer culture. And I did that imprint for two years and then on the web after that for several years until Bloomberg reached out earlier this year, this spring and asked if I was interested in talk to them and it seems like a really interesting opportunity because like how my beat had evolved over time was to more of a businessy type of reporting. And it just seemed like an interesting way to dig more deeply into some of the very sort of technical aspects of the consumer market and of consumers and the system.

So tell me what your kind of big picture missive at Bloomberg Business Week is and what this piece in particular about the sort of refreshing or the re-invigoration of print. And I have an analogy which I'm curious if you agree, but how that fits into the kind of work you're doing there. Yeah, I work under Business Week. I have a column there about consumer culture called buying power. And so I write columns and longer reported features. And the print story came about because I had seen like a couple things here and there about more publications bringing back print or expanding print. I knew from my time at The Atlantic that like print was actually very important to our strategy. Like it was something that readers really liked. It was something that people proactively opted into. And so when The Atlantic announced that they were expanding from 10 issues a year to 12, like that was like, you know, when you're writing a trend story, you look for some things that eventually start happening in quick succession to be like, all right, this is the time to try to explicate like what is going on here. And that happened. The Field Magazine, which had like a bunch of really great writers in it, was released. And there was some press around that. And just like several things had all sort of happened together. And it seems like the New York Mag media power brokers package came out. And the conversation around print seemed to be like picking back up, but I felt like people weren't like totally understanding what print can do as a sales feature, really. So it's like as a marketing vessel, like the people who have been in media for a long time and run media companies, I think think of it as sort of a boondoggle or a waste of resources or something that might not necessarily be easy to turn cash flow positive like in and of itself, which I think is all fair. But like, I thought it was being underrated as like a way to provide like readers of a certain type with a product they enjoyed and like the media business has like a terrible time figuring out how to sell people something they actually want, I think, and something that they that they have a good time with. And like magazines didn't start. Yeah. Magazines didn't start to die off because people stopped liking magazines magazines started to die off because the old business model stopped working. So if you can like figure out how to recapitulate your print edition as a way to interact with readers and on a more personal enjoyable level, then like it might very well be like a really great business decision to do that. And also like advertisers tend, especially high end advertisers and if you have that readership, then that's useful. They tend to really like print because their ads are not sort of just, you know, on your screen, perhaps breaking your browser's ability to let you read the article you're trying to click on, they are not like they're rendered cohesively in predictable colors and saturation and size and, you know, all of these things that like, if you're advertising luxury goods or high end cars or something like that, like really matter to you and really make a difference in how like a consumer perceives and add or perceives a product. Yeah. Do you see it as someone who, and I was the same way we were sort of living and working outside of the legacy publishers. I see it as they didn't want to change the way they operated. And therefore, the kind of talent who was attracted to it diminished, because it wasn't operated in a modern way. And they couldn't pay people as much as they used to, and they were spending on certain things, but not on other things. And so it all just sort of collapsed where you can still do something that, you know, you spend money on certain things, but not on others. And it's never going to be a big business, but it can be a profitable business of your scrappy and inventive. I think it is really still hard to make it profitable, even at these indie magazines that somehow keep trucking along, because I just think the like mix of people you need to make something like that work is very challenging to find. But do you think that like sometimes I think of it as sort of like the record industry. So like records, I don't know what I'm sure they the decline is started in with tapes in the 80s. But like, there is a moment probably 10 years ago or something where the record industry started to build up again. And it's a really small cottage industry. But like it is a business that is, I don't know if it's still growing, but it was growing for a long time. I bet it still is because it became an enthusiast sport. Do you think that print magazines, especially the enthusiast ones like the niche fashion magazines and the like niche topic magazines could be sort of if the publishing or media industry wanted to look at them like the value that records play in the music industry. Yeah, I think that for a long time, the the sort of like declining legacy magazines were just like horrifically mismanaged. Yeah. And like people who were running those businesses were not quick enough to like understand like the changing value of having a print magazine or like how you would need to like scale it differently. Like I think maybe you have four issues a year instead of 12 maybe you have six issues year something like that. And and then you use it as a marketing opportunity to make every launch really special and and you know, use it to to insert yourself into conversation. Whereas if you were just publishing a website every day, it would not be as easy to do that. And I think that the magazine has to be good. And yeah, and I think that that is something that a lot of a lot of like legacy media companies forgot about as well. You can't fill it with blog content like it has to be it has to be good. And it has to be like you have to know who you're trying to reach with it, which is why I think vinyl is probably a fairly good comparison also like the publishing industry in general I think is a good comparison because you know ebooks were supposed to kill bookstores and they were supposed to kill the physical publishing industry but they didn't because like there is like a very enthusiastic tier of consumer who buys an overwhelming or like a disproportionate amount of books. And those people a lot of them really like physical books so if you can like hone in on who your actual customer is and like what they like and what you're trying to reach them with, you can recapitulate a business that is not like as broad and ubiquitous as it once was like print magazines but you can do it in like a that way with like a more fine tuned understanding of like who you're trying to talk to and what they need to hear from you and what the value is of the product that you're putting out. And like I think that that can still be a good although like smaller business for a lot of publications especially if they think of them as is like their print magazine more is like part of an events business maybe even rather than part of a straightforward editorial product. And we should copy it's still hard to make money off of any of this stuff. But the one thing yeah I totally agree on the way I see it is it's interesting because this first top of this conversation was about pricing with luxury goods and then the bottom of it is about these magazines and as the luxury industry is consolidating and became more of a direct business like a lot of them 80 or 90% of their businesses direct they market directly online they go through Instagram they don't need the magazines. They started to pull their budgets away. The magazines got afraid they began began to pander to the advertisers in the copy and therefore the copy and the in the articles became less exciting. And therefore the people who worked at these places were like well I might as well just be an influencer and work with these brands directly. And it's like as one industry exploded it sort of killed the other industry and obviously like there are other factors in the the ability to become direct to consumer through social media and stuff. But it's an interesting like you think fashions blowing up fashion magazines would blow up but it was the quite the opposite and I do think it's exactly what it comes what you said like it needs to be good. And I guess the last question for you is when you think about how you approach these pieces so you're writing about these magazines that like most people who have read who are reading your publication have never heard of and they will never open. How do you because you're really good at this can you give like one insight into how do you take a topic like indie magazines or just print enthusiasm and enthusiasm and we should shout out Maddie Khan who could not be with us today and I really actually want to have you both on but she wasn't able to do it. Because she just did a piece on Costco from the New York Times about how successful they're like top tier magazine is and that's easy because like you write about Costco magazine everybody knows about Costco that reaches anyone. But when you were writing out like field and these other these other niche interview whatever like how do you impart your deep insider knowledge to a group of people who doesn't really maybe want to know like what's your secret to that because I think you're very good at. I think you put it out in a way that like I enjoyed that article but I know people who know nothing about the topic would first of all thank you and also shout out to Maddie I really loved that Costco piece. Love you Maddie. Yes, I was very jealous of it I was like this really good. I'm so happy for her. Yeah, three years. I know I know yes to do it. Yeah, and they should have said yes to her far sooner but she she paid it off in the end. The entire pursuit. But yeah, I think that like, honestly, this is something that I learned to do over time at purse blog because I did spend 10 years writing multiple times a day about handbags and like you get really good over time at being like okay, what is interesting here how do I frame this in a way that like people will click on this and read about it how do I sell this idea that I have about this thing to people and like some with some topics it's harder than others. But if you, I try to like ground all of my work in figuring out how like, if I weren't a journalist and I were just me. And I was interacting with all of these things in my everyday life like all these phenomena that like, I might notice but not have like language to put around or might not have an idea that like was like anything more than a weird thing that I noticed like how would I need that to be framed in order for me to feel like I had gained something by clicking on a link about it. So like, people don't necessarily know in large numbers about apartment or better Southern or like these all these niche indie magazines. But if you can like situate like the existence of those magazines within like layers of like sort of larger ideas, you can like walk people into why they should be interested in it because it was the niche indie magazines and then also like a couple of magazines that that everybody has heard of that have like changed their print strategy a little bit. And then sort of like couching that all in the idea of like the media industry fundamentally has changed in the last 15 years and it's changed in the way that like all of us notice we all notice like the the outgrowth of that that like the type of things that we read online are different than the types of things we read in print publications, you know, 15 or 20 years ago like there are there are dynamics at work here that everybody has experienced and might be curious about so if you can sort of like build the idea out by a couple of layers you can I think bring a lot of people into being interested in rather small phenomena that are that they leave feeling like they understand things a little bit better.
