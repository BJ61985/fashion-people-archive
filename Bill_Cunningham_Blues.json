And today with me on the show is director, writer, and CEO, Mark Bozek. We're talking Bill Cunningham, Willie Smith, the Battle of Versailles, QVC, and what these things all have in common. Guess what? It's Mark. Let's get started. Hi, everyone. Hope you are having a great week. It is Friday. If you're listening to this the day it is published, the news never stops. The sun goes on rising and setting. The fashion industry is in a state of panic. At the same time, it's totally fine. I've done my due diligence and made the requisite calls regarding the results of the US presidential election. And it seems that generally, I'd say that execs in Europe are treating this the way execs in the US would treat an election in Europe. And that's to say the economy is pretty good right now. As long as Trump doesn't institute this handbag tariff, it will be fine. And spending will pick up in 2025 as planned or as projected by analysts like Lukasoka. In the US, I think people are a little more concerned about the cost of consumer goods increasing further and the threat of those tariffs that keep coming up, not just on champagne and other fun things, but also on handbags potentially. Now you can understand why the R&Ds are closing up to Trump. They don't want him to put in this handbag tariff. The one thing is that the tariff that was potentially going to be instituted the last time around was on French handbags. So there are ways to get around this stuff, but anyway, it would be a pain in the butt. My understanding is that Trump's goal is to sort of force manufacturing back to the US, which is why he's so into all these tariffs. Many people who voted for him think that's a great idea because they want real jobs, et cetera, et cetera. I am a little bit reluctant to recommend that you read a David Brooks piece, but I did think his recent opinion column in the New York Times sort of explained the manufacturing element and the sort of working class element of why people voted for Trump. I thought he did a good job. I hope that I don't get fired for saying that. The problem with this idea of forcing manufacturing back to the US is that especially in high fashion, the machines required to get the stuff done are just they're actually not available in the US. They're giant and no one's buying them because they cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. In some cases, it's just not happening. In that way, finishes and stuff that happens in Italy, most of it just can never happen here. That being said, I do believe in localized manufacturing becoming a bigger deal and I have for years. It's the reason why Louis Vuitton has opened factories here. It's the reason why Hermes has manufacturing capabilities here. They don't have their own factory, but you can do some work with Hermes here in the US and in California in particular where I live, there's a lot of the stuff that's done. I think that real localization is going to be automated manufacturing. It's on the lower end of fashion. It does make sense for it to be local speed to market. A lot of that's going to become automated. It's not going to really create that many more jobs. Also, it's going to take forever because of the way these industries work anyway. This week on Line Sheet, we have Goop News, Alta Wazoo, layoffs, revenue numbers, valuations, everything you need to know about Goop. It's one of Rachel's obsessions. It's also one of mine and we love chatting about it together. I also have a ton of Intel out of Europe on Thursday News Broke in Europe that LVMH fired its long time head of HR Chantel. I have a little bit more background on why that happened and I'll have more on that next week, I'm sure. It's a huge deal and I think there are people within the halls of LVMH that are rejoicing, but also it's not a great look for it to happen the way it did. Once again, they didn't get ahead of the news. They didn't communicate it publicly. They should have gotten ahead of it and then people wouldn't be digging so much. They don't pay me to tell them what to do. I just write about it. I'll have more on that. I also have info on the Chanel Creative Director job, how much they're paying people, but you got to go to Line Sheet to check that out. I hope you enjoyed this interview with Mark. I met him, I think about a year ago and he's just a jack of all trades. He's done pretty much everything. He was the CEO of HSN, but he worked at QBC for Barry Diller. He directed documentary about Bill Cunningham. He used to work with Willie Smith, one of my all-time favorite designers and one of the unsung designers of American fashion. He worked for him in the 80s. He just wrote a book about the Battle of Versailles. He's just everywhere. It was a really fun conversation. The goal with these Friday talks is, yes, it's fun to talk to super famous people, but also just people who have really been in the industry forever. I really enjoyed this one, so I hope you do too. Mark Bozak, welcome to fashion, people. Thank you very much, Lauren. Great to be here. I'm so happy to chat with you. We have so much to discuss. First up, what did you have for breakfast? I had pop tarts this morning at about four o'clock. Wow, four in the morning. Four in the morning, which is kind of my usual time of getting up these days. And the pop tart, I have a French, one of my best friends is a French guy who always makes fun of American food, so he's always bringing pop tarts over. And so I figured I got to eat them before my son does. So you don't, this isn't like a regular thing that you would be eating pop tarts. Do you eat first thing in the morning or do you wait a little bit? I eat pretty much an hour or so into the day, depending on what's going on. But yeah, breakfast is an important meal. And what flavor pop tarts were they? Oh, very. Sounds good. You put like a GABA butter on them. If you're going to really go in, you got to go in all the way. That's a good idea. So it makes them feel a little richer and less pure sugar. Correct. That's a great idea. That's a great idea. I need to, I need to get back on the pop tart train. There are lots of good memories. Indeed, indeed. So let's just start. Who are you? Depends on what time of the day that you sort of ask, but it's, it's interesting that it's a relevant question apropos to three weeks ago when I was in Paris. And I have a really good friend named Susan Rockefeller, who's married to David Rockefeller. And she's been a friend and a fan for the last four years when I, or six years when I made the book Huntingham documentary. She kept saying, Mark, she keeps saying, Mark, you got to get rid of this CEO business and stop telling everybody that Bradley Cooper played you in the movie Joy and blah, blah, blah, blah. And I was like, yeah, but, you know, she was, you're an artist. And yeah, that's where you have to lay claim to that, to being an artist. I said, yeah, but I have to also lay claim to eating, taking the rent and taking care of my family. But given what's happened over the last six to three days on launching the book, and so many other things that have come from that launching of the book, I was in a cab in Paris watching my book. And an Uber driver, the cab driver asked me, you know, I'm sure what do you do? And I said, I'm an artist. And it's the first time I've ever said it out loud. And boy, it feels really good. It just feels really good. And so that's kind of it is, you know, when I, I often say my previous life or in my previous lives, this is what I used to do. And I guess if we go going back, you know, reasonably far enough, I got to New York when I was out of high school. Actually, I went to LA. I got to go into Renny's of Beverly Hills thinking I'd be like a butler to the stars out of high school in St. Louis. And I lied and I said I was 23. And I had been to Webster College in St. Louis, this little community college. And I majored in business. Of course, I'd never even been to the school, but they couldn't Google or, you know, whatever they would do, you know, whatever they do now, which you can find out about everything. And I got a call from Lee Strasburg, they're from his wife. And Lee was 75, his kids were seven and nine and his, she was in her late 30s. They wanted a housekeeper and also an assistant to Lee. And I said, well, I don't really don't think I can do the housekeeping thing, although I could. But the personal assistant thing sounded great. So I met him in LA and I gave a good active performance. I put on glasses that had no prescriptions in them so I could look older. And he hired me. So I spent the next three years, six months in LA, six months in New York. My God, what was that like? It was amazing. I mean, I worked my ass off and 24 hours, seven days a week, but I lived with him and his family on Central Park West next to the Dakota and in this amazing house in Brentwood. And I come from meat and potatoes, you know, Polish family in Detroit. And suddenly I'm with this insane family that has these arguments and screaming and fighting and then they're talking and loving each other the next minute, which is not how I grew up. You had a fight, it was a couple of weeks before anybody talked again, particularly my parents. But Lee remains the grand master of all masters of other great teachers. And so every morning, Sunday morning, he would dictate to me his book on the method called Dream of Passion. He hated doing it. I was petrified because he was so, you know, white hair and glasses. But I did. I created my own shorthand of about 80 different things he would say most often, like into an actor and Stanislavski. And then he'd have these salons in the afternoon every Sunday. And at these salons were Al Pacino, Shelley Winters, Robert De Niro. When Robert De Niro was getting fat for Raging Bull, they'd come over every Sunday and, you know, all this, you know, I had to go get white sable for Al Pacino because he loved white sable, that white fish from Barney Greengrass. And that, you know, I did that. Now Al was like his son, a surrogate, and I saw him, you know, every Sunday for almost three years. And so for me, I knew, I knew enough. I was certainly naive at that age, but I knew enough to say this is pretty cool. And to be able to meet all of these people and in LA to drive with him to Barbara Streisand's house, houses in Malibu was amazing. You know, and I have these weird memories of recall of being in one of her houses, which was designed, this modern house that was designed based on now cigarettes, the colors of now cigarettes, which was a maroon, a silver and sometimes a mother color. And it was William's and Sidney Pollock. And so, you know, I got exposed and got the bug clearly at a really early age. And so it was great. So how did you transition out of that? Because that seems like the kind of thing that would be you could have done for 25 years until I could have. Yes. But when you're when you're that intensely involved in a family, as well as his business of teaching, it starts to get tired, right? And it starts and you also start to get ambitious about wanting to do something else instead of just being an assistant. And and so I just said, you know, it's time for me to go. And I really had no idea what I was going to do. But I just had to go because the pressure was getting, you know, intense and you're part of the family and then you're not part of the family. And that clashes a bit over over time. So what did you do from then? So I quit. I completely I moved into an apartment on Seventy-third and Broadway that I couldn't afford. I had met this woman who ran a company called I Am International is another company called here and there. They forecasted fashion trends. Right. And she was studying at least Rossburg. And I started taking acting classes just because and we happened to do a scene from the graduate. And we did this scene from the graduate and lived the part and all that jazz. And she said and I said, I called her up one day and said, look, I, you know, can I work at your company? And so I literally walked from Seventy-third to 39th and Broadway because I had no money for a subway. I started at the company as an assistant to everybody. She gave me like a hundred bucks. And I got started and then I figured out how to make it work. I became their marketing director at a pretty young age. And they were selling like it was a $2,000 a year subscription for color trends and slideshows from Europe and things like that. That was kind of the fore foreseer of a bunch of other companies that do that really well. $2,000. That feels like a lot of money for them. But now that that kind of thing, I don't know how much those businesses, I guess WGSN still is around very much, but they probably charge like 25 up to a hundred grand a year for that stuff at this point. And now you have, you know, Tag Walk, which is just, you know, probably as good as anything out there that does it in five seconds. So those are kind of finished. Wow. So that's when you really became a fashion person. Yes. I suppose that's when I became a fashion person. And then I was trying to sell Willie Smith, Willie Weir's partner, Willie Smith's partner at Willie Weir, which had been around for a couple of years. I was trying to sell her a subscription. And she was totally not interested at all. She kept looking at me and, you know, she's great, great, still a great friend, French lady. And she called me up a couple of days later and said, you know, we don't want your service, but do you want to work for us? Do you know Grace Mirabella and Polly Melon and all those people? I had no idea who I knew these people. So I went to a newsstand, which you could do in those days and got all these magazine masks. And I memorized, you know, my God, the legions of names Andre Lantali. And I told her I knew all of them. And I got in and it was, you know, another sort of great stepping stone to work for Willie, whose company was on fire at the time. And and have just an absolute blast for the next six years. So tell me about Willie, because you and I have discussed this, there was an incredible, incredible, and I think I've talked about it on the podcast or written about it, exhibit at the Cooper Hewitt, I think, 2021 or 2022, on his work that was marvelous. One of the best fashion exhibits I've ever seen. And then afterwards I was like, oh, I really want to get something. And I looked online on like eBay and Etsy and things. You really can't find any of their original fashion. You can find the stuff that eventually became a license that you could get really a TJ Maxson Marshalls quite a bit. But tell me about who he was and what his impact was on American fashion, because I think it was so much bigger than anyone really realizes. Much, much more so. And I started five years ago, an Instagram page called Remember Willie Smith. And it just began small and still relatively small. But got you look back 35 years ago to those times, which many, many people are looking back these days to be informed, go forward. I mean, Willie was known as Willie from Philly, Willie from Philadelphia. And he was really after Stephen Burroughs, who was one of the first real black designers, ironically, who went to Versailles. Willie was the man. And he was the only difference was that his clothes, all of which were made in India and Bernadine Morris, famous long time ago, fashion editor of the New York Times were the first one when he won the Cody, is now the CFDA award, called it Street Couture. He was the first designer, likely because he was black, but also likely because his clothes were so accessible. Like he's always Willie always used to say, I don't make clothes for the queen and royalty. I make people who wave at the queen as she's as she's going by. And I just, we dove in and we did incredibly great things. We had, and Lori especially was so supportive of doing twisted kind of things that weren't normal. She was the business partner. Yeah. And creative partner as well. I mean, when Christo wrapped the Pond of Bridge in Paris, we made all the smocks for Christo. Oh my God. 1500 that they wore during that whole two week process. And we gave a big party for him the night it was finished on the sand and everybody in Paris was there. We did a movie in Africa, which we're going to see pretty soon. We went to Senegal West Africa instead of doing a fashion show. I convinced them to fund a hundred and fifty thousand dollar movie called The Expedition. And we went to Dakar Senegal because of the Jackie Robinson Foundation that we were friends with. And Max Fadoukel, who was a young 22 year old budding photographer from England, Kenya and India, depending on what day you asked him. And we just we kind of went and we went with this guy named Lou Savatori, who was also photographer, who played this character named Chicky. And we went to Africa and that was in between doing Christo. So I was, you know, on these reccy trips and getting a lot of mileage. And we just went there and had this the Senegalese ballet company there. And everywhere Chicky went with this big suitcase, the suitcase would open up and out came the Senegalese ballet dancers all over Senegal and all over Dakar. So it was a 19 minute movie. We finished like all these things at the eleventh hour. We rented the Ziegfield Theater in New York. Willy's Show was always the first day of Fashion Week in those days, at ten in the morning on a Monday. We rented it and it was a huge it was a you know, what it ever seemed first on this ginormous screen and all the fashion people and a lot of other people because you have to fill the Ziegfield Theater and whatever 2000 seats. Now we had models coming out and Iman and Naomi and all these people were wearing the actual clothes. But in the movie, so that was a real I mean, it's those kinds of creative things where you really helped me say that anything's possible and doing things that no one's ever done before is, you know, part of what I love to do. What happened to Willy? So Willy, like a lot of people in those days, a lot of people now, but certainly it was more heightened in those days was had a drug and alcohol problem, right? And a pretty intense one. And it wasn't until we did an intervention, Laurie and I and his family and got him to go to Betty Ford, which was the place to go with those days. He went to Betty Ford for six weeks and he came back sober. And the last two years of his life before he died at 38, 39 were amazing. That's when we did Christo and that's when we did the movie. And he had this amazing sort of life and then came back from India one time, like we've all done, I did and got sick. I once spent 10 days on my back at the Paris Hilton because I was hallucinating from whatever bug I had gotten in India. So Willy had done it in their way more than I had. He got sick and then it didn't get better. And this is what I know. And there's likely other stories, but I was pretty involved in all this. And so I went away for the weekend to a friend's house on Long Island. And Laurie called me on the phone hardline. So Mark, you got to get back to New York, Willy's at Mount Sinai Hospital. I was like, what? So I went back to the hospital. I rushed back, went to the hospital and he was in a coma and he died the next day. My God. And it was. I didn't know that. Yeah, it was intense. And there's a great company, a couple that are working on a documentary. I'm working on a feature about Willie Smith. But a lot of people in those days, because AIDS was so heightened and there was also Perry had just died. Perry Ellis died six months before. And, you know, a lot of people were dying. But I had never known anyone. To that point, I still haven't to this day that has died so quickly. Right. You usually see this horrible progression like Freddie Mercury and all these, you know, people and he died. And it was, it was, you know, it was horrible. It was a horrible, horrible experience. It was so sudden. And God, he really had this amazing renewed life of being sober and all of those things. But he always said, ironically, that he never, he would never make it to 40. And how old was he when he died? 38, 39. Yeah. Wow. So what did you all do with the business when he passed? You know, we tried to keep it going. The air was gone from the sales. It's no matter what. And this wasn't unique to the to Willy where, but it was just hard to keep it going. And Lori is as smart and as talented as she was and is. It was just hard to do. And so I decided to leave. I met I met some people at CAA who Fox Television was a startup at the time. And I met a guy named Steven Chow, this insane man who created cops on TV and when Fox was new. And so he said, oh, we're doing this thing on Fox Television, where we're going to create all these pods of package stories, Fox Sporting Nudes, Fox Entertainment News, Fox Style News. We want you to do Fox Style News. And here's $10,000. Can you do a pilot? I was like, sure. And so that happened about six months after Willy died. And so I took the $10,000. Steven Micell was doing his sex book. I think it was called Sex. The Madonna one? Madonna. Yeah. And so I interviewed not Steven, but I interviewed Liza Minnelli, ironically, who wrote the forward for my new book, Marina Skiano and some others. Tell, tell everyone who Marina Skiano worked for Vanity Fair. She was a she was all of the manner born all over the world, I guess, and wildly famous and had the thickest accent you could possibly imagine. And so much so that when we did the story, she wasn't particularly happy about it. But I, you know, I was making fun. She would, she kept saying, oh, it's an homage to Marilyn Monroe. When I put a question mark on the screen and say, and say, a what? And then a question. And then I had to do subtitles of homage to Marilyn Monroe is what she said. And so in the middle of that piece, during the Kuwait War, Barry Diller comes into WNYW on 67th Street in Fox and he says, oh, where's Bozak? Where's this Mark Bozak guy? And so I went into the news director's office to meet him and literally behind me, the Kuwait War is happening, right? All the bombs and the news guys are trying to cover it in CNN. And it wasn't a Fox News then. All the stuff and Barry's going, OK, I want to see the piece. I said, well, it's not finished. Because I want to see it. I said, can I finish versus no, I want to see it. So one does that wouldn't it's very good. So I showed it to him and it was, you know, half done. And but it was OK. OK, this is amazing. Now go and do it. I said, no, but I want to finish this because it should air. It goes in so many words, he said, you know, shut up. And I did. But I finished the piece. And that's kind of how I started this 17 year relationship of working with Barry at Fox. I produce all these stories three times a week with incredible editorial freedom like you have, Lauren. You earned it. I probably hadn't earned it at that time. But Fox, in those days, you could tell from the commercials that you were watching Fox Television, right? And and so I did all these stories. Ironically, one of the first stories I want to do is about Bill Cunningham. And Bill, of course, refused to do it like five times. And I was I'm pretty persistent. And I would say, oh, Mr. Cunningham. And I knew him a little from Willie Ware, but no more than any other fashion marketing PR person. It was just pray that he would come and shoot your show and post a picture. No, young fellow, I don't do those kind of things. Go away. And then by the fourth time, he just ripped me. I said, get out of my face. I am not doing this. Right. I said, OK, thank you, Mr. Cunningham. But meanwhile, the next year, my crew, these this great guy, Mario Bertoli from Brooklyn, a video guy, we take the camera out any time we were all over the city doing stories. And inevitably, you see Bill on his bike or at Lincoln Center shooting something. So after a year, we had enough footage. And then I interviewed James Galanos, Bill Blass and Liz Smith to have the sound rights for the piece. The piece ran in the number of 1993. Right a week later is when Barry Diller announced he's leaving Fox Television as the CEO and the creator of Fox Television for Rupert Murdoch. And he was going to QVC. And so much of that kind of happened. And I was like, oh, my God, I have this chance. I'm working with Barry Diller now. And I can do TVs or I'm going to do movies. I had so many ideas in my head. And then I read this and I called him up and I said, what the fuck? What do you mean? You're going to QVC. What are you going there for? And he said, well, it's going to be great. Just never mind. And I said, well, you piece. I said, I said, you piece of shit. And they hung up. And so New Year's Day and one saves these kinds of things. New Year's Day, I have the voice message on my voice answering machine. I'm Barry saying help and you hung up. So I went to QVC in Westchester, Pennsylvania, took the train out there and started this crazy 17 year journey with Barry and Diane von Frescher Berg, who I know just did your podcast. Yes. And we talked about QVC. Yes, indeed. My God. That's first of all, that's another one of the slate of things that's going to be announced here in the next couple of weeks about doing a documentary about that. It's something much bigger. And so you can imagine Barry Diller in Westchester, Pennsylvania and the dynamics. And I was the first guy that he brought in from the outside. OK. So what was it at that point? Because it definitely was on in my household. It was on fire when it was. And it's not like he did anything to help sales. He certainly helped the public perception of it. But it was on fire, much like when I started at Willie were, but on a billion dollar scale in John Rivers and who blamed Barry for her husband's suicide because of the show she had done on Fox. So all of a sudden this dynamic was sort of there. But she was killing it. I mean, she was making money. And so was Richard Simmons making money hand over fist. And so you could you could sort of see the little this and Barry in his usual sort of way, particularly in those days, he's calmed down since then. But he would come, you know, come bouncing down the hallway to my my cubicle, which is surrounded by all my people that worked with me for me and I worked for them and start complaining loudly about them. I was like, oh, I was like, hello, there's like they're right there. I would be whispering they're right there. And so. But, you know, it sort of got into that dynamic. And then Diane's was the first show that I was kind of responsible for. So they had this this pie shaped set that was like a lazy Susan. One was a kitchen set. One was a living room Louis Couture's fake set. But one of them and turned it into this blank, monochromatic set that all the images were or the furniture was coming in and out of the thing. And her clothes look really sort of good on that. And she did really, you know, really, really well. And everybody in Hollywood, everybody in media in Hollywood and Warren came to QVC in Westchester, Pennsylvania, because they had to see what the hell was Barry doing. And I'm talking to Osserman, Sid Sheinkoff, Norman Lear, Ronald Perlman, Calvin Klein, David Geffen, all of them. And I was on the tour for most of them. Yeah. Like me and another great guy named Michael Rourke, who worked with Barry for a long time. And it was, you know, it was the dynamic of that. But you knew you were into something. And the business model for that was which everybody was learning was dollars per minute. We didn't make advertising money. We didn't sell sponsorships. It was how many dollars per minute did Joan Rivers do the last hour? And that's how you would sort of grow these hundred million dollar businesses based on that, because they were exclusive to those. And in most cases, you buy the product anywhere else. Did you live in in Westchester? I did. I moved there with my wife, Susan, before I was a we were parents. We moved first to one sort of townhouse. And that's near Philly. Yeah, it's about 40 minutes west of Philadelphia. Not Westchester, but Westchester, Pennsylvania. It's where what is that artist who's from who's in right near that town in Chadsford, the famous artist. But it was very much like that. My wife was not particularly loving it, but we rescued a greyhound and we had this, you know, great dog that we kind of saved and we embraced the life because we didn't feel like doing it from afar. Barry, on the other hand, would come in on a helicopter three or four times a week from New York and sort of, you know, arrived that way. I just thought, no, this is not the way to do it. But I knew I was not in Kansas anymore, so to speak, when I ordered an orchid for my wife for her birthday. And they and the woman that worked with me sent her an orchid like you wear to on your crusade for you. You kind of were in Kansas. What? It wasn't that you weren't in Kansas. You were in Kansas. I was. And you can visualize the helicopter landing. Barry and I was on it many times with him and other people in Diane coming over Amish country and Amish was right next door to Westchester. And you can almost see the Amish people holding their hats down as the helicopter. Wow. And, you know, everybody knew way ahead of time that Barry was coming to town.

So usually don't go through people's careers, but you're just so fascinating. OK, I want to know everything. Thank you. So we did that for a couple of years and I ran the broadcasting group. I had nothing to do with sales. I didn't know what a P&L was. I knew what I had to deliver a good looking show, great graphics and all that stuff. That was important, super important in those days. And then in the midst of that, he had tried to buy Paramount and then he tried to buy CBS. And he also launched Q2. And Q2 at the time was going to be this upscale shopping channel from Silver Cup Studios, who was on the verge of bankruptcy. And we kind of saved them before Suction the City and 30 Rock and the Sopranos made them much better and successful. And Q2 was going to be Ralph and Calvin, Donna Karan and all these designers were going to sell their frocks on the shopping. OK. But in the middle of all of that, Ralph Lauren came over. There was this negotiation with CBS to buy. CBS was going to buy QVC with Comcast. And David Letterman did his top 10 things of why it's a good idea between QVC and CBS. And then Comcast said, no, at the end of the day, they're going to be a very famous story. They met him at Tito Airport and Ralph and Brian Robertson said, no, we're not doing this. We're not going to be a small fish in a big pond. And so he left and Q2 was gone. Nobody at that time was ever nor were they ever on TV. Although there's something else that might be happening there. We're just going to sell, you know, $1,200 frocks. The only thing that sold were, you know, hot waxers that we used everybody in the company to do demos on to like rip the hair off different parts. So he left and then he got a much bigger chunk and a much bigger say at Home Shopping Network in Tampa. And you went there with him, too. I did. He I went there initially almost within months. And then QVC sued me for non-compete purposes. And I've never heard that that actually happening. Wow. And they sued me because QVC is in the back. Comcast is in Philadelphia. And that is the company of Philadelphia. So they sued me for non-compete purposes in a really ugly battle. And I knew I was in the middle of Barry Diller and Brian and Ralph Roberts. And it had as much or it had something to do with me. But boy, they check your phone records, they check your this and who's this. And I was like, what the hell? And a million and a half dollars later, funded by Mr. Diller, I lost. So I had to stay out of the company for a year. And the day I could go down there, he was very nice. And sent me his G, whatever the number was at that time, plain. And by myself, I flew down to Tampa and arrived there at midnight. The day I could officially start working. And I started working. I became head of broadcasting. And then one day, two years later, he called me from his yacht in Cuba on Thanksgiving morning and said, can you meet me at the studio? Not can you meet me at the studio tomorrow? They called it the campus because it was all these buildings in Tampa. And so I did. And we're walking much like John Gotti and Sam, the Bo Gravano, are walking outside so nobody hears you. And he said, OK, now now you're going to be the CEO. And I know you've never had PNR responsibility for anything. But you know, this is how I do stuff. I think you're going to do a great job. I'll surround you with much smarter people in areas where you're not. And I know who those areas are and don't fuck it up. And and so I did it. And I didn't fuck it up. I did it for four years. We were wildly successful. We did five billion in sales and about two billion dollars in EBITDA when I was running the company. We launched Siri Skincare, which I never saw alone. Wolfgang Puck, Adrian Arpel, Diane Gilman, Suzanne Summers went from 20 million to 150 million. By the time she was done, she was selling air. You know, it was insane. It was insane. But they were killing it. And Joy Magano, who sold more huggable hangers than McDonald's was selling at the time hamburgers. Man, how did you like the movie Joy? This is good. Did you think I've never seen it? I'm going to believe this and nobody lives. I've never seen it. And you know why? First of all, I'm a little nuts that I haven't seen a movie that I've told in thousands upon millions of people that Bradley Cooper played me in the movie Joy because he did because David Russell, we met a bunch of times when he was doing the research on the on the on the movie. So I haven't but I've never seen it. I don't I sort of don't want to burst the bubble that if he's playing me, if there's something negative about it, I just don't want that negative in it. But one day I'll watch them. Yeah, that's interesting. But wouldn't you say if, you know, if, I don't know, who would your favorite contemporary actress, the most, you know, coolest, smartest, beautiful actress played you in a movie? Wouldn't you tell everybody that you knew? For sure. I always have an answer when someone says who would play you in a movie. I always say Catherine Hahn. Yes, fabulous. I think it's easy. You look like a little bit. Yes, well, obviously, the Bradley Cooper, you can see the resemblance that we're sure. Sure. So how did you end up leaving there? Well, after, you know, four years, a little over four years of CEO and two years as the broadcasting guy, and we launched in Japan, we launched in China, we launched in. I was having a blast. But at some point when you work for somebody like Barry for so long, you live under this shadow of if it's really successful, it's because of him. And if it's not so successful, it's because of you. There's nothing wrong with that. I support the whole notion of what that was. But after after doing it for that long, I just burned out. And I said to them, my contract was up and I said, you know, I'm done. And I want to go back to New York and and move there with my with Susan. And so I did. And however many years ago, that was in 2002, 22 years ago, we're still great pals. He's super supportive as is Diane. And I respect those very, very, very much. Those kinds of important relationships that a lot of people left Barry Diller that didn't particularly well. Yeah. But I feel really good about that. And my God, it's they are they are. I can't is is not even the words that they write what they do and their effect and their compassion that they have for all that they focus on. So you leave that business and that was 22 years ago. So and I know you because of this Bill Cunningham documentary and these books you've done. But what did you do from there? And how did you end up doing this doc and getting into that world? So I got when I got back to New York, I we bought a house and I always say it's the house that TV shopping built. And it's nice house. And I bought a slave from the movie Elf, which is a whole another podcast. It was the the sleigh that weighs one ton with the jet engine in the clausometer. I bought it. So it was really from the movie Elf. Amazing. Like from the set, like a set. No, I was and I thought it was a Warner Brothers did the auction. That was early auction. So I know. Awesome. We ought to do it. So I bid 500 bucks. I was the winning bidder at the last hour of the second week that they did it of twelve thousand dollars. And then it was at the Grove in Los Angeles. So I didn't know I was responsible for the shipping of the sleigh. So it cost me another twelve thousand to ship it across the country to my front lawn, Long Island. And then I donated it to the local health side fire department at the end of our street. And they brought it out every year for 22 years. It had an amazing return to New York City last December in front of Bergdorf, Goodman for eight hours and got twenty five million dollars worth of free publicity from every network on the planet that covered. So so I did that. And then I said, OK, let's now I had I had a little runway to really get back into the entertainment business. I bought the rights to a book called television, which Augustine Burroughs wrote was his first before he wrote Running with Scissors. He wrote it in four weeks while it's getting sober and chewing on nicotine gum. And he watched QVC primarily and he wrote television. And I got somebody sent me the galleys before I left HSN. And I read the first line in the book was you exposed your penis on national television. What do you expect me to do? And I thought, oh, I'm buying the rights to that. I met Augustine. I got the rights to start developing this movie. Bradley Cooper, believe it or not, auditioned to play the lead in the movie after wedding crashers. And I still have the tape of that. And so I started doing that. I had the money in the producer's operator. Bradley Cooper was not going to be a big star classic Hollywood story. Nothing unique about that. Then I developed it at NBC, etc. And then money was running out and I had this opportunity to do what I hope to never do, an activist shareholder takeover of the third shopping channel called Shop NBC. It was a messy, messy company that used to be called Value Vision and Shop NBC made an investment in it. It's like a four hundred million dollar company took it over, rebranded it as Yvonne Live and it lasted like a year and a half. And any company is messy. You write about them all the time, Lauren. But public ones are messier and messier ones that have been that way for a long time or even harder. So you have to have a board that really supports you. And I didn't. But I did launch Beakman 1802. Josh and Brent, the guys from Sharon Springs, New York. If you ever watch Shitt's Creek and the Apocathe area, it's based on Josh and Brent. They launched from zero on Yvonne and now they're two hundred and fifty million dollar business and they're in a great brand. I left that, came back to Long Island. A week later, Bill Cunningham died. Right. And Kim Haastreider, my dear friend forever from Paper Magazine, posted on Facebook, I think in those days that he died. And I think I like everybody else was sad. Right. Anybody that had anything to do from near or far with Bill Cunningham felt very sad that they lost a friend. Right. I said to my son, Jude, at the time, he was a, I said, let's go in the basement and find the beta tapes of the interview that I did with Bill Cunningham. 1994, that was supposed to be a ten minute interview for him to play or turn into a one minute video to play at the CFDA Awards for him to accept an award. He did not want to accept, but the times made him on the stage of Lincoln Center. So, ironically, he called me to do this interview while I was at QVC and Richard Simmons was on the air. And I thought he was, it was a scam call that Bill Cunningham, first of all, how did he get my number or even know who I was? But somebody knew, had seen my piece. He doesn't have a TV. Didn't see it. And he called me. And so I went to his place at Carnegie Hall and a ten minute turned into about four hours. And for whatever reason, he told me his entire life story, like stuff that nobody had seen. So I did the one minute video. I put it in my basement, went back to my eating job. Then he died. And six months later, I rented the screening room at Soho House and invited a bunch of people that I hadn't seen in 30 years and a bunch of the the viper pit of people at the New York Times, ruthlessly protective of Bill, some too much so that sort of vicariously living through him. And I played the raw tape because if I didn't do that, I would have they were all like, who the fuck is this? The CEO of Home Shopping Network is going to make a movie about our Bill Cunningham. Is he kidding? But I played it. And three hours later, literally half the people were weeping because they as much as some of them like Ruben Toledo, who did this poster and Mel Toledo, who's past, who I dedicate the movie to, they had never even heard Bill talk like this. And and I learned half an hour into the interview with him to just shut up. I had gotten the sound buds I needed. But at some point, he was just going off. And I didn't know what Shanie None was. And I didn't. That's my next book about Jackie Kennedy and Shane None and Bill Cunningham. But I didn't know. But they Ruben and Isabel of all the people there just stayed in my corner. And when some people, you know, typical in these stories, some people aren't. They just pushed and pushed. And so I made this documentary. I taught myself how to edit on this computer and Final Cut Pro. I dumped all the footage to a digital file. I didn't want to go and interview a bunch of other famous people that liked Bill, because the other documentary that had come out called Bill Cunningham, New York, done did that already. So I thought, well, who's Tom Ford be an Anna Winter scene? So I said, you know what, this is pretty good this way, just as long as I could get access to his archive, which will mark my words, the most important archive in the history of New York City. It's three million images and documents that he saved on purpose, even though he said he didn't. He was just like to document things. It was very, very well curated. I got into the archive just me and the times have been in there. And I picked all these images. I made the movie. It came out February of 2020 with Andre Leontali as my sort of opening night guest. It was a big hit at the Angelica, a big hit in uptown in LA, which every filmmaker wants their first opening weekend to be. And it was going to open in 150 theaters on March the 13th of 2020, which is the same week the Willie Smith exhibit, 85 percent of which came from my basement, by the way, because I saved yeah, stuff, cloth didn't open. And my film came open around the world. Way worse things happened to people more than my movie not opening. But it was it was hard. It was hard. I was on this world tour and getting all this sort of adulation and re-relevancy and all these things that everybody craves most of the time. And so it went away. I launched a thing called Live Rocket, which was going to be like a TV shopping for millennials. Live Rocket Studio that I had down at the Seaport, a block from where you did your McNally book signing when you launched your amazing book, by the way. It is amazing. And I haven't read a lot in the last six months because of everything I'm doing, but I did read that for. But it's really great. I hope it's doing it. Seems like it's doing amazing. It's good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's good. That's really it's great. So I want to work to promote this stuff. And how much support do you get from your publishing group? Just out of curiosity. OK, so a lot of support. Exactly. No, I mean, look, like. What what I will say is I'm really lucky. I also have a where I work. My day job has been incredibly supportive and done a lot. They threw me a book party. They have their our internal PR team has helped out with stuff. So I'm really lucky. Also, I get to promote the book in every single thing I write. And also the company at large has my boss has written stuff about the book. So like I'm really lucky. I have a lot of promotion and also internally. I mean, the publishers, it's a very I was at hold. And it's a very commercially driven imprint. So they did support and helped us like they booked us. Good morning, America. We got a ton of we've had a ton of coverage in the New York Times. We had an amazing review. We've been recommended best book of the year so far. All that's so very good. I would say that like the thing that, and you know this, a lot of what is important with with book promotion now is like book book Twitter, book book talk and book talk really like tick talk stuff. And that I think we would have had to hire someone else to do that part of it. And I don't we, you know, I don't know if I'm going to come out of this profitable. So it's so that's a good company, Lauren, in terms of coming out of any of these books profitably, unless you're speaking. Yes, it's just the way it is. But you know this for sure. And I see it obviously with everything that you've just described. And I have a similar or different experience that knowing ahead of time that publishers do amazing jobs and they dive in creatively with you and they create all this process. But by the time your book comes out, it's not the only book that they're publishing at that particular time. Well, you work it. Yeah.

Each spring, 23 Pulitzer prizes are awarded for distinguished journalism, books, drama and music. There was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll, and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before found out. It was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are and columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th. Following listen on Apple podcasts, the Odyssey app, Spotify or wherever you get your podcast. So what did you do? So this was supposed to we're supposed to be on this grand tour. You're supposed to have all this stuff and also the the Willie Smith thing got stalled. So it did end up going. But that's interesting. I didn't realize it was supposed to launch at that time. Yeah, that's a very same week it was it was supposed to happen. So, you know, COVID has caused lots of drama for for the world in its personal life and business and self mental health and all of these different kinds of things. And I'm I certainly wasn't immune to it. I lost a member of my family. I'll do that. And, you know, it's not really, really tough to tough and really tough this past summer. OK. Yeah. You know, specifics aren't really necessary. But all of a sudden, some angels flew into my life, some that you know that I can't tell you. But there's some that you know of and save me. And so instead of being where I was supposed to be on Wednesday, the first week of December in a place that wasn't fun, I was at Bergdorf-Goodman. And thanks to Linda Fargo and connecting me with Shatosie Abbe, where I think I first met you in person. Harris. Yes. Oh, yes. At the Sakai show, the incredible show where everything was that everything looked like a dress, but nothing was a dress or something like that. Yeah, that's that goes one more layer deeper into your world that I never quite understand how what that even means. But I sort of get it. And all of a sudden I met this opening of Bergdorf-Goodman and I am in the freaking window where Bill Cunningham used to hang out, you know, on 57th and 5th. And David Hoey did the window and we invited 150 people, 300 people. So showed up and. I worked it right. You work it for everybody. Vanity Fair, a lot of people just did endless, endless, endless. Because you did a collaboration with Shatosie on a on a work jacket. It started out as her just wanting to use a quote of those fashion is the armor is to survive every day life. And then when I started talking to them before Paris that time, I said, look, by the way, do you know, I did this documentary about Bill Cunningham? And by the way, I'm doing this book. Is there something we could consider doing deeper? And I went to Paris. She wore the shirt. We had a meeting there. And the deeper became that she created the inspirational blue jacket. Fifty of them from Bergdorf that sold out within like three days for $1,200. And a bunch of shirts and and sayings and hoodies that all went like like hotcakes. And but what those things do, and this is where you take the book and knowing that the that the financial gain is not necessarily great. But boy, when you do it and CAA comes with you to the to the book opening at Bergdorf, which they did, and then they sign you to, you know, a pretty amazing kind of representation. And I'm doing five more books now. And I'm amazing people circling the the notion of making my book, the Battle of Versailles into a movie, my documentary into a series. And we talked about this before, Lauren, about. With so many documentaries or so many series and streaming things about all the famous designers, you have to really pick and choose totally subjectively about what you like and what you don't like. And so many of them end up being these stories about drugs and sex and, you know, all the things that quote unquote sell. And you sort of lose the perspective about what was this designer all about? Yeah. And you know which ones they are. We don't need to name them necessarily. But here's a guy like Bill. Who has an amazing had an amazing life and never it doesn't matter. They never smoked, he never drank and there's so much more to him as a character and me as a filmmaker, his, you know, perstickiness and edginess came through in the book. He had a five page diary that's in my book that no one's ever seen and pictures that no one's ever seen. Yeah. That make it really, you know, exciting. So as someone who understands the entertainment industry better than most people in the fashion industry and you understand the fashion industry better than pretty much every person in the entertainment industry, why do you think it has been so hard to get the fashion industry right on screen? You know, there are amazing sports movies. There's amazing like no one's like, oh, they just can't really nail sports. They didn't really nail baseball in field of dreams. Like people it's you and maybe I mean fashion is just as universal. And yet like I can think of very few films or television shows about the industry that feel like connected to the way it actually is. It's not even about like being realistic. It's about it like having the right feeling of what the industry makes you feel. Why do you think it's been so hard to nail it? Well, I've lately been using this analogy that even Hannibal Lecter, you felt something for him. Yeah. You had something in his portrayal writing and directing that you felt something for them. What happens is these characters become so unlikable and the fashion industry becomes such a place of unlikeableness. Yeah. And it's not the only industry, but sure is right up there near the top in terms of people's perception of it. And the challenges that one has working within that thing when you put yourself in the line of fire for better or worse. And I think that Hollywood comes in and the most successful, I guess, of the last 15 years, you could say is Devil Wars Prada, which was fun, really successful, et cetera. But when you get into like some of the others and I want this to be careful with them because I'm talking to a bunch of them. Totally. Yeah. And there's no reason to. There's no reason. They just miss the essence of the character. And in some cases, the designers had no essence that was amiable. They were nasty and they were, you know, they were ruthless and in ways that were personal business in all kinds of ways that I think doesn't enable you to. And then I look at Bill Cunningham and boy, do I look at Willie Smith. And they weren't announced to that in either of those two guys. And it's not that they were saints, but boy, are they characters to delve into and tell amazing stories about. Yeah. It's interesting. So so you ended up signing this deal with Rosoli, right? So you're going to do five books and your first book was the bill book. And then you did the Versailles book, the Versailles book and then the bill book. So tell me a bit about the Versailles book and what, because obviously Robin Gavana had done that like big, big book, reported book on that. But that is a story that so many people still don't know. I was at the CFDAs last night and Donna Karen and Todd Oldham, who obsessed it was such a dream to see him in person. He they presented to Stephen Burroughs speaking of, you know, the first like major black fashion designer in America. And Donna was talking about when she went to Versailles for Ann Klein and he was, Stephen was there for his own brand and how they beat the French and all that stuff. But what do you think is so important about that time? And like it has been, if you, I mean, if you work in fashion, you know about it. But it's, it has been mined quite a bit. But like, what did you feel like was new? Sure. So and being mindful of that, you dive into a project, you do as much research as you can. Yeah. You certainly do it, you know, as well as anybody does. And you just, you know, and you, you, so I watched the first documentary, then there was another one on that M2M did that was kind of like a reenactment. That wasn't so particularly great. Of course, I read Robin's book with very little pictures to be noted on Rupus. And then during a year and a half ago, sort of, you know, post trying to recover from COVID, I read all the stories about the 50th anniversary of Versailles that had happened a year and a half ago and different people were doing different things. Ann Klein was doing something. I think the Met did something. And then I thought, I get up on Sunday morning, I was looking at my scanned files from Mills Archive, which I had 25,000 scanned images of the three million that I chose. And in my documentary, he talks about Versailles as being the most incredible show he's ever seen, and he's seen them all. And then I started looking at all these pictures and I said, you know what, I've never seen these before. No one has ever seen these before. And then I found his eight page diary. And I definitely know no one's ever read this before. So I reached out to Ivan Shaw, my great friend at Condi Nests. I said, Ivan, I want to try to do a book. What do I do? Oh, you got to write a PDF. And he gave me, sent me some samples. And I just, I don't work well in two dimensional sort of writing of, on, for example, I hate PDFs, period. So I said, you know, I'm going to make a move of a seven minute sizzle reel of Bill from the book, images that I had that no one's ever seen before. And I sent it to Rizzoli and they said, yes, two days later. And that kind of began that relationship. And now I have these other projects that are that are exciting as hell. But I'm doing them as launching pads for everything else because coffee table books, I have much more appreciation for them now, now that I have a book that's on the coffee table, but they often indicate passion projects, Lauren. And we know what those mean. That's like documentary or passion projects, but they don't, you know, help you eat. Yeah. So what are you doing to help you eat? Well, consulting. Well, no, no, no, to piss on consulting because it's a great thing. But no, this relationship that I now have with CAA has exploded in a really good way, even as of like the last month. And so while in LA for LA Fashion Week, where I'm showing the movie, the documentary and selling my book with some with Pat Cleveland and some other people that I'll tell you about offline, because I can't say their names yet, are are going to do it. But there's one in particular that wants to make this movie like really badly as a scripted feature movie with a really, really big named actress that starts with Z and it ain't Liza. So that's that's what's exciting. That's where the real potential, if you're going to put all this work into something that the real potential reward, if it's good, works. Yeah. What a life. Yeah. OK, two questions for you. This usually we only do an hour, so we're we're going to have a little extra. Diane was also longer because you've done more cool stuff than than most people. But one one question like quickfire round. What do you think of the transformation of like video shopping? I don't that's not the right word, but I I've written a lot about that company network that is backed by Jimmy Iovine. I mean, I have I mean, yeah. Yeah. And I've written a bit about Aaron, who runs that used to where complex and that's like drops a lot of like Merchie type stuff. I don't I think it's doing well. I don't know. And then also just like YouTube itself is like a shopping platform. Where do you see that? Because the thing that never really happened was it never did become high fashion the way that Q2 inspired. And I remember I know M2M. I don't think they had any commerce to start, but I I knew all the folks. I did a bunch of stories about M2M when when they WME tried to do that or whatever endeavor I am. Whoever was actually the the part of that company running it. But and Susan and all those people. But what do you think like the future of that type of shopping is? Is it just the like shopper selling to Chinese consumers via TikTok? Or what do you what do you think? Yeah, you know, that will always exist, whether it's fast fashion, just ordering from them or whether they're going to do live selling and all that. And, you know, I've followed this live selling business because I got thrust into it at a young age for a long time. And every first two things I'll answer. Hollywood has tried forever to incorporate selling into live into scripted content, reality shows, etc. And there is not one that you can name that has ever done any scalable thing that you'd want to write about in a positive kind of way. Yes, mixed entertainment was selling. I will I will watch you with you, but you can't do both. I'm not going to point and click and Jennifer Anderson sweaters going to come flying off the screen from friends. Yes, then you take all these new guys, new people, companies, brands like the ones that you mentioned and a bunch of others, including my live rocket two years ago. And they forget a bunch of basic things that Greg Rinker, who you happen to know, who created Guthi Rinker, understands still to this day because he still has Cindy Crawford's brand and Jainl's brand and they they understand what exclusivity is. They understand all of those things. Instagram is not the place to scale your business to. It's just not. It's just and if you don't have distribution, when I ran HSN, we had 100 million homes, right? And we did three billion a year. QVC did eight billion a year. So find another scenario. We have 100 million homes and I kind of have. And then you can get upscaled and scale upscaled and create an environment and a platform where everybody's going to want to go. And I'm as excited about that if I can say with my CEO hat back on, as I am about anything, because so many people are circling it. And I know, you know, not all of them, but I know a lot of them. And I just think that you have to understand the basics. Is it exclusive? Is there an impulsive reason to be live? There has to be an impulsive reason to be live. That's why Amazon Live doesn't work. Yeah. It's not impulsive and they never sell out. There's no reason to buy during that period. Yeah. That's a great answer and that I agree with you with the content to commerce. I think people just don't understand. That that's the case in a bunch of different mediums of the content to commerce conversion. And they don't understand how that actually works. And the second question is, what designers are excited about that are around now? We've talked about Sakai. Is there anyone who you just think is doing a really interesting job? I just came from the CFDAs where like a lot of really young, cool designers, Loire, Willie Chavarria, Diotima, like all these people are really like coming up and take, you know, brand marquee names that didn't exist five years ago in retail. Yeah. So my opinion would be different than yours because you are a, you know, a historian, incredibly smart about that perspective of it. And, you know, you're right, you're wrong, but you have a point of view on it. Mine is never a point of view about who's the next up and coming this person. But the ones that get me excited or interesting having just the Paris for the first time in my life covering Fashion Week where I covered a bunch of shows. Amazing. Sakai and all the Japanese companies that showed in that day, and Joe from Once and Abe and blah, blah, blah. Japanese day. Yeah, it was definitely Japanese day. I had such an incredible time. But I think if you look at just people that get me excited is Todd's nephew. Presley Oldham. I agree. I'm a huge fan. That to me, I just want to like go and have a meeting with people like that and make sure they don't fuck it up in terms of being so creative because those days are gone. Yeah. And people like that that I get really, really excited about. And some of the collaborations I think that exists right now. And one in particular is a certain DJ that has a mustard in his name that wants to do something related to Willie. And I didn't even know this person is Honey Dijon. I didn't know. Oh yeah, who works with the comb people. Yeah, I didn't had no idea who Honey Dijon was. But this guy, a friend of mine texted me, he said, oh, you know, Honey Dijon wants to connect with you. I said, what the fuck is Honey Dijon? I thought it was a strong. Doesn't there like a swear word in the name? Oh, I don't know that one. Yeah, I think that like the middle name is in quotes. And it's like, because I wrote about when they first started working with the comb group and comb started funding. Well, now it doesn't have one. But it used to have a she used to have like a name, something, some curse word in her name. Oh, I have no idea. I'm coming up. It seems to have been. I met her in Paris. She came to Paris and we had a whole great discussion in Paris about the book and all kind of exciting things. But I like those kinds of things. And you know, the revolving door that you write about all the time that happens. You can't help but write about it because that's what your job is. Yeah. I think it gets lost in translation so much, but it's generational. It's up and down trends. It's all the things that are never, ever, ever going to go away. But I think the young people that if you can embrace them, and I really do, I have this sort of fatherly desire, not necessarily the time, but desire to say, hey, don't do this, don't do that. Because I did it and I screwed it up. And I think that that's where I get excited about it. I can't really speak to Filo, whatever you call it. I don't really follow them like that. But I get excited about cool things like that. Yeah, I agree about Presley. I saw his stuff at... There's a vintage store that has James Valoria that's in a China... I'm sure you've been to the... It's like in a Chinatown mall. And I started going there very early, like before they had the New York Times shopping story, which I'm usually not that early to stuff. But then they... I think they're open permanently. And I love the two who started that. But they were carrying Presley's jewelry really early. And yeah, I'm a big fan. And you know what it was? Honey, so Honey Dijon, the line of merch is called Honeyfucking Dijon. Oh, there you go. Okay. I knew it. I knew that there was a swear in there. Yeah, I saw it. It's cute. I was like, I'll do this. Exactly. Yeah, it's very cute. But yeah, I get it. And I think you're right. I think the way you judge... That's what I wanted to know what you're excited about, not about... Like I have to evaluate these people and these... Like as businesses and as creative pursuits in this very clinical way almost. And it's not... It all often... I'm a big fan of Phoebe Philo's, but I try not to let that influence how I write about her. Even though I would just love to be like, she's the best ever. I try to be... Interrogate what she's doing because she deserves it. But yeah, I get what you mean. Like... And I think that's why it's fun because you are drawn to people with like a lot of energy and magic. And so I was curious, like who interests you? That's really is. At the end of the day, and I'll leave you with this, I think that one of the things that I say all the time to younger people, if they're in the room and want to hear or if I happen to be doing something or speaking about it, I love it in a big kind of way is that if you're going to work with, and you can guess where I came up with this phrase or this feeling, that if you're going to be an asshole, then you better be really, really, really good. Otherwise, you're just an asshole. Right? That's how I felt then. Today, I feel like even if you're an asshole, even if you're really talented and you're an asshole, I hope I don't have to work with you. It's true. It's true because I've been thinking about that a lot because I've been writing a lot about Abercrombie and Fitch and Mike Jeffries and mostly trying to write about his leadership skills and how he built that business because that business was remarkable. It was incredible. And the reality of it is, you can't act like the way he acted. And it's not even like, yes, all the really bad stuff that he's been charged allegedly did. Yeah, of course. But even just the way I had an anecdote in the story the other day about how he yelled at these people for an hour and a half because a shirt's thread was too thick and it was supposed to be sheer. The earlier version was sheer and he was mad how it looked on the mannequin. You can't behave that way anymore. And it's an interesting thing because what do you lose? Do you lose something by not giving someone permission to do anything? I don't think so. Look, they've recovered quite well. But is it as exciting? Is it as cool and fun and interesting of a brand as it was in 1997? I don't think so. It's great and I'm happy for them. But what matters at the end? I can guarantee it's a public company that they're much happier that those kinds of things don't matter to them. No. One quota. It's how many, whatever the share price is. But it has resurrected. And just like Victoria's Secret is desperately trying to. So final question on that. Do you think that the way the world works now where you can't be a jerk? Do you think the world is better now than it was 20 years ago in that way for creative people? Like, do you think that there's more freedom or less freedom? And so I think there is as much free as much creativity as there was then as there was in the 60s and all those sort of generational periods of super creativity. The world is insane right now. And it's upside down. And I think today, and Bill says it in the movie, today is just as exciting as it was, you know, in the 50s, in the 40s. That's what gets me all excited. And I it's in my blood in terms of that. But I don't think that you have to be that. And at the end of the day, finally, for sure, don't ever be referred to Lauren as the first thing you can never be referred to is nice. And here's my story. If someone says, what do you think that Lauren Sherman person? And if they say, oh, she's nice, there's always a but right after that. Yeah, you could be nice. Second, oh, my God, she's so talented. She knows everybody and she's a nice person. Second is great. If you're first, I guarantee for the rest of your life, you're going to hear these stories from people talk about somebody else. And they'll say, and if nice is first, you're fucked. If it's second or third, it's really good. That's how I look at life in that sort of way and personally. Well, Mark, you're very nice, but also a lot of other things. Not nice first, I would say. OK, I would say you have ingenuity. Listen, I've been doing this for a while. I'm grateful. I'm honored, Lauren, that you that you wanted to do this. And I am not making up a blowing smoke that exists in Los Angeles in a big way. But I'll be out there in a couple of weeks. I'm sure I'll get a lot of smoke. I look forward to seeing you and the feeling is mutual. Thank you for for taking the time. Cheers. Thank you all very much.
