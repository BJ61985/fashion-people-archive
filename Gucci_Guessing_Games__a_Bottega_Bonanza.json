Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Puck's fashion and beauty memo line sheet. And today with me on the show is fashion writer, stylist and newsletter queen Becky Malinsky to talk Milan, Paris, Nike and everything in between. Let's get started. Hi there. Hope you're having a great week. I am in Paris. I'm settling in. I got here yesterday. Today is probably my freest day of the year. I was able to write yesterday so I didn't have a ton of writing to do today. And I just did a little reporting in the morning, made some calls, talked to some people. Then I ran some errands. I also went for a run, which was really nice. It's the first one I've been able to do in Europe. Hopefully I'll get one more in tomorrow and then I won't have any more time. But I also went to Dover Street Market today in the Moray and I have to say you should... I ran there and you should also run there. Don't walk. It's amazing. I'd say I've been to pretty much every single Dover Street except for... I've been to Japan, Paris, London, Los Angeles, New York. I've not been... I think they have one in Shanghai maybe and maybe in Seoul as well. I'm not positive. I haven't been to those. But this one is really unique. I think it was probably a bunch of apartments that they strung together. And so each room feels like you're discovering a whole new thing. The way they have it merchandised is really amazing. Like a bag on a podium, not connected to anything else. And the brands, they sort of pair together. Like Bottega and Prada Mew Mew makes a lot of sense, but also tells a fun story. And then there was this incredible art in the courtyard, this giant pile of chairs by Tadashi Kawamata. There was also, I'm forgetting the name of the artist that Bottega worked with last season, but did those cacti invitations? The big glass cactus was in the hallway. But this pile of chairs was just stunning. Even if you don't care about fashion, you just like, arc, you should go to it. And it was interesting, like the sawdust was falling from the chairs and there was a person, I think, expressly there just going around sweeping the sawdust up. It was an interesting moment. And I also had lunch at the Rose Cafe and Adrian Jaffee, Ray Kawakubu's husband, a business partner, he was in there doing a meeting and it was just really nice. I mean, the food was very good. I had a great day. I am still recovering from the whirlwind that was Milan. The beginning of the week in Paris is very slow. So this is publishing on Tuesday. I'm recording this on Monday. And I'll probably do like three or four shows a day until Thursday. Then it picks up again. Then I leave on October 2nd. It feels too long, but I, you know, I always say, get enough reporting done here in a week to last me month. So it's worth the time. I think next year with the Oscars and all that stuff, I'll rearrange a little bit. But, you know, you can't complain about being in Paris. And I get to see so many people that I don't get to see a lot. I had dinner with my friend, Delphine, last night and having dinner with another friend tomorrow night and all that good stuff. And then also just getting to see a lot of industry contacts that I don't even get to see in New York when I'm in New York. So it's really fun. You should check out Line Sheet for some of that scoop that I'm getting. I also have further details on the arrival of Nike's new CEO and some very interesting stuff there. We're going to be watching that really closely in the next few months, I'm sure, and ongoing because Nike's one of the most important companies in fashion. You might not think of it that way, but it really is. And I also have some updates on the Prawns of School or business that you should check out. It's an interesting one to look at over the years. I've been covering them so closely for so long and always curious what's next for them. So check that out. And also I will start picking up the SMS texts again. So you know what I'm up to this week when I'm seeing what I'm hearing all that good stuff. And if you already have my phone number, feel free to text me with information or just to say hi. I'd love to hear from you. Glad to have Becky back on. And she did not make it to Europe this year because of a lot of stuff she has to do in the US that was more important than going to shows, unfortunately. But we've been talking back and forth all weekend about the Milan show. So we're going to discuss what she thinks and guess we should get started. Becky Malinsky, welcome back to fashion people. Thank you for having me. I went to my Derm today. My Paris Derm. OK. And what'd they say? She blazered a bunch of stuff off my face. 60 years. She's reached. She's like a real doctor. It's not like a med spa. Someone else was talking recently about how like going to the Derms in LA versus New York versus Paris versus like what they're going to tell you. Was it you? I think it was me. No. No. Or it was it was Melanie Masser and I think this is Melanie Masser and is how I found this woman. Oh, amazing. And she is also I don't want to reveal who it is, but she is also the daughter of someone who lives in New York who we all know. Oh, interesting. I'll tell you offline. I don't want to give this woman's name out. But I thought that was interesting. It was like everyone relax. Your face is great. Yes. So I found this woman through Melanie. Because Melanie said, if you want to try Botox, this woman does Botox. She's a real doctor. She'll give you like a mole check. And then I went and she said, you don't need Botox. She wants me to get this like procedure where my like basically an eye lived. But she said, she's like, do it when you're here for 10 days and you can just chill out. So maybe I'll do it the summer or something if I if I go to Europe. But she did like laser some issues on my face. And also on my like, she did a whole body scan. It was like, she's a she's a legit doctor. And last time I went, she only takes cash or check. And I didn't have my debit card. I obviously never checked. So she's like, just pay me next time. And this time, oh my God, she didn't have any change. So she I still owe her money. But it's like to do all of that work with 60 euros. I was like, like less than a copay. It's crazy. She's like, come back in a year, I'll do it again. It's fine. So if you need anything, let me know. She gave she recommended a serum. She says, my skin's too sensitive to use retinol. It's great. I mean, it's it's one of those things that only someone who has privilege would get such a discount. I go to Europe five times a year. So I go to Paris at least three or four times a year. I can easily have my dermatologist in Paris, but I am a person who goes to Paris three or four times a year. Whereas in LA, like even if you have insurance, it's not going to be that cheap. Yeah, no, definitely not. It's wild. One other funny thing that happened to me today that I would love to share with you is that I went to dinner with Delfine DelVal last night and she was like, oh, you have to get this lip balm. It's so good. So I pick up this lip balm at the pharmacy with a bunch of other stuff that my dermatologist recommended and I been applying it all afternoon. And I go to get on like the puck weekly call and my lips are completely white. And I was like, what is wrong? Am I sick? I look in the mirror. I look, it's actually not lip balm. It's like a color corrector or a cover up or something. My lips were like, you get the wrong one. Yeah, I got the wrong one. And you could sort of, I put on lipstick before anyone saw me because it was really scary. So when you go back, will you get me one too? Yeah, I'll get you one. Um, I also, yeah, send me a list of anything you need. Unfortunately, the other update I have for you is that Arquette officially has no kids clothes in their store in Paris now. The powers that be at Arquette, this is not cool. They have some baby clothes, no kids clothes. So I'm going to just do what I always do, which is ship a bunch of stuff to my friend's office, who then sends it to LA for me. But I'm very sad because I wanted to buy Fritz his, his next wardrobe. I don't do a ton of Arquette for kids. I, I do a lot of Petit Patau pajamas, like in two sizes, a fall and Monoprix. And then for the season. And then once he's grown out next season, buy the whole new wardrobe. Yeah. I, I have bought the Petit Patau pajamas on your recommendation and I will do so again. Yeah, they're not tight. No, they're really. American pajamas are too tight. Yeah, they're really nice. My, my feeling on Monoprix, I actually bought, I bought Fritz a cute sweater. I didn't get him that barber-esque field jacket. Because it's too puffy. Uh, and then I bought my friend who's about to have a baby and who has an almost three year old, a couple things for her kid. My thing is Thomas, you dress your, your child in, I would say like, he dresses pretty preppy, right? Yeah. Pretty, pretty classic. Classic is a good word. Yeah. Some striped sees Fritz is a little more. Yeah. And a little more LA. I would say a little more Scandinavian. Like, oh, okay. Okay. He wears a lot of bright colors. I don't dress him in like the muted tones, the sandy colors that are very popular in LA. He does dabble in milk teeth, the LA based store and like some of that Korean fast fashion stuff. But generally, I mean, he wears a lot of Arquette and some upgrades to Boba shows, but it's really like very primary colors, a lot of like blue and red and green. And so Monoprix is a little more muted and classic looking. So yeah, like great Navy pants. Yes. Great khaki pants. Yeah. But also last time I was there, every single thing said Brooklyn. Uh, yes. I was like, okay, this is not the vibe. I'm not bringing all of this back to New York. So that was a bummer. So I think last year, but we, he got like one pair of khaki pants, which was sad. And now I'm not going this season. So well, we'll, we'll do a big haul next season. If you need anything, I'm available next season. We'll revamp the whole wardrobe because he will have grown out of all of it. He will. I'm sure it is. He, he's just very extremely tall also. Right. So extremely tall. Yeah. Love it. I love being tall. I always say to Fritz, you're allowed to drink coffee when you're six feet tall. Yeah. Is he asked, does Thomas ever ask? Fritz is always like, can I have some coffee? And I say, no, not until you're six feet tall. Yeah. No, yeah. I say it's a grown up drink. Thomas, I accident, I mean, I gave him Coca-Cola and I opened that gate. And now though, no, like every day he wakes up in the morning, Coca-Cola. Today is a special day. And today be a special day every day. Oh my God. Poor guy. That's awesome. Well, I know that, that you're running around with him and doing a bunch of way more important than fashion week stuff. But what did you think of the shows in Milan? I was sad that you weren't there to experience them with me. I know I was sad and thank you for having me because you know Milan is my, my spirit city. I thought of you often, not just because we were texting the whole time. Yeah. I mean, obviously stand out favorites, Vali and Bottega Veneta. Oh my God. Too good. Too good. Too good. I mean, it's so fascinating and amazing that ballet is like the show to, show to miss. So ballet is really interesting right now because obviously Simone Bellotti. I don't know if that's how you pronounce his surname, but he. Bellotti is, has been the designer for three seasons and was sort of a surprise. Ruygi, the rude designer, he was there for a while. They like brought in this LA guy to remake ballet. It was a unmitigated disaster. They bring his sort of second in command interviews to take the top job, take the top job. We all go to the show and are like, oh, we're just going to the show as a favorite of all the nice PRs who work on ballet and we're blown away and I'll fall in love with it. And it's just so good. Like it's very wearable, but there are ideas. I was talking to him yesterday or Saturday after the show and he was saying, like, he's very into Gili Romeo Gili. Is it Romeo Gili? Well, I don't know Romeo. It's fine. You're American, but like that was like sort of the silhouette he was looking at. And I thought that was interesting because so many of the vintage stores that are really popular right now, like carry tons of Gili and it's, it's like the person who would buy ballet is buying vintage Gili. So that made a lot of sense, but it feels like there are ideas in it and it's emotional, but it's also like extremely wearable. Even the bags are good and feel unique and doesn't like look like anything else on the market. And it's just like a brand that is conjuring a lot of fandom at the same time. It got sold to an American private equity firm in August and they kind of buried the news. No one knew this company. I've actually written about them a lot. They own intermix. They own Cheddar News. They own like it's called Regent. They're based in LA. They own tons of stuff and they also own Escada and Club Monaco. But this is like the real, the first brand that they've bought that I know about that I cover that wasn't like dormant. That is like a hot brand. They mostly own brands that are sort of like not really moving right now. And now they own this brand that's really moving. So I'm interested to see what happens with it. Yeah. I wonder how long that was in the works. Like was it in the works before the brand started moving? You know, because it's very new at three seasons is nothing. No. And it's funny today. I wanted to go to the store and buy something because you're in Europe. There isn't a store in Paris. No, I know. There's only one in Milan. I know. Is there one in LA though? I mean, in New York. There's one in New York. There's one in New York and I've ordered something online once and it came from Coast Amesa. So I looked that up. I was like, Oh my God. Yes. There one at South Coast Plaza. There must be. Yeah. Yeah. But that's the, it's the question. And he, I don't know. It's just like he came out of nowhere. I feel like all the other houses that need people are probably looking at him. It's just like popped immediately. Popped immediately. The clothes are great. They're simple, but they're interesting and covetable. And the price is right in a strange way. Obviously we're still talking about luxury price points, but when everyone is, you know, barrier to entry is a thousand dollars. All of a sudden a $684 pair of suede booties is great. Yeah. Yeah. And the shapes just feel great. We feel like you want to put it on right now. But this season felt much tougher, much more interesting. Like he definitely seems more comfortable to take risks. I agree. The shapes were really cool. I thought it was good. Tim Blanks went backstage. He knew every single reference. Yeah. Did he talk about the Nikola that I immediately said I didn't mention Nikola, but you're right. If they had a hint of the early 2000s, Balenciaga, florals and sculptural and. I 100% agree. No, he didn't mention that. He mentioned Gile, and that was not in the group conversation that was me and him chatting later. He talked more about kind of art. He kept referring to ballet as a project and sort of looking at like, not redefining what Swiss means, but you think of, he had a really good quote that was like, I was like, I wonder if a PR fed this Tim, but I don't think so because it was just so quotable and digestible, but it was something about like, and I'd used it in my piece, bankers, chocolate and precision, like that's what Switzerland's about more than bankers, chocolate and precision or something. But it was fun hearing him and Tim Blanks riff and talk about all these. Not so obscure, but like kind of obscure art references and everything. Not really obscure, but just only Tim could have that conversation backstage. Whereas most people are like, what's that grommet all about? And I'm just like, I love you. You're so great. You're so great. And so kind. So kind. Just like, it's just cool. It's a great story. It's like this, this person worked at Gucci for 15 years was the menswear designer at Gucci, takes this job at Bali because things are changing at Gucci. I think he left three months before Alessandro left, which I had thought he left after Alessandro, but he didn't. He left three months before and takes this job under this guy, Ruiji, who gotta say, I love that guy. When I interviewed him, he said to me, I interviewed him before Bali launch. It was like, my story was to debut the new logo, which is hilarious. That was a story, but I like, I twisted it into something bigger. And he told me that when he was growing up, he used to sell stuff on eBay and he would put a designer tag in it and sell it for more money. And that's when he realized like how to do pricing, which is very clever. But anyway, goes to work under this guy, Ruiji, who I think has the best intentions. It was not right, gets the job afterwards and becomes the toast of like the town or at least a very particular group of fashion editors. But you know, everybody was there. Cheryl Hines was there. I saw that. Why? This may be a strange wife. She's very good friends with the investor. Okay, this makes all a lot more sense. So I'm excited to meet the new investor and because I do write about so many of the companies he owns and he's based in Los Angeles, so I'm available for a meeting in a couple of weeks. But yeah, it's going to be interesting to see what happens. Are they going to make it bigger? Is are they going to make this stuff more available to people? Is he going to stay? I like all these people, all these like extremely talented design driven but still commercial people in these top jobs at these smaller brands because it's making fashion interesting again. Right, there's more to talk about than the Rui show. Bokeh's toothpaste uses a fluoride alternative called nano hydroxyapatite or EnHa. It's a form of calcium that makes up the majority of your tooth enamel and dentin to help to remineralize enamel, fresh and breath and whitened teeth.

Make the switch to Bokeh for the whole family at BOKA.com. You had an amazing piece on Bottega Veneta and Matu and what he did there on Saturday night, which was, it was awesome. He's so great. It looked amazing. It was so good. So tell me what your process was as someone watching it from home because I thought your Sunday newsletter and Becky, I mean, who doesn't subscribe to your newsletter, but everybody should check out Becky's newsletter from Sunday because it was just really great. It was like a show review, but also an explanation of how to bring the ideas from the show into your real life. So I'd love to hear more about what you went through after you saw Bottega. Well, it's funny because I wrote that story about the fall show because the fall show was what's becoming available to my reader right now. But I mean, the timing was helpful. That was a happy accident of it coming at the exact same time as the new show, but obviously the spring show was a knockout. And even from afar, you could just see it and feel it and you could read the texture through the screen. And the social media surrounding it, obviously those beanbag chairs were very cute. Obviously, I love anything Richard's scary, so I thought that was very cute. Yes. But it's his moment. It's his moment right now. You can see his influence absolutely everywhere. And as I was looking through the fall collections and looking through just fall clothing out in the world, you can see the Bottega effect on everything, the colors, the proportions, the textures, how it's all getting put together. It's inescapable. And it makes me so happy because it's interesting fashion. So it's not a conversation about basics. It's not a conversation about forever pieces, which obviously these are expensive things. You would hope you keep them for a while. But it's really a conversation about what's interesting now and how to play with things now. It doesn't feel any, there's no referential points of history in bringing back classic styles. And that feels so refreshing and hard to do these days. Yeah, there's something. I don't want to say innocent about what he does, but or not. It's not naive, but there is something innocent about how he approaches fashion in the Richard Scary thing. I have mixed feelings about Richard Scary personally, but I love every time every one of his shows, I think of Working Girl. And I think it's because, of course, like the big hair and the big shoulders and all that. But it's also something about like, there's an optimism to what he does of like, my life is just starting. And that's sort of how it feels like he's just starting. And it's very easy to compare what he's doing at Bottega with what Jonathan Anderson does at Loewe, because they, I mean, I guess they're around the same size at this point. And also they're both like young and cool and the kind of people who shop one probably shop the other. But the thing that I think people really forget is that Jonathan's been doing this for 10 years. So it took a while, like we were all on the Loewe bandwagon from the beginning, but it took a while for the customer to really get on it. And now Loewe handbags are like, often it stores the number one selling bag. And I think it was just, it was a great show. So lots of silhouettes and ideas that real people will want to wear, but also more than that, it's so nice to go to a show and not just be about product. Like there's a lot of great product that people will want, but I did, I did the Scrum backstage, which I do very few, I think I did four in Milan, and maybe I'll do, I don't know, five in Paris or something like that, just because they make me very stressed out and uncomfortable. And also you can never hear anything. Some of them are worth it. Like Prada is worth going to to hear Mrs. Prada and Raf and, and I could hear them this time, which was awesome. But his Scrum is very interesting. Like I, I, they let me in and I went backstage to get in it. And I didn't even see them because he's so, it's so calm. I was like asking the models where the journalists were and they were right. And you just couldn't tell cause, and he did something that's really interesting. He made an effort to make eye contact with every single one of us, which like usually it's really one person and the designer or two people and the designer talking because like the more senior people like Tim Blanks, Vanessa Friedman, end up talking a lot and Kathy Horan, if she goes backstage. But at this show, it was really a mix and he took extra time with us. Like a lot of times they'll cut them off and which is understandable. I mean, it's just the most stressful thing in the world to have to you just, you just put on this big show, your whole livelihood, all your energy and creative effort and all that stuff. And then you have to talk to a bunch of annoying people who are going to ask you mostly stupid questions. But he was just such a great communicator and it helped me understand what he was trying to do. But also made me just love the collection even more and the materials. It was a great moment and it's nice that it's like the last really big show of the week because it's such a positive way to end things. Right. I mean, did he say anything surprising? You know, he said, it was essentially about like growing up and some of it was like first day of school or they're the gray dress he called the first interview dress, which I loved. And they like, again, that's sort of the working girl thing. That's what it reminds me of. And also that just that idea of like, let me see, I can just pull up my notes and tell you because I actually wrote a lot down that day. Little children dressed up like grownups, but like also the Italian idea of sartorial first day of school. Oh, Frankenstein beauty. So there were some looks where like the proportions, it would be a short leg and a long leg, that type of thing. He said the last collection was like more introspective and more thinking about like what was happening in the world and this was more personal. The raffia, it was like wigs coming of age. And then the dress that had the little matches dangling from it. It's a dangerous game. So it was all about like childhood, but also like school drop off and normal life and just like getting through your life. So this is my point that he's so good because those references are not so literal and in your face in a way that you saw in a few other collections in Milan this season that you're just like, it's still really interesting clothes. But then you look at like the celebrity front row and everyone looks amazing in those clothes. Like people don't look like they're in costumes. Everyone looked pretty good who was there and being dressed for the show and he's just doing something right. He really is. What a pleasure. It's funny, Julianne Moore, who is a Bottega ambassador and seems like the nicest person alive was at the show, of course, with Acehap Rocky, who looked adorable. He's just so cute. But she posted about it and I actually quoted her in my piece because it was so good. What did she say? I wonder if they cut it out. Let's see. Oh no, they kept it deeply felt romantic and human. And you know what? She's right. And the thing is like now it's up to the people who work at that company to merchandise this stuff to sell well. And of course they will, but like he's doing the work. It was lovely. I had a great time and it's always nice to sort of, Prada's not the first show, but it's like the first big, big show. Fendi was so early this season. I did not go. I was not there, but it was Tuesday afternoon. I think a lot of people just weren't in town yet. I didn't get in town until Wednesday, but Prada is really the first big show of Milan. And then Bottega is the last big show and it's a really nice sort of book. And when I went to Dover Street Market today, they were merchandise together. And it's like a nice thing. I definitely love going to Milan. It's very fun. Yeah, I love it. We're going to talk more about Gucci, which is, is the big topic of the week, but I wanted to ask you what you're excited about in Paris, like the obvious things, the row, all that stuff, the row, the row, the row. Also the row store. I know I'm so excited. I think I'm going to try to go tomorrow. Yeah, it looks so beautiful. The photo looks gorgeous. But I'm curious what you are looking out for. Valentino is sort of the big debut. Alessandro McKaylee. Yep, very excited about that. Can't wait for that. What else are you going to be checking out on Vogue Runway or Tag Walk? Tag Walk. Valentino for sure, because the resort pictures were so just scrumptious. Valentino, I guess there's the usuals and the mew mew. The row, Louvre, and then I guess one of the best shows last season was Undercover. So that'll be fun to see the evolution of that. I think that for some reason I think they might not be doing a show. No, they moved it because I, for a minute was going to be going to Paris, but then my schedule got just too chaotic and I had to cancel and it's just moved later. Oh, I think you're right. I think it's on Sunday maybe or something or? Yeah. Or something or? Because I was like, oh, amazing. I'm going to be in town for Undercover. And then just kidding. Maybe I didn't request it because I don't see it on my calendar. And I, yeah, that show was so incredible last year. So I will message the EMC Paris people immediately and get that sorted. And what else? Kiko, how do you pronounce the last name? Constanova. Sounds right. So hype people tell me what I'm saying wrong, but they do a women's show after meet and meet you. So we're right before, right after. Right before. I've always wanted to go, like I wanted to go for the past couple of seasons and I hadn't. So I was planning on, that was one of the new ones that was on my list to go to this season should I have been going. I would like to go also, Jacob Gallagher's a big fan and they're so sweet. I mean, I think that's why Jacob's always talking about it. Always talking. And I'll go. Kiko, Kiko, Kiko. Yeah. Okay. I will check it out. Dover Street Market here is awesome. Yeah. Last, my last year, I spent a lot of money at Dover Street. I just went in just to see the store and I left a very, very large shopping bag. That's great. That's great. Yeah. I, I'm excited to see Marie Adams Leonard who, do you know this brand? She's Belgian. I think she worked for Demna for a while. She was in the LVMH prize. I'm a huge fan. I, I bought a skirt. Do you remember that like gray pencil skirt I bought that I was like, it's a little, it looks good, but it feels a little too tight. I showed it to you. Yeah, look at it. I love it. It's like very patrician, but a little weird. It's long. Yeah. I'm going to go see that tomorrow. I'm going to try to mix it up. I'm excited for that one. I'm excited for the same. I'm excited for Loewe. I'm excited for the Margaret Howell presentation. Always excited for that. I mean, you know what's so fun is the Loewe, Reesy, because that's stuff you just have to like touch and get into. I agree. When, so that's like, there's very few exciting Reeses and I will say that is a very exciting thing. I agree. I didn't go to the Prada Reesy this time and I don't know if they just didn't ask for me to go, or if people who do my tickets, EMC Paris, wonderful, give me a discount for sending people to you. I don't know if they just told them no, because I don't normally do them, but I love going to the Prada one. Yeah, that's a great one. Also, the Prada one, just to see what they're serving on the little trays of like perfectly peeled oranges. Same. I like to go to the Hermes one because there's always really good food. I'm obviously excited for Hermes, huge Nadezh fan. I really like Hermes spring shows because they get away from like leather in every garment. I always find spring to be like my favorite Hermes season, so that's going to be great, I'm sure. Totally. And it'll also be really interesting to see Chanel because no person there. And I've heard from a couple people who work with them or connected to them in different ways or are just speculating and everybody's saying that like it's a real vault there, which makes that word is used by like five different people talking to me about it, which makes everyone thinks that they're pretty close or they've decided. So it'll be an interesting thing to see the studio collection. I bet it'll be fabulous. Also, secretly studio collections are sometimes the best collections. The best. Remember the Gucci one? No, the Dior one, like between Raph and Maria Grazia. It's still like one of my most beautiful collection. Everyone go back and look at that show is like angelic. We love Raph and Maria Grazia, but that collection. Both. G-boy, was that designed by Serge and Lucy Meyer? I think so. So I love Serge. Serge has a handbag line and shoe brand that I'm going to go see next week. Really quickly, can we just rewind to Jill Sander and Luke and Lucy Meyer? It was interesting. I wonder what's going on there. It totally changed. Yeah, unexpected going through this show even digitally. I was like, oh, that's not the same. I mean, some of it is, it does feel like them, but then the prints at the end, I don't, it was definitely different, but there, I will say going through it. I was like, oh my God, there are so many tops. Someone is listening. I'm saying all women want our tops. And there was a lot of pieces actually that to work with. Yeah, I think I wrote that the thing I noticed, and they were, they're one of those brands that you could feel the Phoebe influence, the Selene influence, not in a bad way. Like it's just the way there are a few designers who sort of shape what everyone else does. And I thought this collection, I was like, oh, you could feel it again, like because Phoebe Philo is so different. Yeah, and it was exciting. And the thing is, I need to write this at some point, but just that orally leather jacket that I bought that you encouraged me to buy. Aren't you happy I made you buy that? Oh my God, it's really the best thing. I can't buy anything on this trip though, because I bought that. That's fine. That's the perfect jacket. It was worth it. But the interesting thing is so many people were like, is that Phoebe? It doesn't have the blouson on the bottom or anything. Like it doesn't have the peplum on the bottom. It's a blouson, but it doesn't have the peplum. But you can really feel her influence. And it took a year, but you can really feel it in the shows, but it really in the way people are dressing, which is very exciting. Totally true.

This isn't really a rumor of the week because it's not a rumor. I don't know what's going on there. And anyone who says that they do, I think is fully lying. The only thing that I know and what I wrote in Line Sheet on Monday was that the LACMA Art and Film Gala, which happens November 2nd, the invites went out and Sabado DeSarno's name is on it. So there has been all this speculation that he's going to leave right after the show. I don't think that's happening. And whether or not they made a decision of him staying or going, I don't know. I think it could be that they still are going to wait until the end of the year to see how the clothes are actually in the stores now. So let's see. They have earnings October 24th. Let's see how the earnings are. If sales have started to pick up, he could be there for another five years. It is totally possible. All that said, I don't think the industry sentiment, like what did you think about the collection from your vantage point? The collection that Sabado DeSarno showed for Gucci on Friday, September, whatever. This most recent collection. It was clothes. I just felt like it was clothes. It was, I've read a few reviews that are like a lot of what's going on there as a pressure cooker and not everything is necessarily his fault, but it did just feel a bit like a pressure cooker to produce clothes and it didn't feel like the spirit. You could feel the spirit in Bottega and Bali and I just didn't feel that. Obviously, I wasn't there, so it's not fair for me to say, but I didn't feel it the same. And I didn't feel that the clothes felt very early odds to me. And I feel like that was a theme throughout New York and Milan and references and self-references. But for me as a consumer, it didn't spark the joy that I need to open my wallet. Yeah, I think all of that can be true at the same time. It is a situation where I talked to someone who's very close to the company last week about it and they said, look, like the ingredients were there for him to succeed, but he's a first time creative director. And he also, it was so complicated. The CEO left two months after, got fired two months after he got there. Other people left immediately. There were all these different people working there, had been there for 20 years, and then people who were there for 10 years, and then people who just arrived. There were people doing the same jobs. There were the marketing jobs were all doubled up. It was very complicated. And so they have a new CEO, this deputy CEO, they're trying to reorganize it. But Stefano Cantino really only arrived in the middle of the year. So it's like, there's no time for it to all work. But at all of that said, if the industry doesn't like it and people aren't like, this is hot shit, it's not hot shit. And so they might have to start over again. From my perspective, I'd say I haven't been bullish on him, but I get what he's trying to do since the beginning. And I do think the idea was right. Cute little dresses for going out and parting and having a good time, that can be a brand. It's just the issue was, and also amazing accessories. The issue was that none of it was defined enough. Like the marketing is defined and some of it was really good, but then that didn't really work with the clothes. And then the clothes didn't work. Nothing worked together. It didn't feel really clear. And I thought Marie Shea is new stylist. I thought she was good. And I thought it was a better fit than him and Alistair McKim. Like Alistair McKim, you can see his imprint on collections with Gucci, you never could. And so I think Marie Shea is better for him of the kind of look he wants. I got the feeling there were people who were really down on it that this collection, they were like, okay, this is better. But then there were other people who were kind of like, oh, this was the worst one yet. So my feeling was like it looked like more of a thought than it had previously. Like the last collection, yeah, like the resort collection I thought was really pretty, but it felt like really referencing a bunch of other brands and also just like didn't really all go together. Whereas this felt like it went together. I actually disagree. I thought resort felt more like you can see that person more than this. Interesting. No, sorry. I felt no, I don't, I mean, that's the point of this. I don't know if it's like, that's the thing. Like who is that person? And when you're at the show, what I will say is like, everybody wears a head to toe in the, in not even just in the front row, and you can see them and you're like, okay, I get it. It's like a leather jacket. It's these sling backs. It's all cute. Like it's cute, fun clothes for going out and partying. And there is a customer for that, but the thing is it needs to all work together. And I just don't think it all works together. And so who knows? We really don't know, but it's not, the problem is like, you want there to be a turning point and there was, it wasn't like, bam, maybe the earnings will come back and it'll be like, this was a hit, this past quarter, blah, blah, blah. And then it will turn everybody's minds. But I don't think that's going to be the case. Yeah. It, when I was thinking about this call and we were kind of talking about Nike too, it kind of, it feels the same to me in a way that it's sort of like, how big do you need this business to be before like the spark? Like, you know, you need the creative and you need the business. And like, at what point are you just pushing the business so hard that the creative like suffocates? And that sort of feels similar to me there, even though they're obviously very different issues. But it just sort of felt like, how big did you need this business to be that like, you had to start over and just all felt that kind of feels sad to me in terms of the business of it. Feels like it's crushing the creativity. Yes. And I think, but the thing is, and that is an argument to bring in someone new, like, if it was some, if, if there was a new designer that was someone people are really obsessed with, like, you know, Jonathan Anderson, Koff Koff, like people would be excited. The market would be, Lucas Soka would be excited. It would create a lot of morale. Like, this is not, this is not totally apples to apples, but thinking about what just happened at Nike, which we were going to talk about earlier, but we can talk about now where basically the CEO, this guy, John Donahoe had come in, he was a career CEO, had the like, perfect CV to be the CEO best friends with Phil Knight, one of the founders of Nike. I don't know if he's the founder. I think he was one of one of the founders played by Ben Affleck in the movie air, which was also directed by Ben Affleck. Love, love that movie. But anyway, this guy comes in, he thinks he knows what to do because he's just like doing what a CEO would do. He changes the business totally. The company culture was all already shifting. They had gone through a lot of like workplace culture stuff that was serious, like not like business insider serious, but New York Times serious. And the company is just so giant and, and they had all these challenges. He comes in, he removes a lot of people, a lot of like career executives, quote unquote, retire. He does all the stuff that you can listen to many podcasts about this, but the big thing is that he pulls out of a lot of multi-brand retail where he shouldn't have. He thinks everybody's going to go to Nike.com. They don't. He ends up like getting into a crazy discount cycle. All this stuff needs to be unwound now. And he was already doing it, but you know, activist investors are circling. All of that stuff. And then suddenly, bam, they decided to get rid of him. And I'm, again, they say he was, he is retiring, but obviously they decided that he needed to go for the sake of the business. They bring back this guy, Elliot Hill, who retired in 2020, Nike careerist. He is known as being extremely charismatic. Everybody's obsessed with him. There was a standing ovation when the email went out of people clapping and standing. So happy that Elliot's coming. But the problem is, so like that boosted the Nike stock and all that stuff, but still, and so that may help turn that company around. If you can fix the morale, you, it doesn't fix the problem, but at least it gets people like all on the same page working towards the same goal. Cause the issue is if morale is bad, people don't want to help each other out. It's like that rising tide lifts all boats thing. It's not going to be easy for Elliot at all, but it's a good start. Yeah. I mean, we'll see. I want Nike to be good. So I was asking my husband about this cause he's like a major Nike guy. And he hasn't been buying a lot of sneakers and I'm like, what gifts? Like why hadn't you been? So I was like, well, what about you? Why not you? And he's like, well, you know, I'm not into collecting hypey sneakers and like, you know, I like some retro stuff, but not everything. And there's no, the innovation's gone. He's like, remember the joy rides I was liking the joy rides. I was like, oh, I forgot about the joy ride, but sort of felt like there's no, the newness wasn't there. So that was interesting. Yeah. A friend of mine said that if you go stand in the line at Courage Bagels, which is like the cool bagel place in LA, which why would anyone ever stand in line for these bagels? They're fine. I had them during the pandemic. People in LA eat bagels? Yeah. People in LA eat. It's just like a very particular LA. You'd be surprised how much crap people in the Hollywood eat. Like people who work behind the scenes in Hollywood have very poor diets. I'll just put it that way. I've been shocked at the kind of food that people who are not actors or in front of the camera eat. It's like, where have you been living for the last 30 years? It's like some very interesting eating in the center of the grocery aisle, not on the edges or whatever. Lots of processed food. Anyway, yeah, there's this bagel place that's near Squirrel and there's this long line. The bagels are light and flat, whatever. I had them once. They're very good. I didn't think they put enough ingredients on the top for as intense as the experiences. But now the line is like two and a half hours long. So people go at like 6 a.m. Nicole Carrey's husband, Jacob Soboroff, goes at like 7 a.m. on Saturday morning and always posts. He's like him and the kid go or whatever. I haven't been because I'll go someday. But you really have to get there at like 6 for not to be hell. I ate them once when there wasn't a line like that. Anyway, the sneakers. This person was like, you don't see any nikes. And that I think is a good, they need to be in the culture. So I think any of these companies, when a company is in crisis, you have to think about the less tangible things. Yes. And that's part of the spirit. That's part of the innovation to be able to have your head on straight, to think properly of like what is the culture that we want to be a part of and how do we infiltrate that? Like you have to be a bit clever and have the headspace to think about that. Yes, I 100% agree. And if you would like to hire Becky to consult on your issues, she's available. I'm serious. This was fun. I'm sure we'll talk soon. Any last thoughts on as we go into the Paris shows? What's the first show? Saint Laurent? No, Dior. Oh, Dior. Yeah, I knew that. Okay. When? Tomorrow? Yep. Are you buying anything before then? No, you got your leather jacket. I'm not buying anything. I wanted to buy something from Bali, but they don't have a store here. So I'm going to just wait. I'll buy something in New York maybe. Yeah, I still need to go to the New York store. I haven't been here. Yeah, maybe we can go together when I'm there in October. I think it's in the Meatpacking District. Oh, interesting. I should know this as their number one fan. I should know this. We'll go on a little tour. Yeah. Sounds great. We'll have a great Paris.
