And today with me on the show is Jesse Lee, founder of Basic Space and Proprietor of Design Miami. We're discussing everything from the allure of a purvey gas station to the allure of Demna Gucci. Before we get going, I wanted to remind you that if you like this podcast, you'll definitely love Puck where I send an email called Line Sheet. If you're a fashion person, you get that reference.

Busy one as usual over here at Puck and specifically Line Sheet. I'm sure you've all heard that Wednesday was Liberation Day. I tried to cover the confusing and murky situation around the tariffs in a way that would actually be interesting and perhaps helpful to readers. Essentially, what I'm understanding is they're still going to have to engage these companies in Europe and these companies that deal with manufacturing and everyone needs to work together because everyone needs to make money. Here's hoping as they try to negotiate over the next month that something works out. The reality is everybody's going to lose a bunch of money and everybody needs to make a lot of money. Let's just hope they can work it out. If not, I'll see you in two years. I also have a bigger story about the crisis of LVMH and caring that's not really about tariffs, it's stuff we've covered before, but extremely important and all coming to a head at the moment. I also get into Radhika Jones' departure from Vanity Fair. Everyone wants to know who the next editor of Vanity Fair is going to be. I got a lot of writings from Mel Atenberg. I didn't mention him on my Thursday email, but if you check out Fridays, there will be an addition. A lot of people wrote it. I just personally think Mel makes too much money. The amount of money they pay someone in one year, I assume he makes on one campaign and if you do that job, you can't do those other jobs. We'll see. Who knows? Stella Bugby was also a favorite, is also a favorite of mine. Many people mentioned Sarah Moonves. I didn't mention her because I believe she will be and should be the next editor of Vogue. I will also mention this on Friday. If you want to read up, check out Thursday, check out Friday, read Line Sheet for way more intel. Let's get going with Jesse, who texted me this morning to tell me that he sold the most expensive piece at Design Space LA, this event where we had this conversation this past weekend. Jesse is the founder of Basic Space. He also owns Design Miami through his company. Design Space LA is blending of the two. It was a fair, a design fair, but you could buy pretty much everything. He said that they sold a Prueve gas station, which pretty wild. I guess I would buy one if I could. Let's get going. I hope you enjoy this conversation. It was our first live event. I hope we can do many more. If you would like to host one or pay for one, you know where to find me. Hi, everyone. Welcome to Fashion People. First time live pod. First time live pod. I'm Lauren Sherman. I am the fashion correspondent at Puck and host of our fashion podcast, Fashion People. This is Jesse Lee, the reason we're here today. Thanks for coming. Thanks for having me. I've never done a live podcast before, so just bear with us. Especially not in front of 5,000 people. Yes, so many people. This is a good testing ground. This is a big theater, by the way. I've been to a screening in this theater. What did you see? I saw challengers here. It was cool. It was like, I don't go to a lot of those kinds of things, but I did go to a screening of challengers. Yeah, because there's a lot of fashion. Yeah, I forget how I got. I think I did ask the Loewe people to hook it up. I can't really remember. I went with Hillary Kerr. Do you know her? She's like in the East Side School mix. So we start every Friday episode. This is going to run next Friday with the question, what did you have for breakfast? Some of the people in here already know the answer, which is nothing. I don't eat breakfast. Do you never eat breakfast? On weekends, I do. So I'll splurge on Saturday, Sunday, but I have a reason. Monday through Friday, I just drink coffee because I learned years ago, even when I have a salad for lunch, I get tired and I need a second iced coffee, but it still doesn't work as much as, I don't know, not eating. So when is the first time you eat during the day? Five o'clock. Whoa, I thought you said you don't eat breakfast, but you don't eat breakfast or lunch. Oh yeah, so I forgot to say that. So I start with coffee, but I only need one coffee for the whole day. Okay. And then, well, when I'm traveling, I maybe eat dinner even later, but in LA, as you know too, we all eat early. Five thirty. Yeah, so I do. But I'll literally eat anything and everything in like three portions. Okay, so you eat a very large meal. Yeah. And then I'll have glass of wine or something. Sometimes I want to call this section of the podcast Eating Disorder Corner. Mine's more for productivity though. Look, I know a lot of people who say they call it intermittent fasting, I guess, but I was doing that before it was called that. Okay. Anyway, how did you end up in LA? So I actually flipped a coin after college. Either in New York or LA, I grew up mostly in Chicago, went to school out there and at the time I wanted to be in the music industry and essentially picked LA because of the weather. Didn't know anyone and just drove west. I feel like Los Angeles could be very isolating in your twenties because it's not like you can't just go out to a bar, you can't go walk around, you don't run into people as much. No, I actually moved to LA literally at the height of entourage era and you just met. Were you in an entourage? But me and my friends would, I mean, at the time I went out every night. So that's how I know some of these guys, Mark the Cobra Snake, Glengerman, taking photos of us. We were all out every night. Wasn't Mark in New York at that time now? No, Mark was definitely in LA in Hollywood. Where's Mark? Can't see him. No. So like mid to late 2000s, I would say was like peak LA nightlife. So Monday through Sunday. Oh yeah, that was when all those like clubs that ended up being on reality television shows were big. Hollywood back then was completely different and you can get a mix of everything. So if you wanted to go to cool Indie Rock, you know, hipster party on Tuesday at Cine Space or LAX on Sundays or like DJ and Mark Ronson, all that stuff. But then you can still do the, you know, bottle service hip hop clubs on the weekends. And yeah, some of the friends that I have, even to this day, used to be in that industry. So what did you do when you moved out here? Did you try to get a job in music? I try to get a job at every record label, none of them answered my email. So I had to apply for an internship, didn't get paid, worked at retail. Actually, the first and only time I worked retail, but Where'd you work? I never share the story, but I'll actually share it with you. So first two places I tried to get a job at on the promenade, declined, which I'll get back to in a second. One was Urban Outfitters, the other one was Puma. Urban was hard to get a job. I tried to get a job there in college and it was really difficult. And they had a, there was a crazy, like screening to make sure you never did any drugs. So if you got that far, it was like, have you ever smoked weed? And I was like, what, what do you say? That's how I didn't get the Puma job. I think it's true. They were, they were really conservative. But French connection hired me. Wow. Remember FC UK? Yes. So I was on the floor selling for a few months, but crazy enough, five years later, when I started my own creative agency, both Puma and Urban Outfitters became clients. So store manager can kiss my. So five years in, you started your own creative agency. What did you went from being a shop boy at FC UK to owning a creative agency? What happened? Yeah. So I went out every night and part of the reason why I went out every night wasn't just like drinking, have fun. Although I did plenty of that. It was to like meet people. So you said, right, was an LA, maybe a lonely place or whatever. I didn't know a single person. So I'd go out every night to meet. It sounds really cliche, but quote, unquote, network. And within like two years, networking, before it was called even networking though. Well, the funny thing is, so I was just an intern and in the mail room eventually, and then became someone's assistant all pretty quickly within a year. I would pick up DJs and musicians from the airport, do favors for them, which again, some I shouldn't have to be doing, but I never said no. And I was all over town. And within a couple of years, a lot of my friends thought that I was from LA because they'd just seen me on the belt. Jason Stewart, mutual friend, he was working the door at Sinnespace back then. I really don't, I barely know what Sinnespace is, but it sounds very cool. It's where like the Indy Rock hipster scene started. Okay. You know, like the Steve Aoki, Frankie Chan, Mark the Cobra Snake, that whole era. So you're interning at a music. Oh yeah. So I'll fast forward. Basically, within a couple of years, I moved up relatively quickly, I guess. At the time, it felt like I was stuck. But again, I just kept showing up. There's a story like I'd call into the office and my boss would be, he would like pick up the phone and put it out and go, Jesse's calling again, does anyone need him to come in and do anything for you? So that was my motto. And then so went from internship to mail room getting like 10, 15 an hour, was an assistant for a couple of months, learned how to, you know, work every day without getting paid much. And where was this? This was a talent management company that managed like Crystal Method and like Henry Rollins. So it doesn't exist. I don't think so. But so just doing that. And then the first big break was I worked at this magazine called Herb URB. It was Indy Music Mag, Raymond Roker. And the way I got that job too was I was stalking him on email. I would email him at like 2am asking for a job because I grew up reading the magazine when I was in college. I was really I was DJing when I was younger too. So he gave me a job that I wasn't qualified for. I was like 24, 25. And I was a marketing manager first time with a business, first time with a business card. And it was like the biggest accomplishment. So it didn't matter how little I was getting paid. So I was there for about a year and a half. And then I'd always wanted to start my own company because in college I was DJing and throwing club nights and parties. So I knew that at some point I wanted to do my own thing. And of course, my parents were like, don't do it. Why don't you like get a job and keep moving on up and learn more. And my logic was, if I don't do this in my 20s, and if I'm in my 30s or 40s and married with kids, it's going to be harder to do it. So I just took a leap of faith. It also happened to be in the late 2000s when there were that many great jobs available after the great recession or whatever. So yeah, I relaunched my blog called Dub Frequency. Started throwing parties at the standard, doing events at South by Southwest, Coachella, Fashion Week, Arpozl Miami, and those sponsors became clients. So then that's how DFM, and you know, some of the people that also worked with me at DFM. So that was like between 2009 and like 2018, 19. So what kind of work did you do for them? Like what you, it was a creative agency, but that can mean a million different things. So what was your special? So the first few years was a lot of events because brands would sponsor our events at South by Southwest or Coachella. So brands that you know well, like we've done parties with opening ceremony, Teva with FK twigs, Coachella before, you know, she became famous. And a lot of the brands then started coming to us and saying, well, why don't you do events for us? And then we were also making content on YouTube and like MySpaceDays and all that stuff, right? Record labels. And so we were doing early version of influencer marketing before it was called that. So we would have talent and some are still, you know, partners of ours on basic space, but we would help discover them, so to speak. So a lot of the DJs and musicians would play our parties for free. And then next year they're playing Coachella or on the fashion side, we helped launch V files, remember V files, Chilean Kuei. So we did fashion week parties with them. And then opening ceremony, obviously Carol actually, Carol Lim's an early investor of basic space. So I used to shop at OC all the time. That's where I bought my first like Alexander Wang or Martin Rose. And then started working with bigger brands, whether it's like Nike, Calvin Klein, Gucci, kind of on the fashion side, and then like Spotify, Square, Cash App on the tech. So when you first launched the agency and you started working with fashion brands, what was your impression of the fashion industry? Because it changed dramatically in the 10 years that you were operating the agency. So I think what was cool back then, by the way, my daughter asked that I give her a shout out for her, her name's Izzy and her friend, the devil booth outside. Check her booth out. It's really cool. It's jewelry, right? Yeah, homemade for her brother. But you know, the feeling of fashion 10 years ago, and I know we're going to come back to the design thing in a second. Yeah. But it just felt so like it's like subversive and cool. And there was a mix of luxury felt unattainable, you know, in your 20s, like having a Louis Vuitton wallet or Gucci wallet was like belt was an accomplishment. Yeah. And then you would mix that with, you know, skate, streetwear, sneakers, all that stuff. And then, you know, going back to LA nightlife, the cool thing about LA in New York back then too, was you can go to the most exclusive clubs, but if you look cool, like they let you in. But if you look like a douchebag and you just have money, they wouldn't let you in. And it wasn't like that in Chicago, like you can't even wear hats to clubs in Chicago. They make you, if I dress like this and walk to a fancy club in Chicago, they wouldn't let me in. But in New York and LA, if you dress a certain way or they think you're cool or you have style, they let you in. And fashion was a big part of that. So for me, it just felt very, yeah, like new. And you can kind of combine the high low. And I think that proved, you know, paved a way for a lot of those people from that generation to become creative directors of luxury fashion houses and, you know, all that. Yeah, I'm Virgil. Yeah. I mean, Virgil, we know him from, yeah, he's the DJ of parties. And a lot of people like that, you know, Jerry Lorenzo also promoted club nights in LA when I first moved here. A lot of people, you know, came from that era. Why do you think that world is, was a sort of, I don't want to say factory, but a resource for the fashion industry during that period, because like music and fashion just interact no matter what. And music became the kind of core of influence during that period. And so all these people were like rapping about brands and they became more like, what do you think the through line? Yeah. Yeah. So if I take it back to even when I was in college, the person that kind of started all in my opinion was Pharrell Williams back then. So imagine 2025 years ago, right before Kanye Pharrell was the first guy with like, you know, Neptune's at any RD and wearing kind of the skate clothes and, you know, the high low mix. I even had Chanel earrings like 20 years ago. Because of Pharrell. Well, no, I think I had him before he ever wore Chanel, but I'm just saying Pharrell was influenced by just by the way, my wife and my daughter have those as record. I have these two double C Chanel earrings that I used to wear in my early 20s. But point being though, Pharrell was kind of everyone's style God. Yeah. And then, you know, I know it's a controversial person, but Kanye came along and took it to a whole other level. And, you know, whether you like him as a person or not, like that was the major inflection point, right? Music to fashion culture. And all those guys that you mentioned and people you know, well, right at one point or another worked with Kanye. Do you think there's something about, I always make this reference, I've probably written this like 15 times, but in the like 1990s, 2000s, and prior to that too, the sort of queuing up culture was all about waiting for an album to drop. So it was like, I think Tuesday nights. Yeah. Tuesday was the release day. Was the release date. So maybe people would go on Monday night and at midnight on or 12, 01 a.m. on Tuesday, they would get there the album. And then it turned in the last decade or in the 2010s into people waiting in line for off-white and Supreme and all of that. Do you think that those two things are interconnected? I actually never thought about that, but the drop model does sound familiar to what the music drop model is. I think Supreme's was Wednesday, I want to say, when they would drop Thursday. Yeah. So yeah, perhaps, but actually, if you think about it, early streetwear brands from the 2000 era had the drop model. And as you know, very well, again, like luxury fashion then started kind of following suit. And then we'll, I'm sure, talk about how that's also now the other direction now. It's kind of swinging back a different way. But yeah, that's probably there's, there might be some relevance to that.

Well, you mentioned earlier this idea of owning a Louis Vuitton wallet was like an accomplishment. Something changed in around 2018, 2019, I'd say that maybe I think it had to do with the rise of resale. It became more common to own that kind of stuff that like you would put a ton of your income towards getting that wallet or pair of sneakers or whatever, or buying them second hand or buying a pair on the first drop and reselling them for more money and making income off of it. It just became like not as rarefied to own luxury goods by the end of the 2010s. Was that something when you launched basic space, which you should explain what it is? Was that something you were thinking about? Yeah, I mean, you know, my biggest source of inspiration or references for that matter are people close to me, whether it's my wife, friends, people I work with. And, you know, I started seeing people buy like, quote unquote, cool people buy more vintage, right? And, but part of it, I think is to make it even more simple, just like any other trend, so to speak. I mean, nothing lasts forever, right? So I think with luxury fashion, it just got to a point where it's, you know, like you said, everybody had it or too many people made it to, you know, I guess like for the lack of a better word, it's everywhere, you know? Yeah. And then like what happens is just like in other, you know, trends, people like kind of get into the next thing, right? So what's the next thing? So yeah, like it's, I think, all about discovery and sense of style, and people started just kind of looking into other places. So what is basic space? Why did you decide to launch it? And how did it get you to the point where you're like hosting this fair on a Saturday in Los Angeles? So it just came out of actually, you know, what we just talked about. I knew a lot of creatives that weren't quote unquote, influencers in a traditional way of like YouTube, video, and Instagram, like influencer types. Yet those are the ones I felt like were really setting trends. And so why not be able to pick those people, their friends of ours anyway, and have them sell directly to consumer. Now, we started with mostly vintage fashion in the beginning because that was the easiest way to get supply. And a lot of my friends and some of the people you know, they weren't selling on other existing resell platforms because they felt like that it was too common for them to or didn't seem cool to them to do that. But with us, they're selling next to their friends. A lot of them have their own brands. And then we started selling exclusive new products and some of them got into design. And that's how the Virgil Vitra thing, you know, four years ago. And then, yeah, so to me, it's a curated marketplace, but also the term curated gets really, you know, thrown around a lot. And it was for us, it's kind of like invite only to sell. And it's our friends and friends of friends selling. And it's kind of expanded into now more design and art. I mean, at one point, we were even selling NFTs. We had the controversial, I don't know if you remember the baby Birkenbeck NFT. I vaguely remember this. I do remember meeting you via phone during COVID. And I think it was around the launch of the Virgil Vitra thing. So can you explain what that was? Because I think it ties into what we're doing here this weekend. So it was the first COVID like winter and to give credit or credits to like both Virgil and Vitra, I think they were just looking for an alternative way to release a product outside of their usual channels. So our idea was pretty simple because we were we were only like three months old at the time. We did a pop up in Miami and our concept was IRL to URL shopping. So we live streamed the experience had one of our mutual friends, Pedro, who's also part of this DJ and Virgil did the set design. And we released it the next day like it's live, it was actually pre recorded. And then the chair, the lamp and the brick, we sold out in a couple of days on basic space. And it kind of gave us the blueprint for what we're doing now on a much larger scale. It's so crazy to think that Virgil is doing that on top of everything else he was doing. And just everything he was going through obviously in his life. It's and and when you think about him, he was a trained industrial designer. So what is happening now in the culture, which you've become sort of the like poster child of this design is the new luxury idea. It's so much of it is connected to him and like the culture he built around his yeah, I mean, I think even working together on that project, you saw how fast and frequent the emails and messages come across our teams. And I always remember because I'll tell I would tell my own team and like, pay attention to even the the lines and the spacing in the deck. Because like I care about those things too. So, you know, it's best if you don't make spelling errors. You're always kind, you know, all the emails are very positive. It's never like, you know, I'm sure we've all dealt with a lot of people where their emails are curt and not nice or not cordial, but him and his team are always very gracious. And that's why we all like collectively work love working together. But yeah, Virgil was ahead of his time or you know, in terms of doing design, I mean, he had done collaborations with some of the the highest like the coolest design galleries, one of them, or a couple of them work with us at Design Miami, whether it's Gallery Creo, Carpenter's Workshop, another mutual friend of ours, Francois Lafonore, has the Pruevet gas station here outside. And so Virgil was doing design even back then. And I firmly believe that if he were still with us, he'd be doing a lot more design hospitality and all that stuff. Yeah. So when did you start to see this shift in the in consumer behavior? Obviously during the pandemic, people were spending a lot of money on their homes, but they were also buying a lot of luxury goods, like a ton. For a lot of these brands, 2022 was their best year ever in the US in particular. So they were people were still buying clothes, even though they really didn't have anywhere to wear them. But when did you start to notice that there was a sort of the priority was moving away from having like another bag and instead buying like a chair or whatever? You nailed it 2022. Because I think if you look at all the financial reports and stock prices and stuff, right, those are market highs. And you just, I mean, it just became again, like too overexposed. So it's not even about money or I think accessibility, because that gets thrown around a lot too, even with collectible design. But people just want something new that's cool. So design became the next thing because there's some collectability, you know, element to it. It requires a bit more studying and having a certain like eye and taste and understanding historical context as well as like what's new. And I think it gives people more, or let me say it differently, it makes it harder to kind of just like have your style, whereas like fashion became like uniform, you know, a lot of people started dressing the same where you follow a certain influencer and you used to go on Instagram, you can kind of copy and paste the look. But furniture, like even if you wanted to buy a Prove a daybed somewhere on an auction site, there's a very good chance that it's not real. So you have to understand how to look for the the authentic product, the provenance. So it kind of requires a lot more for the lack of better term again, like kind of sense of style intelligence, like ability to research. It takes a little more work. 100%. So I actually also believe in that, you know, the best mode in business is actually doing the most difficult thing, the harder thing that people can't copy. So I think that's why you see more and more people that kind of are into fashion also transitioning over into design. It's a way to stand out. It requires more work, then it's harder to replicate. Do you also feel like you you work with a lot of the luxury brands, you observe them, you're a consumer, you are around people consuming them? Do you I felt like 2022, 2023, a lot of the biggest brands, which I would call Mastiche, they would hate that. But it is like, you are selling so much at that point, that you are mass, whether or not everyone can access it is a different question. But like enough people can that it's near ubiquitous or near almost generic. It felt like to me that a lot of the bigger brands were minting money, so they weren't innovating. So innovation often happens when you You have to have constraints, right? It's like innovators dilemma. So when you're printing money and selling what works, it's hard to say screw that and move on to the next thing. But yeah, that's part of the strategy. But do you did you feel that coming out of the big brands, like they need to like shake it up, do something different? Some of them I've talked to about. And in the others though, to give credit work again, where credit's due like in some of the, you know, luxury fashion houses started getting more into design a couple of years ago, right? So, you know, one of my favorite brands that I'm sure you too, you know, like Botega, Botega Veneta with, you know, Leo, the CEO is super smart. He's very much into like design history and a lot of things outside of just fashion. And obviously with Matthew Blazy during his time there, they were innovating with like a ton of Peche chair a couple of years ago to obviously the we were at the last show together. Yeah, we were seated next to each other. The last, right? Matthew Blazy. Yeah, that was the last show. We explained those chairs to people. So the last Matthew Blazy, Botega Veneta show, was that like October? Yeah, it would have been, right? Oh my God, it feels like so long ago, but it was October 2024. They made this exclusive, they call it the poofs, the Arc chair with Zonota, Italian design company. And they were all like exotic animals. What was your animal? Because they said they chose the animal for the person. I don't believe it because I don't believe it either. Maybe some of them, but not every one. Mine was like a like a yellow chick, I think. I honestly can't remember. I think mine was the bunny. Wait, the bunny's the, that's the one that everybody wanted. Jacob already had that one. Really? I honestly can't remember. I'm sure that I took photos, but I remember being like, I would have preferred this one. Do you remember what happened though? Like when you came to sit down and then someone was sitting in your seat and got rid of your name, you couldn't find your name? Someone tried to take my seat and it was, I mean, it was a perfectly lovely seat, but it wasn't the best seat in the house. Let's just say that. No, no, but no, I think you were more upset because you couldn't take a photo for Instagram without your name on it. That's true. Well, no, I never do that though. No, I'm just saying, but like, but I would know, I was just, I don't like when people take my seat at shows. For sure. Yeah. Because I would never do that. It's so, I would be so ashamed to do that. And I, I'm just like, don't do that to people. It's just so weird. I just, I find it very, when people do it, it makes me very uncomfortable. Yeah, but we got to be at the last one. It was fabulous. It was such a great show and has inspired so fashion wise has inspired so much. I think Loewe, they, they have a big, another great example. Obviously have, have really dug in and it works better, I think, with leather goods brands because they're not as like, it's not about the couture house and, and like Chanel, it'll be interesting with Matt to being there. Will he dig into design because that's really a couture house and it has so many different elements of fashion design to, to play with. Whereas like a Loewe or a Bottega, it's really about craftsmanship. So it naturally like lends itself or Hermes is the ultimate example of that. It naturally lends itself to the design world. So it's Matt to is obviously really interested in art and design. It'd be interesting to see like what he brings to the table because buying Chanel furniture maybe doesn't feel as natural as buying a piece of Bottega furniture that has like leather accents anyway. I don't know. I mean, I think there are two paths and you know, not to get controversial, but I'll just, please get controversial. So I think there's really just, just us. Yeah, just, just us. Two, two ways, right? One I think is it's not going to look the way we're talking about. So it's not that Chanel should make more furniture. Perhaps they have objects and pieces and accessories and home goods that just is like a different product. And so I don't even know what that may be, right? So I think there could be a collectible item or need for things like that. I mean, I buy things from different luxury brands of little objects that I never use. They just sit in a box. It's kind of collectible. Yeah. So that's one way. Some of them are out in the guest house, but, but then they lose value if you open the box, you know, or collectibles. I know we have not opened our, is it Enorme? Is that how you pronounce Enorme? Enorme. Oh, the phone. Yeah. You know, when John comes and speaks with Marion later, and you guys should come back for it too, is if you buy the phone and have it, him and David Kelly are going to sign it, which is going to make it work. Did we get them to sign ours? You don't want to sign, Dan? But I don't know we're going to be able to wait. We have a 515 dinner at Moza. But, but the other path, the second way though, right? So one is that if it's a luxury fashion house, I think it needs to look different of what they make and sell. The other way is going to be, go ahead. No, keep going. Well, I think the other way is going to be the next wave of luxury brands or, you know, it's going to be something completely different. Well, what is completely different? Like, what do you think that's going to look like? I mean, I'm just going to, as the guys at All-In will say, talk my books or whatever. I mean, some of our best friends that are here, a friend of mine, Charlie Vezza, like he has three design companies that are really cool. So it's Memphis, Goo from Meritalia. He and his family acquired them over the last 10 years and they're, you know, very respected Italian design companies. I believe the holding company is called Italian Radical Design Group. Memphis, as we'll talk about later, right? Tori Sotsas and big moving from the 80s. So, and that's that. Meritalia had done a collab with Guitano Pecce before he passed away. So we're selling those here. And then Goo from is the brand that Asap Rocky collaborated with for design first two years ago. And then now with us and Rocky has a booth with his brand called Homemade. So what I'm saying is there is going to be a new type of luxury brands and companies that sort of take the mind share, perhaps away from. So what does that mean for those big groups and those big brands? Like, how do they, how do you believe they should remain in like, how can they stay in the culture in a real way? I mean, I have an answer, but. Give it. I'm sure they'll still hire you to tell them. And yeah, we have a mix of investors and advisors that are kind of in that world too. But and no, I'll just be completely honest. They're going to have to invest in what we do. I mean, at the end of the day, like basic spaces, another version of a department store, it's the new Barney's, it's what opening ceremony was for me. It's what Collette was for me. And a lot of those specialty retail stores that helped introduce designers, products and trends don't exist anymore. And, you know, what we want to do with basic space and friends that we have, your 70 plus partners that showed up to sell with us. It's a mix of design, fashion and art. And I think the new way that people like, you know, our age, the old millennials down that want to shop, they don't want to go to the same traditional flagship stores or go online and just buy something like you want to experience in real life, you know, have a mix of vintage old with new exclusives. And again, we may just consume different types of products altogether. Yeah, it was interesting. I was having a conversation with a designer who knows a lot of about retail and knows a lot of the players in retail. And we were talking about Barney's. Everybody really misses Barney's. And this person was like, they'd need to just figure it out and bring it back for real, not with Saks Global, like really do it. But the issue is it's nobody, everybody wants that, but then it exists and they don't actually go and buy anything at these places. So the model needs to change because people don't really, they want a place where they can go, but they'll probably only go once every six months, maybe once a year. The guy go to Dover Street Market, which I think is incredible and they have a pretty... You love their Paris location. It's great. Well, here is the thing about Dover Street. Everyone who works there is really nice. And I think that's hard when you have such a sort of very elevated and specific set of brands that you're selling, they could be extremely cold and sort of like, and at every store, the one in LA too. Like everyone's kind who works there. And I like that. I also just like going and seeing what they have, it feels different, but I go once every six months. It's not like every week where Barney's was a thing you did every single week. So the challenge is these stores need to change the way they operate in terms of the mix of product, in terms of how much revenue they actually think they're going to get out of the physical store. So someone like you is operating from a place of an advantage because you're not dealing with a bunch of 20 year leases at this point or whatever. So Barney's actually is an important comp. So even in our internal discussion, Barney's was absolutely one of the insposed for this whole design space project. So I know you haven't had time to check things out, but if you go to all the corridors, we picked this location for a reason. I wanted to bring back what Barney's and Beverly Hills felt like for me 10 years ago. I'd go there on Saturday, Sunday, spend all afternoon, walk up and down the floors, you know, at the time, like only buy things that are like 60% off, you know, but really enjoy that experience. And I made sure and some of the people here that are working on the event tool know, we literally put white carpet just for two days. So, you know, instead of just like what's down there, I wanted to look and feel like this luxury store experience. And then you mentioned the staff. All the sales associates we have here that we train come from luxury retail and art gallery background just for the weekend. And then we worked with Nike to customize their whole look and fit shoes included. And then everybody has an iPad and iPhone, everything's available online. But we have the convenience of being able to work with the sales associates too. So, we want to sort of combine all the best elements from a Barney's, let's say, or, you know, Dover Street, and then add the convenience of the online checkout process. So, if you see something you like, and you don't want to talk to the salesperson, you can just click buy on your basic space app for mobile.

Before we go, I do want to talk some designer musical chairs with you, because I know you have an opinion. So there's been a lot of changes in the fashion industry that I would say are partially like the catalyst was what we were talking about before, where everything sort of got generic. And then the brands got a little, maybe I can say this a little lazy, and then people stopped spending as much. And so now they have to shake things up. And there have just been tons. This happens every 15 years. I don't think it's out of the ordinary, but now the internet has made it. So like we're tracking it very closely, but there have been tons of changes at the houses, and they're basically all in place now. So Mathew Blazy is going to Chanel. Jonathan Anderson is going to Dior. Jack McCullough and Lazaril Hernandez, who were at Perones School, who found at Perones School are going to Lowewe, Louise Trotter is going to Bottega Veneta. Demna, who's been a Balenciaga forever is going to be a Gucci and Balenciaga is sort of the one that is remaining. And also John Galliano left Margiela. Glenn Martin's replaced him, but so no one really knows what's happening with Galliano. I think he's just going to start his own brand, like relaunch his own brand with LVMH. But anyway, what do you think of all this? Who are you most excited about, especially curious to know what you think about the Demna of it all? So as you know, Demna was a recommendation that I had made prior. You told them this five years ago that they should do this. Three and a half years ago. So was this before Alessandro McKaylee left? Correct. Okay. And you were like, you should put it. And did you get the idea that Demna should go to Gucci from the collaboration that? No, no, no, not at all. What makes you think, what made you have the vision that Demna should? Maybe you're a psychic. No, I mean, so Demna, again, I was a big buyer, well, not a big buyer, but because I couldn't afford it. But I loved the early like that stuff and Balenciaga. And I still buy Balenciaga. And I have a lot of random objects from Balenciaga, like towels and stuff too. Did you buy your wife the cup, the Starbucks Balenciaga Starbucks cup bag? Because Lauren Sanchez was just seen this morning, carrying it. No, but I do have other cups from Balenciaga, but not those. But no, like with Demna, I mean, I think he's arguably the most creative person. And I say that in a, and I see you nodding because it's not just designing clothes, it's understanding context and culture. And how he was doing this from Switzerland, always, he used to live in Geneva, was based in... Part time still does. Yeah. And that always fascinated me because he seemed to really grasp culture, American culture, what's in the zeitgeist. And I think, but then also clothing were, I mean, he would start literal trends than like other people copied, right? So I just felt like if you need a real change agent at scale, you need to really like swing for the fences. Some of the hires, not necessarily the ones you mentioned, maybe they're like safe choices. But I think Demna going to Gucci, like that's a big swing. And I think that's the right move, even if it's now instead of three and a half years ago. Yeah. I don't know if there are... And I know it's not popular from what people might say, but I don't know. I think people just don't understand it, which we can unpack quickly what it means. I would say there is no safe choice now. The only safe choice is Eddie Salman. But the issue with that is like, that's not even that safe at this point. Yes, I think a lot of people in the industry, if you want to talk about Gucci, felt like Alessandro Michele is incredibly talented. It was over. His moment there was over. It was so fashion and such a big trend that it had to end. Like he had to leave. If he had stayed 10 more years, it wouldn't have been good for him. It wouldn't have been good for Gucci. And so it made sense that he left. I think my feeling about what Gucci should have been next was really Italian preppy. And they should have hired someone who was really into preppy culture and classic traditional. Who would have been your choice then? That's not Eddie. Well, the person that I've said is Simone Bellotti, who worked at Gucci for 16 years and then went to Valley. But he was not... You could also argue that brand's too big for him. He's like the way he thinks. But someone is an unknown who really understood that part of Italian culture, I think would have been a good follow-up to Alessandro. Because you can just do really classic stuff, but then dig into this. And there was someone, Sabato's DiSarno got there, his early campaigns, they sort of were of that world where it was like athletic socks and Gucci tennis culture, all that stuff. They could have gone that way if they found the right person. The problem, I think Eddie is that... Eddie's extremely preppy. Like a lot of what... Yes, it's rock and roll, but a lot of what he did at Celine was like bourgeois, French, preppy clothes. So I think they should have dug into the bourgeois. And I think with Sabato DiSarno, that's what they wanted. And he just wasn't the right person and also didn't have the right infrastructure around him. All that said, I think that I'm a huge believer in D'Amna. I think he's an amazing product designer. He's amazing couture designer. He has a vision. He understands, like he's a quote unquote real designer who also understands product. And I do want to believe that he can do this because I love his basic B Balenciaga collections. This last one was like real clothes. I thought it was fabulous. There was stuff that I wanted. All the suits. All the suits, but also he did like a denim jacket with a popped collar and a tulip skirt. He called them quote unquote normal clothes. And I think that if he can kind of go into... Gucci archives are incredible. We've seen it and kind of take it. The one challenge I have with it. And the funny thing was the day of his show, that's when people started talking about him maybe going there. And I remember being backstage thinking like, it's just no way. Because the thing to me that is the complication is Gucci is a very warm brand. It's just a warm brand. It feels like there's like a golden sheen over it. No matter who designs it, no matter what their aesthetic is, Tom Fordham, Alessandro McKaylee, nothing is the same. But there's a warmth to it. And Demna as a person is a warm person. But I don't get warmth from his designs. And so this is his big challenge in life. Yeah, of course, he's making a ton of money and it's a great opportunity. It's exciting. But this is going to be a big... This is going to define how deep in fashion history he goes. Even if it's a total catastrophe, it's going to be impactful. And I'm just curious to see how he looks at Gucci and... Because he really needs to... It needs to not be about him. And most of his designs are really about him. So it'll be really interesting. Yeah, I think the only thing I'll add to that is because he's accomplished so much at a relatively young age and early part of the career. Perhaps he can kind of wear a different hat and really pivot. I mean, that would be insane if he could do the... Like you said, bring the warmth back somehow, which none of us would expect. But then maybe he can. Yeah, out of all of them, he's the one I want to succeed the most. But it's just reminding me though, even Carl Agarfeld, if you see his personal taste, you know that he was huge collective design, chrome hearts, like personally, he's into very eclectic things. But then between Chanel and... Why am I blanking? Fendi and Chloe. But the thing was his own line was not successful. But his personal aesthetic was not something that was like... Whereas Demna could launch his own brand and be hugely successful. It's just a question of, Carl Agarfeld was a stylist, he wasn't a designer or a stylist or whatever. He was a creative director. He wasn't a designer designer. Salarra is a designer designer. Demna is a mix of both. But I think more of a designer than a creative director. And so the question is, the reason he is sort of the goat in this era is because he is a mix of both. Most of them are one or another. Jonathan Anderson is more of a creative director. Matt too, I would say, is more of a designer. But because Demna has both and he's good at both, this is going to be the biggest test. Like if he can make a Gucci that we all want to buy, which is what it has to be in the end. Yes, the runway, cool, interesting, thought provoking, great. But it has to be something we all want to buy, then he'll go down in history. I'm betting on that jockey. Jesse, this is really fun. Thanks for having me. Yeah, thanks for having me. And hope you go shopping outside and make sure you have a really sales associate. Thank you. Thanks, everybody, for being here. Thank you.

It was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out. It was exciting. Critics and play rights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself?
