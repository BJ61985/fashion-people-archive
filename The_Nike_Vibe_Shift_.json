Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Puck's fashion and beauty memo line sheet. And today with me on the show is the Wall Street Journal's foremost expert on Mark Zuckerberg's Gold Chains, the one and only Jacob Gallagher. Today we're diving deep on Nike, the good, the bad and the vibe shift. Let's get started. Hey everyone, it's Lauren. Before we get going, I wanted to remind you that if you like this podcast, you'll definitely love Puck, where I send an email three times a week called Line Sheet. If you're a fashion person, you get that reference. It's an original look at what's really going on inside the fashion and beauty industries. Line Sheet is scoopy, analytical and above all fun.

Hey everyone, hope you had a great week. I've got a lot of people phoning in Intel from European boats and beaches these days. It feels like everyone is in Greece this year. I know hardcore fashion people have been going to Greece for a long time, Patmos and the like, but that was, I'd say, much more European focused. A lot of Americans are there this year and I don't just mean Celine Valandes, who EIC of Town and Country, very proudly Greek. Greek Orthodox. I grew up Russian Orthodox, so I feel like we have that in common. But anyway, let's not talk about religion on here. I have never been to Greece. Maybe next summer on the sheet this week. What if I just start calling it the sheet? I won't do that to you. Online sheet this week, Rachel Sturgatz, our beauty correspondent, has a really great interview with the CMO of cosmetics, Corey Marchasotto. I want to say she pronounces it like that, I hope. I'm not going to act like I know how to pronounce it. I'm also not going to act like I use Elf day to day. But I have been following Elf's rise the last five years pretty closely. And Corey gets into, really gets into the nitty gritty of how she pulled together like a Mike White written Super Bowl commercial starring Jennifer Coolidge. Another Jennifer Coolidge is another alum of Emerson College. Shout out to Emerson. And then also Corey talks about why did she do a collaboration with Liquid Death, which is a very popular beverage in the puck offices. And I didn't even know they had done one, but it was very successful. And she's just really smart. And the way they run the company is really smart. Rachel did a great interview with her. So you should check it out no matter what industry you work in. I also had a bunch of microscoops. I solved the JD Vance guy liner mystery with help from JD Vance's wife. You sent me a statement about it. So you should check that out. There is also some news about Proenza Scholar and Gap. I had a little scoop about, well, not a little one, a decent sized scoop about Perfect Magazine bringing on Jaleel Weaver, Rihanna stylist, editorial stylist. He's going to be a contributing fashion editor there and talk to Katie Gran about it pretty extensively. And I just like how Katie brings in the way she collaborates with other creative people I think is interesting and unique in the industry. And so we talked about that a bit. On Thursday, I also took a look at the glow up of Melinda Gates and people in her circle. There's definitely something happening in culture where very wealthy people who used to aim to kind of look shlubby on purpose are now making a real effort and embracing fashion and designer brands. And not like just Louis Vuitton bags. Like Melinda Gates in this new video series she's doing is wearing a scaparelli shirt dress that I had to do a little work to find on the internet. Like she definitely has a stylist and is really putting a lot of work into this. So I try to explain in Thursday's column why I think that's happening. I think it's a confluence of things. But read more on on Line She and Puck and enjoy this conversation between Jacob and me. We had a lot of fun with this episode. We both are very passionate about what's happening with Nike, which I've been talking about the last few weeks and he and I have both covered the company for a long time. So I think you're going to be entertained, but you also learn a lot. I hope you enjoy it. Jacob Gallagher, welcome to Fashion People. Thank you, Lauren. Welcome back. I'm happy to be back. Always happy to be back on Fashion People. OK, so this is a special Friday appearance from you. What'd you have for breakfast? I had one I always had. I had a Siggy's yogurt and a banana. Unsweetened Siggy's? No, the unsweetened I can't do. I think I had a like a strawberry Siggy's this morning. But yeah, I said what I always have, but that's actually a lie. I think last time I was on and you asked me, I said I had cereal. I've gotten off cereal. Cereal can't do too much sugar in the morning. I would argue that you should not be eating sweetened yogurt, but that's another thing. Did you know that Siggy's the guy from Siggy's? I think the founder is now on Gabriella Herzbord. I'm sure you also got this press release. I did. I think we're talking about his appearance. We were at the Gabriella Herz show and saw him there. He's a very hard to miss man. Yes. But he does not own Siggy's anymore, as far as I understand. We were talking and we saw him and you went to talk to him, I think. I think Rory did actually. I think Rory went over to figure out the deal of this man. Yeah, I mean, it makes sense if you know Gabriella Herz. It's her. She's very, she wants to do good with all the abundance she has is a good way to put it. And she is very into entrepreneurs who are who are trying to make the world better and all that stuff. So it makes sense to me. But anyway, I did want to ask you before we get started. So we have a very special Nike episode. Kind of the impetus is this LinkedIn post from this ex Nike employee that sort of set off something that's been happening for the last couple of years anyway, where Nike is having a little bit of a crisis. But so we're going to really get into the Nike brand and what has gone wrong and what they still do right and all of that. But really quickly, because this is running Friday morning, I saw you went to the industry premiere last night. And I was a Rory, Satan, your colleague. And also Lauren Schlossman went like a bunch of I was also invited to the industry premiere. And I thought I was special. It turns out they invited tons of fashion people, which I get it was a metrograph, right? So like, I don't know, maybe they were thinking like cool downtown. But so I know you've written about it. But a, have you watched the entire third season because I have, we probably are like not allowed to talk about it. But we can say a couple of things because it's going to premiere on August 11th and this is running August 9th. So I think we can at least say if we liked it or not and also comment a little bit about like why you think we were all here. You did a story connected to the industry, right? I've written about it, I think either once or twice. I can't remember. Rory's written about it twice for sure. Because we were talking about how much we've written about this show because the show is not as big as succession, if that's the bar. But I think it punches outside its weight class in terms of how much people seem to care about it, particularly in, I think the. I feel like there is something there about the fashion crossover. I mean, Conrad and Mickey, who are the show creators, they are very into clothes. They're very, they're like the two best dress show runners out there. And they have great taste. And there's a lot of things in the show that I references to clothes in that universe. The screening was a weird one. I don't know how they picked the invite list at all, because it was like some press, but then some people just kind of in their orbit. And then some, I guess, for lack of a better term, downtown people. But this show, this season is very good, in my opinion. I think that this is probably the best season yet. I think it's probably the easiest to understand from a financial standpoint. What's going on? And I think they're just now at this point where these characters are really fleshed out. And I loved it. I think it is the best show on TV right now. It is. The season is insane. It's very good. Is the only way it is insane. It is very smutty in a good way. And I agree. I do think it's it's great. And it's an interesting thing because it's not a fashion show, though. Marissa Abela, she's sort of the center of it this season. And her hair is like huge inspo for book tour hair for me. It's really good. But anyway, she always looks good because she plays a really wealthy young woman. So she all she has like the row back, which I'm sure Rory will will nod to the next in her next coverage. Like she she dresses very well. And there are a couple, I think the pink glasses, if you know what I'm talking about. That's a that's a moment there. But it's not. It's not like they're all dressed spectacularly head to toe. It feels like fairly realistic. And I think there's just something about. There's something about that it does feel like a very downtown New York show or or East Side London. It's set in the city. So like there's just something about it that feels it can it feels completely out there. Out there. And there were a couple scenes where I was like, the show has gone off the rails. This is insane. And then on the other hand, it but there's something about it that appeals to a certain type of fashion person. And it's interesting. I look forward to you and Rory exploring that more deeply and then me commenting on your stories in my link section. Yeah, I got to figure out what, if anything, I will write directly about it. This season doesn't have, I don't think, a breakout fashion moment in the same way that once have in the past, maybe. But I guess I'll see how people consume it. I watched the eight episodes like extremely quickly. I wanted to just know what happened. So I even watching the premiere again last night, I was reminded of a couple small details in the show that I think really both make it great and make it perhaps things worth writing about. So we'll see. But it's a really good show. And I'd love to hear from people as they watch it, kind of what stands out to them. Yeah, same, same. It's it's to me, it's more fun than succession in some ways to follow and sort of decode and all of that in some ways. Certainly. Yeah. It's not as like slicker as as well done, but in that kind of makes it better. Thus concludes our television critic corner. But but thanks to Conrad and Mickey for inviting all of us. I'm sorry I couldn't make it, but it felt insane for me to go to New York for that. It was good fun. And those guys are in town and if you see them, well, I guess this is coming out too late, but I'm sure they'll be shopping through New York for the next couple of days. I'm sure they go to Cafe Integra. They hang out with Chris Black there. The question is it's weird. They haven't been on How Long Gone. But I bet Chris doesn't watch the show and Jason. I'll ask Jason. I bet Jason and Chris don't watch it. They are frequent guests of throwing fits. I know that they're going on throwing fits again. This is this is very neat. We're getting into the very niche podcast drama realm. So I think maybe it's time we move on to a later topic of Mickey. You ever hit that moment when your kid asks for help with homework and you're like, wait, when did Long Division get this complicated?

Nike about two months ago, one of your first appearances, I said, we should do a deep dive on Nike. And then last week, this fellow. So I have covered a U2 covered Nike incrementally throughout our careers. I've done like big, pretty big in depth stories with them. I wrote a lot when I worked at BOF about their supply chain challenges because they had tried to localize their supply chain, brought bring more to production in Mexico and had some issues. So I wrote about that I've written about when they've tried to use like, this is not the right word, but vegan leather. Like maybe it was not vegan. Maybe it was just some like environmentally. I've done some really big deep dive stories. I've actually never been to Beaverton. I've been to Portland many times, but I haven't been to their campus, unfortunately, but but I've written about them on and off throughout the years from a brand perspective. So have you. They have a lot of collaborations. I'm sure you've done a lot of stories. They have had a hard time on the stock market in the last six months or year or so, because they basically did something where they their revenue has bumped from pre COVID, it was 39 billion billion. So it's like basically half of the footwear market that the like sneaker market up to, I think it was 51 billion in 2020. They're 2023 fiscal or they're 20 and maybe they're 2024 fiscal. They have weird fiscal years. But the point being that like the revenue is growing, but they did this crazy thing where the new CEO, John Donahoe, he started in 2020, decided we don't need wholesale as much as we used to. All the like Brett beloved brands in the world are going more direct to consumer. We need to take more direct. And so they pulled out of a ton of their very large direct, I mean, wholesale part partners like Dick's Sporting Goods and DSW and Zappos and all of these things. So they pulled out, they realized that was a bad idea for which we'll get into. And then they started to put them back in. But the result is that the revenue is not growing like it was. It barely grew this year. The only reason it did is they discounted a ton on their site. And the stock is not doing well. A lot of people, I talked to a bunch of people in Portland last week, some who work at the company, some who don't. And basically everyone's just like, this John Donahoe guy needs to go. Why is he the CEO? He's Nike is losing what they used to have. And there's just been like a lot of like the way the business press usually does manage these things, which is when a company's doing really well, they can do no wrong. And then when a company starts to like have a difficult time and if it's a public company, they basically just start to shit on it constantly. So that's what's happening right now in the business press where everyone's just like Nike sucks. And so this guy last week, he used to be, he ran marketing in Europe, I want to say. Um, he's Massimo Guionco, which I know is definitely not how you pronounce it. Maybe you have a better idea. Junko Massimo Junko. He wrote this LinkedIn post called Nike and Epic saga of value destruction. And he just kind of went through everything he thinks is wrong with it. And all these Nike employees commented. And that's where we are right now to start. Can you break down for me like the timeline of what you think has happened with Nike? OK, so you mentioned the wholesale thing. I think that that's a really important, you know, that's that's one brick in the wall here of what we're talking about. They they decide to pull back wholesale. They bring everything direct to consumer. I think at the time that probably looks like a really smart strategy, that seems to be fully where the market is heading. You know, at this point, you know, there's kind of competing logics here of what works best, but I think that that certainly that strategy had worked for a lot of brands, particularly in that kind of sporty apparel space. And so they were moving in that direction. I think it's also notable that they kind of move away. And this is one of the things that was touched upon in that LinkedIn post was like they kind of move away from being almost a like. And maybe this is is actually inserting my interpretation of what happened. They move away from being like a real performance driven company to being a real like lifestyle driven company. And what I mean by that is is they stop the vibe around Nike, the kind of messaging from Nike stops being like better, faster, stronger and more like for the everyday athlete, for the athlete and all of us, like whether or not that was the literal ad campaigns that they were doing at that time, or that was just kind of the way that the brand was positioning itself overall. That seemed to be the vibe that was coming across to the marketplace. And then you did mention supply chain. And I was looking back at their stock and, you know, they had pretty severe supply chain problems during the pandemic. I that was something that that we covered a lot at the Journal. A lot of companies had that. But, you know, they were one of those companies that was really affected by how difficult it was to get stuff out of China for a time. And then there was a supply chain backlog and, you know, Nike sneakers are planned and produced a year plus out in a lot of cases. And that really, I think, messed with what they were able to get into their stores. But to me, what I think the big what we're really talking about is like, as you mentioned, revenue is fine. You know, the financials of the company are not flashing red signs. This is a vibe check. This is this is what what what Nike is facing is a feeling that it's not as cool and not as relevant anymore. And it's losing market share, but it's losing clout more. And it's losing this feeling that it's like on the bleeding edge. And that has really clearly hampered what people think about it because, you know, it's strange because if you look at like I'm looking at a graph right now of the stock and it's basically gone. Like it went and had this bump kind of in the middle of the pandemic, I would say. And then it it cratered kind of coming out of the pandemic in the middle 20 in like the mid 2022s. And then now it's kind of just a little bit up and then back down again. But where it's sitting right now is below where it was five years ago, but not substantially below. But in the meantime, it did have a high. And I think maybe people thought that that high would be sustained. I think overall, though, the sentiment around the company is that the decline is going to continue because they are losing this this cool factor to the consumer. And because of how I cover a company like Nike, to me, a lot of that comes from the lack of innovation and the lack of product that I think is moving the market right now and the way that other companies, other footwear companies and we can get into some of those have taken that mantle of being the innovative progressive company that is both pushing sneakers and athletic wear forward from a. Innovation standpoint and from a creative cool factor standpoint. Honestly, we could really I don't know if I said this online or off, but we could talk about this for two to three hours and we're not going to. We're only going to talk about it for an hour for now because there this is so complicated and it goes. I think it goes back to company culture. That's at the core of what is going on and the innovation thing is a piece of that. But let's talk about the innovation thing for a minute and what happened around the Pegasus because they moved the new Pegasus up from 2025, right? Because they needed something new. And the thing that the thing I will say before before we talk about the innovation is that this market does not these new brands that are coming in. I mentioned in the piece I did, Hoka and on running in particular, because their stocks are there doing well. The businesses are doing well. Hoka is part of this bigger group, Decker's, but their shares are up quite significantly over the last couple of courses are very small businesses. These do not need to filch market share from Nike. This market can get bigger and that's what should actually be happening is that the market should get bigger. But what has happened with Nike is exactly what you went when you mentioned the lifestyle versus the performance. And in the past, the way that Nike market is marketed is they were really looking at 16 to 18 year olds. And they were saying, these are real athletes. Make people feel like they're an athlete. And then when you're 35 or 40 or whatever, you still wear Nike because that is what is the thing I think a lot of people don't get. And a lot of marketers don't get is this active wear athleisure athleisure movement is not people who buy that stuff. They still want to work out in it or they they want to think they're going to work out in it. So even though people wear it around, they wear it to get coffee, they wear it to brunch. It's mostly still bought with the intention of performance. So when Nike was marketing as a performance company, even with their Sakai stuff, like it has a performance element to it, it was sort of getting the lifestyle people to. But when they started to want to do more with women, they saw this big opportunity. I remember meeting with them. It would have been in 2019 in Paris and talking to them about the Jordan brand women opportunity. And they just they feel like they haven't they haven't done enough for women. So when they they sort of did two things, they went, life, they started to move away from this performance thing, away from marketing to this teenager as much and more towards lifestyle and more towards gender. So they reorganize the business instead of being in categories to be gendered. So it was like women's versus men instead of all basketball together, all and they've they've unwound that in the same way they've unwound the DTC thing. But I think it was a huge, huge mistake because then the women's golf and the men's golf, they're not talking. And so and the also gender is such a and they their gender is also includes children. So it was like men's women's children, let's split them all. But all of that and this can get really unwieldy and we will try not to. But it's I think it's a brand that we're both like very passionate about covering and we both wear it and all that stuff. Let's talk about the innovation bit to you and and what that means in the market and for the consumer. I think there's two buckets to talk about innovation. I think for one, you have the core kind of sporting innovation and you can see, you know, this was something that now it seems to be finding Nike basketball seems to be finding some of its legs again, maybe that seems to be there seems to be some indication that some of those shoes are breaking through. But, you know, in terms of, you know, let's take basketball, they were not having a shoe that was breaking through from anyone in a major way. They had signed some huge athletes, but nothing, none of those shoes were kind of becoming a performance shoe and a lifestyle shoe in the way that Jordan's had. They were really focusing on retching a lot of Jordan's and we can kind of get into the the I think problems that came out of that in a second. But, you know, on running, they stop, you know, you talk to runners, they stop being a brand that people were buying first when they would just get into running or when they were trying to improve their mile time and other Brit, you know, I started noticing a lot of people that I worked out with wearing on shoes and you would talk to them and they'd be like, oh, no, I went to the store and this is what I was recommended that I buy to kind of start working out in. And in years past, it probably would have been a Nike. And so losing that market share on the performance front, because the shoes were kind of not being looked at as innovative in the way that on were or in the way that Hoka were with the kind of squishy soul and looking at something new in the marketplace that I think hampered their reputation in the sporting world. On the kind of more creative fashion front, we were seeing a similar thing happening where effectively the shoes that were landing fashion wise or style wise were retro's. And so this is something that I wrote directly about was is that Nike cycled through pushing out, you know, things like the dunks, things like the Jordan ones, and they really did catch fire and had a strong business, but then people tired of them. And they, I think in my opinion, went too hard on dunks and then the dunks got really oversaturated and they became so omnipresent that that texture, that cool factor that Nike once had, it was too mass. And there was nothing that came behind that as far as a new idea. These were shoes that had been in Nike's catalog for, in some cases, several decades, and there was nothing coming behind that that was grabbing the consumer in the same way that earlier innovations of recent, of the recent past, like the Flyknit did. And this is something that I'll shout out. Noah Johnson from GQ wrote about directly, like, I remember when the Flyknit hit the market and it was innovative from a construction standpoint. And the way that they packaged it was doing a collaboration, you know, with Hiroshi Fujiwara and having that be really limited, a certain model. And then there was this, you know, other models that were more approachable to the marketplace and that push really landed and that shoe became really cool, really fast. And the way that Nike has handled collaborations with, you know, more innovative models in the, in the past couple of years hasn't been the same approach. You know, you can think about things like the Cactus plant flea market AirFly2, which is probably the most out there shoe that they've released in the past 10 years, this kind of tire looking, bulbous, inflated rock climbing shoe almost. That shoe came and went because it didn't have a place in the broader Nike portfolio. And so these new ideas seem to be popping and fizzling really fast, where the retro stuff seems to be what still is keeping their brand up. But how long that last is an open question because we're obviously seeing the consumers no longer have this dedication to Nike that they once had, you know, the gotta have it effect of Jordan's in the past. It is starting to wither when you talk to sneaker collectors, where they're willing to buy from on or from new balance in particular, or from ASICs, which has had a huge resurgence. Those brands are stealing market share from them because Nike is not offering something right now that is really making the consumers heart race. I mean, I spoke directly to Jordan collectors that were like, Oh, my God, how can they expect me to just buy yet another colorway of a Jordan one or a Jordan four or Jordan 11 and be happy with that. Or, you know, the black and white panda dunks were everywhere. And so once the shoes everywhere, it's no longer cool and no one wants it anymore. And that dilutes the entire dunk line. And that, I think, to me, at least in terms of who I speak with, that seems to be what has really harmed their brand image in the past couple of years. Yeah, one of their competitors said to me, someone who had worked there, but now works at a competitor, like you can't just keep releasing. If you look on Heist and Abiety or Hypebeast, and there's like a new Nike release every two days or whatever, and it's just like a new upper or new colorway, and it's not enough. Two points on what you said. One on that it's not a go to for runners. Or runners is just one example. Obviously, that's like a very big market for them, but it's no longer the like first sneaker you buy if you're working out. One reason for that, I think, is because they've pulled back so much from wholesale. And now they're going back in. But the problem is, they think of themselves as a luxury brand, and in many ways they are. And all the luxury companies look to them for inspiration. I mean, Nike to me has always been so inspiring because you can buy it at Coles and you can buy it at Dover Street Market. There aren't that many brands that Levi's is one of the few others. And I'd say they're not as successful as Nike in that way, but they are close. So the thing is, when you buy a Gucci bag, you do not need to go to Nordstrom or even Marcus or whatever to buy it. You can go to Gucci and have a really amazing experience. When you are buying a pair of sneakers, it's kind of like jeans, actually. You do need to try them on, especially if you're using them for running. And I don't know, I'm curious, what do you run, right? Like, what do you wear for running? Or do you just do tennis? I wear K-Swiss when I play tennis. Got it. And I wear Brooks or A6 when I work out. Yeah. So I wear Soccany right now, but I've worn Brooks. I've worn, there was this weird brand that outdoor voices used to sell that has a weird nub on the foot that Chris Black was obsessed with. And I started, I wore for all my marathons. I forget what it was called. I don't even know if it exists anymore. But I haven't worn Nike's to run in since I started running. Like it just, it's not the go-to for sure. But the main issue is when you go to, so there's this new running shop. Now, obviously, like we know the rise of run clubs as this like social activity or whatever. There's all these, there's a really cool run shop in Paris. I think it's called Distance that in the fourth around the Smolt that is really great. There's this one on Echo Park Avenue in Echo Park called LSD, Long, Long Slow Distance, not Lauren Santon-Domingo. But I went in the other day and I actually do need new sneakers, but I'll probably just replace my Soccanese cause I really like them. But they have a ton of stuff. They have district vision. They have, I don't think they have satisfied, but they have tons of on running clothes. They have tons of stuff for sneakers. They have new balance. They have on, they have tons of on. They have Adidas, nor, yes, that is the one that I was like, should I buy a pair of these? They don't have Nike. They, if they did, I didn't, I didn't notice it. And that's an issue because the thing is like running is cool now. These people, yes, they're going to wear this stuff for whenever, but like the point of it is, is performance and you want to look good when you're, when you're at the running club and trying to pick people up or whatever you're doing. So, so like that is, that is a big issue for them is that they're just not getting on people in the same way. And then I want to talk a bit about their collaboration strategy because one thing I called up Matt Powell last week, the, the very famous analyst who, who covers this market really closely. And I asked him what he thought because he had commented on a Masimo's LinkedIn post and said, I agree with most of what you said, but not everything. And one thing he brought up that I thought was really interesting was the reason new balance has had such success with their collaborations is they do these collaborations, the drops are what 5,000 sneakers or something like that, maybe 50,000, but usually like 5,000. But then they also are releasing like a commercial standard generic version of that sneaker. Maybe it's a style that hasn't been around for a long time so that if you don't get the collaboration, because you're not fast enough or you don't have a bot or whatever, tracking this stuff, you can just buy them and Nike doesn't do that. And it was interesting. I actually, I wonder if they'll ever show up, but I bought a pair of those Stucey Nikes, that latest release, which is called the LD 1000. I bought a pair of them. Hopefully they'll actually show up, but I love them. I think they're so good, but you can't buy that sneaker, like a generic version of that sneaker really, right? Like it's, they have the Cortez, but it's slightly different and I like this style better. And it seems like a big missed opportunity. So curious from your perspective, you're following their collaborations much more closely than I am. What has changed in the collaboration space and what could they do better? You really just put your thumb on it. It's just a, there's a difference in strategy here that I think has been to their detriment, where, you know, the new balance 550, like that's a shoe that Teddy Santis and Amelie on door, like unequivocally made happen. And then they released the ALD ones. And then new balance was very smart and just papering the market with the general release ones. And so you could be walking down the street and there was, there were incredibly fine details between the collaboration ones and the, the Teddy Santis and the, and the regular release ones, the general release ones. So if you were walking down the street, you couldn't tell the difference. The same was kind of true for a lot of the ASICs that have come out in recent memory. Like there are the Kiko ASICs, which, you know, are very compelling and have their own collecting universe. But ASICs was in the mainline taking cues from what was happening there and offering pretty unique distinct colorways of similar models in their mainline. And so you could get a taste if you were not grabbing the collaboration or you were not able to or what have you. Nike has had a few pretty big quote unquote collaborations in the past couple years. Like let's, if we go back to Sakai, like the Sakai shoes come out, they're a huge hit in, in the collaboration category, but the, the echo of them doesn't land in the Nike mainline. Like the, the shoes that Sakai was riffing on do not become hits or do not become really popular within the Nike mainline because they're not really a focus in the Nike mainline. Bode just releases the, what is it? The, the AstroGrabber that happens. It, there is zero ripple effect of that in terms of what Nike is offering on Nike.com right now. They, there isn't, I think they tried. I think there was a similar shoe that they released around that time that kind of looked like it, but doesn't really land as, as far as moving units in the mainline. You just mentioned the Stussy shoe. This is a model, like it's a waffle sold meshed upper. It's very retro. It's very low profile. It feels like it should really be landing in this moment. Nike is not pushing a silhouette like this in their mainline. It doesn't seem to be a focus for them. Even the Stussy model, as I'm talking with you, like I could buy this on StockX right now for, I think $10 more than what the retail price was. That's very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very bad in terms of showing how much impact that collaboration has had. No one seems to want these shoes. And that's bewildering to me in a way because it used to be that any Nike collab would have some kind of bump on the resale market in the immediate after. But I think that it seems to me like what's happening in the collaboration space is not feeding the mainline in a way that it should. And you said earlier that the kind of men's golf, women's golf, not talking with each other, it feels to me like the collaborations are not talking with the mainline in a way that I think would help add this general glaze of cool over things. I know I've said cool like a million times on this podcast already, but I think that that's really what we're there up against here is this lack of breaking through in the market and feeling hype that Nike used to have. It's just absent. And I don't, the strategies do feel different. I think, you know, there used to be a time where you'd kind of see a shoe trickle out through the runway, they would take time and set in people's minds and then they'd want it and there'd be a huge hype release and what have you. I also think it's worth noting that the market has broadly changed and this kind of frenzy around collaboration shoes that were really out there and really doing something wild, you know, like the, going back to like the Nike Air Yeezy, like huge shoe, very progressive at its look, really landed with a dramatic impact on the marketplace. You know, there were other kinds of Nikes that came out around that time that were doing something, as I said, like the Flynet. That doesn't seem to be where tastes are right now. You know, we are in a very retro sneaker moment. And so I think it does in a way that might contradict what I said earlier about Nike focusing on retros and that perhaps hampering their business right now. But I think Nike did get stuck in that where they were like, this is what the market wants. So we're going to keep feeding the market. I think that there needs to be some new idea that they really put a ton of emphasis behind. Release it up boutiques, get it back into Union, try it, you know, Union, No Tray concepts, these smaller boutiques that they used to rely on to really get an idea out there. Getting them back into the fold, doing releases like that, seeing how it might move the market, that could help them in terms of just pushing what a sneaker looks like right now, because they can play with that more than most brands can. But it's a real uphill climb for them right now, I think, because nothing is really landing. Yeah, I was just trying to look through notes from someone who used to work at one of those stores explaining how Nike's community strategy used to work and how they would seed product in those stores. I think the issue is to me, there isn't, I guess, Hermes is the closest thing. Years ago, probably 15 years ago, I wrote a blog post that is not available on the internet about Apple and Hermes being very similar, long before the Apple Watch. And it is interesting that Nike, Hermes, Apple are all connected through the Apple Watch, which should do the end of the Apple Watch. On another podcast, maybe, because I have a lot of feelings about what's going on there. But the point being that this brand was unassailable and also people want Nike to be good. They find comfort in the same way, wealthy consumers, they want Apple to be good. They don't want Apple to start to be icky, which is starting to happen with Apple too. You're just kind of like, this product isn't as good as it used to be. It's not as cool as it used to be. No one wants that to happen. People take comfort in Nike being good and cool and not being this volatile brand in the same way they take comfort in Levi's. There are certain brands that, I think that everybody wants it to succeed. And so when they make these mistakes that feel very unavoidable, it's not that people are looking to pick it apart or looking for something new or whatever. They want it to be like Kleenex. They want it to be good all the time. So that is why I think there's been such a sort of uproar with all of this. But when you go back and if we look at the fundamentals of why this happened, we could kind of pick apart each of the strategies and what went wrong, the DTC, the supply chain issues, the collaboration, the fashion, the communications, the marketing. I mean, let's talk really quickly about the marketing, this new campaign, which I talked to someone from Nike yesterday was like, it's been really well received. Everyone really likes it. And that that might be true. I haven't looked up online sentiment for the campaign, but my reaction to the campaign, which is winning isn't for everyone is, okay, well, then I don't want to buy Nike because winning is for me. Because if you don't want to be a winner and like, especially in our culture right now, like none of those people from industry are excited about a brand that says winning isn't for everyone. Like it just doesn't feel, it feels, it feels too, like outdoor voices had a great tagline, which was, what did they used to say? Not doing things. But it was like recreate, it was like for recreation, they had a cute tagline that was basically like for people who move. And I thought that was they really got the lifestyle element of it, even though I wore outdoor voices and I still do to run and to exercise and all that, the performance was decent in those early days. But like, I just think that part of it is off as well. Like, I assume they are trying to appeal to Gen Z and millennials who are more less like stabby as older generations. I don't know why do you think they decided to go with such a sort of inclusive marketing strategy when, like if it almost feels exclusionary in its inclusiveness or something. I don't know if I'm reading it as harshly maybe as you are. It was extremely bad timing because in the immediate aftermath in the Olympics, Noah Lyles runs the 100 meter, wins in a pair of Y3 spikes beating a crowd of field of folks wearing Nike. Like, maybe Nike is taking their message a little too to heart there. But you said something that makes me think of Nike is just overthinking itself into a box here where it's like, this feels very broadly palatable. And what was so great about early Nike marketing in a lot of ways was its aggression, frankly. And it's, you know, we are number one feeling and it's kind of recklessness at times. You know, obviously my brain goes to tennis, but there were just incredible ads of the Agassiz, Sampris era where they're stopping traffic to play tennis and holding, you know, in their, these shirts with slogans that are, you know, pretty assertive about winning. And I do think it is perhaps a misreading of the room. Athletic excellence right now is something that like feels very celebrated. You know, maybe I'm just thinking of the Olympics a little too much, but like, you know, the American NBA team is back and, you know, everyone wants, you know, the American soccer team to thrive. And, you know, we're watching records get broken all the time. And, you know, this is a moment where people were really celebrating Simone Biles and, you know, the continued reign of LeBron James. Like, these are things that are just the lingua Franco Franco of American life. Like everyone knows these things. They know these excellent athletes and they are willing to celebrate them. And I think that that to me, there's this opening right now of pure aspiration and saying, we have these people in our camp and you should, you probably want to play and compete like them too. I think Nike in a way needs to communicate top down right now, as opposed to trying to communicate, you know, with the masses. And who knows if that really would make a difference, but it's a pretty clean cut message of this will make you run faster, jump higher, play better, you know, win your weekend tennis match. Like, you know, that is compelling. And I think it's a lot more compelling than, you know, go run at your own pace. Like I think that that I don't know if that really moves people to spend. We're really talking about fashion in its fashion as an aspirational thing. And I think when brands kind of lose sight of that, they lose sight of pushing the envelope, which I think is what drives people to shop. It's time for spring cleaning.

A, this is a really big company that I don't think they got lazy in any way. I think it's just when you're really big, you feel a lot of responsibility, and with great power comes great responsibility or whatever the Spider-Man quote is. I don't read comic books, but anyway, I think they got really big, and so that is part of, and the market got really big, and so that's part of the pressure and all that stuff. But what I think this comes down to is company culture. So in the 2010s, Nike had a very particular company culture. If you worked at Nike, you would work there for 30 years. When you would leave, a lot of people had challenges, or they would have challenges going in. It's just, it's like any very high-performing, particular, special place. It's, it was a challenging company culture. And so, if you were a Nike person and you performed in the way, there's an ex executive who was there for like a long time who's been a CEO at other companies. I've talked to a lot about it. The way they described it is the love them up way of management. So you're like, you're great, you're great, you're great, you're great, you're great. And then people perform. And I will say that I enjoy this type of management. I perform better when everybody's like, you're great, you're great, you're great. Some people don't. Some people like need to hear, you suck, you suck, you suck, you suck, you suck. And then get built back up, which I've also experienced and can handle, but don't enjoy as much. So anyway, the point being that like, if you leave that also at Nike, such a big company, that's like third, even at the end of 2019, $40 billion. That's a huge company. It's bigger than, it's way bigger than, it's twice the size of Louis Vuitton, almost three times the size of Louis Vuitton at this point. That's like 50 million companies in one, like Jordan is a company on its own. So like you're doing a tiny little job, you leave, and then suddenly you're the CEO or you run a whole division and you don't know what to do because you're used to executing on this very small, you might be good at leadership, but you're not going to execution. So anyway, the point being in the mid 2010s, they sort of had this reckoning around like me too, and inclusivity, and treating people shitty and all this stuff. And their reckoning was covered. The way I described it in my column was like, this wasn't a business insider toxic culture story, which, you know, they do what they do. And, and it's often enjoyable. This was like a New York Times story. And they, there were several of them. And so they really had to kind of look inward and say, what are we doing wrong? And so at the same time, this was a time when Mark Parker, who had been the CEO for, I think, 20 years, started in 1979 as a shoe designer, is leaving the business. They bring in this guy, John Donohoe, who's really good buds with the co-founder Phil Knight. They've been in done businesses together, all this stuff. But he is like a career CEO. He is worked at eBay. He worked at, I don't know, with some cloud computing stuff. Like, he's not, they all call him tech. I don't know if he's like really a tech, but like, he is a career CEO. So he comes in. And whether or not he, he meant to do this, like, the company culture changes a lot. And then they lay a ton of people off. So you lay a bunch of lifers off. These people get pissed. They get annoyed. They're like, this was my baby. I devoted my life to you. Lay me off. I'm sure they all got good packages. But I think what it comes down to is like, all of these issues go back to that. And what is that, what the challenge is, like, in, I don't know if you've, you've read anything on this term or you all talk about this term in your office. But I've, I've reported on this a lot. And it comes up in startups a lot where culture fit, which is you're not even allowed to say the term anymore. But I think that that is what it comes down to at Nike, where they spent years only hiring people who are a good culture fit. And then it wasn't okay to think that way anymore. And they had to lay people off. They had all these other issues. They had the COVID bump that everyone had. And then they lost it. They thought that they needed to be more lifestyle and they, they should have been kept on performance. They lost the innovation bit. They lost supply chain. All these things happen together. And what it comes down to is they sort of lost the plot on who they were as a company because they got so big. And so to me, that is the core of it. And that is my book pitch, if anybody would like to buy the book, I'm not available to write it for at least 10 years. This makes perfect sense. Like, I think that you're probably onto something. We are, we're talking about this company and I know a lot of people are going to listen and I'm glad people value our opinion. But this company is so big, like it's like, it's like, honestly, comical thinking about how, how giant it is and how like our opinion on it, like, you know, I, I think I'm, I think both of us are reading the company pretty accurately here and in a certain way and interpreting what's going on. But like, this company is, is huge. It's kind of weather this, you know, little blip of a storm or whatever. And I think the idea that he's going to lose that he's not going to be CEO anymore because of something like this is just farcical. Like the company is doing relatively well right now. And I think we will see a lot of decisions made to realign it a little bit, but it's not like, again, it's not like this is a five alarm fire on the revenue front. So I think that Nike will find its way through. I also do think, as I alluded to earlier, that a lot of this is just reliant on consumer tastes in a given moment. And the consumer tastes have shifted, that has opened up space for competitors to really get a toehold. And the, the strategy that, that Nike is currently employing might have worked in a less competitive climate, but it's getting more and more competitive as time goes on. You know, a decade ago, on an, an ASICS and NORDA and, you know, to a certain extent, New Balance were not as big of factors in this space at all. And Nike, it was really a two horse race between Nike and Adidas. And now they have to be checking not just their blind spot, but, you know, they've got to check every mirror every second of the day to see who's in their rear view. And I'm really curious to see what comes next from them. I would love to see a truly wildly progressive idea that they put a lot of oomph behind and a lot of attempts to make it land in the market. I think Nike has been playing it relatively safe for the time being. But I would love to see a new idea that might move the market. But I would say that about fashion as well. And so I think this is a, we're talking about a broader market wide issue in a certain way. And I think these brands that are smaller have just fared better because their, their success has comparatively lifted them further in your eyes. Like, like, you know, do you think this is something that in a year, we're going to be talking about a revitalized Nike? Or do you think this is going to be a five, 10 year project for them? Okay, so two points. One is there's a bigger existential question of like what we expect from these brands and why they can't deliver it. And that has to do with like the way creativity happens today. And that's another, that's for another, another conversation. But I think like, for me, the advertising is as important as the actual product in the case of Nike. And I think in the case of a lot of fashion brands too, like if you're not inspired by the message that they're sending, it's not fun to shop, shop the brand. I don't think most people think that way, but as someone who kind of cover, I feel like what I read about more than anything is marketing. And so it's interesting to me. But in terms of what's going to happen with them, I'm always more skeptical than most people. Like when I start to see a brand turn, I'm like, ooh, that's, it's not going to be good. And I think, I think about Apple a lot in this way too, these brands are fine and you're right, like Nike's not going anywhere, it's only fine, it's like very dominant, it will be dominant for the next 30 years in one way or another. I think a lot, but a lot of this depends what has happened in the last like 10 years is rise of activist investors and Phil Knight, who is I think 92 or something has come out twice this year to say that he supports John Donahoe. That's crazy. Like the fact that he's had to do that. And what I think if they don't figure it out and they don't like increase profits and, and figure out the wholesale thing and, and not have so much extra inventory or all that stuff, like an activist investor. And if the stock keeps going down, an activist investor, like what Matt said to me was like, you know, they really are like, he said the biggest thing they've done is like rely. He, they kind of thought, okay, we're going to pull out of online multi-brand, everybody will come to Nike.com. That didn't happen. And now they've had to discount a lot. Now they're in this crazy discounting cycle. Dan, my husband was saying, he's like, yeah, this thing I wanted that is never on sales on sale right now. That's going to be that is probably the discounting is probably the hardest thing to get out of if you look at like a gap or whatever. It is really hard to get out of the discounting cycle. So if they don't like nip this in the bud fast, then there might be an activist investor who comes in and ends up pushing him out. And, but the thing, but what I think and what I hope will happen and why, and I think everybody hopes it will happen. So probably will is that they will course correct. He already has unwound a lot of the strategies and gone back. They've brought back their new CMO was someone who was there for 20 years. They pulled her back in and, and she replaced someone she worked with for a long time. So I think the big things they need to do are one, get the advertising right and the messaging right and back on track, which is really tricky to get the, get the product and the innovation back and then three, get the apparel right. Because I think that is somewhere where they are just missing a trick and I still buy it almost exclusively, but I buy like weird sizes and, and random fit because, because like it doesn't fit correctly. It's not exactly right. So I'm always like, I basically hack it to make it work. But, but I think if they do those three things and they do, and they figure out on the back end how to make it all work supply chain distribution, all that, they'll be fine. And they have the ability to do that. The thing that I would, I would end with on, on my part is this week, I bought a vintage Nike t-shirt on Etsy because I've always wanted like a really good swish t-shirt. And I was looking at Olympics vintage like 1984 LA Olympics gear, which I got Fritz, my son, the most amazing t-shirt. It's so good. It was actually a Nikon that I cut into a t-shirt. It looks so good. But the point being that like I bought that. I don't wear a ton of logo stuff, but I was like, Oh, I've always wanted a Nike swish and it kind of came up when I was searching for this Olympic stuff on Etsy. And so it's a brand that everyone's rooting for. So if they bring some emotion back to everything they're doing and execute on the level that they are capable, then it will be okay. And if they don't, then it's going to be a really rough five or 10 years. So what you just said remind me again of it's funny that that's where you, you, you wanted to, uh, to land on because that's also where Noah's GQ piece landed. That's where the Apple comparison sings through. Apple, you know, in the tech space, people bemoan and, and, and crow about Apple not being innovative, but people still love an Apple logo. People still collect old Apple stuff. People still, you know, post Steve Jobs quotes, you know, the, the brand capital doesn't wither in a day or after one bad earnings call, you know, and, and I think that the Nike swish is one of those very rare, very forever logos that people are always going to want a piece of it still in your mind's eye reflects excellence and athletic victory and cool and all these things, but that's for our generation. And that's how we feel. And the question is how long does that last when you have a teenage generation currently that doesn't think of Nike in that way necessarily that thinks new balances might be cooler or that thinks, you know, buying aloe, I don't know that, that, that, that, wherever they get their leggings from that, that's cooler than anything Nike related. That is the law. That's the long-term existential crisis for the brand. I think that they will figure that out just because they are so big that they're going to always be in front of people. But that's, that's the broader question in my eyes. Yeah, I think that we, the emotions that our generation feels around brands, perhaps, are not the same as younger generations. That's more fleeting because they are have access to so much more that they're the idea that these, these consumers aren't brand loyal, I think is the wrong framing probably, but they just don't have as much. They, they know too much when we were little and like, I want to be like, Mike, like that commercial could make you cry. Like that doesn't happen anymore because people understand them, they understand the mechanics of marketing and, and all of this has to do with like, there's so much more transparency in our culture in many ways. So like, and, and more grant granularity. So I said that a word, but whatever, you know what I mean? It's all like weirdly connected with the people get what's actually happening with the marketing, but also, and that's like, sort of why the activists investors feel like they can say stuff. It's all, it's all connected of, of Twitter freaks out about something and suddenly we have a new president. Like, you know, it's just, it's all everything is so transparent. So it's just, you're right. And they need to think about it differently. And it might be in a way, that's so funny about, I actually was thinking, I saw Noah's headline, but I haven't read it yet. And I was like, maybe we should have had him on too. I don't know if he would be allowed, but maybe I could ask Will Welch if it was okay next time, next time. But it is, it is a thing of we are not them. And so, and how they interact with brands is just so different from how we do. And so Nike needs to be different. And it might not be something that makes us happy, which so we'll just keep buying vintage, which is the other amazing thing about, about this, this culture right now is that you can buy your nice Nike t-shirt. Well, I think that we have a lot more to say, but I think that this was a good initial hour of coverage on Nike. But let's, you know, obviously It was great. So much more to come. And any, anyone out there listening that, that, that has thoughts from, from inside Beaverton, email one of us, I'd love to hear what you think is going on there. No, no, email me first. Email me first though. Jacob.gallagher to the shank.com. Thank you. Jake. Lauren and Punk. Thank you, Lauren. This was really fun. Thank you very much. You're the best. This was so fun. Thank you for doing this. And we'll do, maybe we'll do a mini, because you're coming back, I think the last week in August, we'll do like a mini update on this if once we get feedback. Also, don't forget to read Jacob's coverage on Mark Zuckerberg and his glow up, if you want to call it that, as well as you had a whole thing this morning on the Minnesota guy, right? Yeah. Tim Walz is going to be running tomorrow. I'm very interested to see what the readers will think of that. She picked the most sartorially interesting of the candidates. I would say Shapiro looked like an Obama clone in a way in how he dressed. Shapiro is a rumpled Midwestern dad, more like. So go read that if you've not already. And more in that ilk in the next couple weeks as I'm going to the DNC. And then we'll be able to talk about that when I'm back. So yeah. Wow. So the thing about Tim Walz that I have found is that he is 60 years old, younger than Brad Pitt. Is this a little bit of what you get into? Which is, we maybe we'll talk about this on the, on the next episode, you're on, but I'm very interested in the way he presents himself as a 60 year old because 60 is quite young these days. And he is more traditional in his, in his nice. Oh, I like this navy jacket with the unbuttoned shirt though. That looks good. We'll talk. We'll talk about it. I'll read your piece and we can discuss for it. Okay. Thanks for cutting me off, Jacob. I'm just kidding. It was great. You're the best. Thank you.

In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination, go into creating their prize-winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out. It was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th. Follow and listen on Apple Podcasts, the Odyssey app, Spotify or wherever you get your podcast.",
