And today with me on the show, I have Ghani's Nikolai Refstrup, co-author of the new book, the Ghani Playbook, How to Get Started Creating a Responsible Business. If you hate greenwashing but you love making money, this episode is for you. Let's get going. Hey everyone, it's Lauren. Before we get going, I wanted to remind you that if you like this podcast, you'll definitely love Puck where I send an email three times a week called Line Sheet. If you're a fashion person, you get that reference. It's an original look at what's really going on inside the fashion and beauty industries. Line Sheet is scoopy, analytical, and above all, fun. Along with me, a subscription to Puck gained you access to an unmatched roster of experts reporting on powerful people and companies in entertainment, media, sports, politics, finance, the art world, and much more.

Happy Friday, everyone, and happy 5th of July for those of you in the United States. I am recording this way ahead of time as I am off today and I was off yesterday. So if there is a big designer appointment or whatever, I will comment on Monday. No emergency pod is happening. It's not how we operate at Puck, but don't worry. If something does happen, you know you'll hear from me and you'll get the real story. So that's a little caveat. Today, though, I hope you enjoy this interview with Nikolai from Ghani. As you'll hear, I actually talked to him about working on this book a few years ago. I was too busy and honestly, I was not the right person for it. Brooke Roberts Islam wrote it with him and she was great for it. What I have always admired Nikolai and Dita's attitude about their co-founders of Ghani, Dita is the designer. Kind of like building a fashion company in the modern age. It's not easy to do. It's not easy to make money. It's not easy to do it in a responsible way. And I really don't, as you know, I don't write a lot about sustainability because it's not a real word in Line Sheet. There is a way you can build a business responsibly and hopefully still make money because that's the whole point of doing business, which some people forget about, especially in the fashion industry anyway. It's really great to kind of get into all of that with Nikolai and congrats to him and Brooke on writing a whole book, which I know from experience is hard even if you have a co-author. So I hope you enjoy this MPS. I sadly didn't ask Nikolai what he had for breakfast. I don't know how I forgot. I think it was because it was already like nine o'clock at night in Copenhagen when we talked. But as for me, I obviously don't know what I'm going to have for breakfast on July 5th because it hasn't happened yet. But I am going to guess I skipped breakfast because I probably ate a lot last night at my friend's barbecue. And I'm also going to predict that we do a family outing to Squirrel for lunch today, where my go-to is the Sorrel Pesto Rice Bowl Hold the Rice. Very fashion person of me. But I hope you enjoy this conversation with Nikolai and have a great weekend. Nikolai, thank you for being on Fashion People. Thank you so much for having me. I really appreciate it. So this book that you've written, I was just chatting with your team about this the other day that you and I had a conversation about it, I want to say three years ago or so. Is that possible? Or even four? I think I already lived in LA when we talked, but you were trying to figure out how to put it together. And I said, I think it's a great idea for someone else to work on with you. Yeah, you were too busy at that point. Too busy. But I am just so impressed by how it's turned out. It's really fun to read. And well, I think it's fun to read because it's about the business, how to build a modern fashion business. And I'd say anyone, it's very entertaining. You just done such a great job with it. Maybe we can start before we get into the nuts and bolts of the book, which are extremely fun and informative and punchy and all that good stuff. How about we get into Ghani itself and how you and Dita ended up there? I think a lot of people in the industry think that you are the founders and you are the founders of the new iteration of Ghani, but it did exist previously. Maybe you can just explain how you ended up there and when you started to sort of transform it into the business that it is today. Right. Yeah, so bear in mind that I come from a background in tech basically. So I mastered in what was back then called e-business basically. So I have somewhat of a software background. I spent 10 years in that industry. Last project I did was a very early attempt at building like a chatbot, a digital friend that was chat based, right? And I raised $10 million for that. It was a lot of money back in 0405. I gave it a good shot, but it turned out to be probably 10 years too early. If not 20 and definitely three or $5 billion short, right? So by 0809 I was a little frustrated with the tech industry and I was looking for something else to do. And my wife had kind of started working on a project called Ghani. It was a very small business ran by a friend of ours who was a connoisseur of finer things in life. He had a cashmere in the brand that was called Ghani, but he also did a bit of like art and imported wine, great guy by the way. And did it kind of design a couple of shoes for him. They did well and then a couple of dresses and at some point they asked me if I wanted to join the business. And I kind of slowly transitioned into that, although it was never like a conscious plan, right? And suddenly I was there. And that was around 2010. Yeah. So I think they kind of transitioned at least for this perspective started already in 07 and by 09 I kind of stepped in on a full-time basis, right? So our timeline starts at 09. So when did you sort of take it over really and start running it and managing everything? So I assumed the role as CEO, but I mean it was doing maybe a million and a half dollars or you, so it was a very small business at that point. And by then we had partners. We've always had partners actually. I think coming from a tech background that's always been very natural to me, right? I mean in tech you typically have lots of investors, lots of co-founders, et cetera, right? That typically brings to the table complementary skills and talents. So we had that. We had a CFO that owned a bit of the company for a while. We had a head of sourcing that owned a bit of the company for a while. So we were never alone. And fast forward to today where we have a private extant that owns roughly half of the company too. So yeah, we've always had partners. Coming into fashion, were you surprised, especially being in Denmark and it's a very vibrant fashion community, but it's small and I'm sure most of the businesses are family owned. Were you surprised that there wasn't more institutional money coming into it or that idea of having a lot of different investors and having people? One thing that I've noticed with American fashion startups is they rarely grant equity to the employees where in media startups or tech startups that's part of the compensation package. Were you surprised by how fashion worked in that way in terms of how people were investing their money and the resources of that money, et cetera? Lots of things surprised me about the fashion industry, but probably less that part. I mean, looking at it from the outside, I saw how that in many ways, the entry barriers are fairly low. A creative genius with a great sales kind of oriented sidekick can do great things. You can kind of put together amazing collections and if you sell it well, then suddenly you have a booming business. I'm not saying there's like tremendous challenges also, but you've seen that historically. So I was surprised by coming from a tech ecosystem that at least back then was very much kind of open all about sharing. It was kind of like a community driven effort. The fashion industry was quite the country. It was a lot about big egos and trying to look bigger than you were. I guess that comes with kind of building a brand and being cool and all of that. That bit surprised me definitely. I was also worried that looking at, especially in Scandinavia, I think a lot of brands made it kind of outside of Scandinavia, but mostly as a brand and very few businesses managed to also establish themselves kind of financially well. So I saw this kind of cycle where people would be kind of the new kid on the block. They co-talked about new brands, but they never managed to expand that into an international business and hence they never had like a sustainable financials behind it to back like long term survival. So that was my only kind of precondition for joining forces with my wife. That was that we tried to build an international business out of this. So really quickly, what happened to the original guy, the art and wine guy? Does he still have a stake in it or did you buy him out at some point or did someone buy him out? No, so he's kind of switched places with the finance guy and the sourcing guy at some point and they stayed with us for a while and they were then bought out by private equity at some point. So yeah, very kind of techy. But fashion is very emotional and usually again run by families. And so it's you kind of got into it right at the time when people like you were seeing consumer product and thinking, oh, this is a big opportunity too that the investment community has previously ignored. So when you got in there, give me your elevator pitch about how you change this business or how do you build this business? Because it was a tiny business and you're right. So many brands make like a million dollars a year and they are pretty big names in the fashion industry and you see their their P&L and you're like, oh, this isn't real. And there's so much of it is about social media and hype and building this myth that the numbers don't always match up with the story. How did you what did you do to get it from? I mean, you all make hundreds of millions of dollars a year now in revenue. How did you go from a million to a hundred million in like two sentences? I didn't know better, right? So I guess we basically built what resembled a tech company, right? So it was very much about like a fat hierarchy. It was a very lean and very agile business. We had a lot of like faith and talent. So whenever we came across great people, you'd bring them on board because in tech, talent is a scarcity, right? So you tend to recruit whoever wants to join you, right? As long as they're brilliant. I think we did the same thing. We also applied a lot of tools I took with me from the tech industry, like like Scrum and stuff like that, test small, fail fast kind of approaches, all of that. And I only kind of learned that later on when when Kataton acquired half the company, right? And part of their analysis was that they explained to us that we ran it basically like a tech company. So we did that without knowing it, right? But we also had like clear ideas as to how you build a brand and how you make it an international business. So a lot of that was about we had like this hierarchy where kind of product would be tier one and kind of branding and kind of telling the story around. It would be tier two sales would be tier three. And everybody else would be supporting those three layers, right? So it was all about product, all about telling the story. And then obviously selling the product. So and then we kind of insisted on being an international brand, right? So we'd rather say no to a lot of accounts. And I think that sounds a little bit like a cliche, but we actually did it. We pulled out of like massive high potential deals. We were never tempted at kind of going for scale too fast. We'd rather kind of build the international brand that we wanted to be and kind of sit next to brands that we aspire to bring up a good point about not scaling too fast. And what I've seen with people like you or people who have the tech mindset and do a morning stand up or scrum or whatever you want to call it. I've I've experienced many, you know, it's funny at fashion shows. They call the back when when people go back and interview the designer, the scrum. And I don't really understand why it doesn't. I've looked, I've like looked up the because I think of scrum as the tech scrum. But and and would just call that a backstage interview. But they call it the scrum, the like group of people that huddle around. It's very funny, parallel lives. But what I've seen with many people who maybe didn't even work in tech before, but have that tech mindset and raised from venture capital. A tech driven, scale driven venture capital in particular is that they focus too much on the technology. Like a great public example of this is when Glossier decided we are going to use a bunch of the money that we've raised to build an app, a community app where we'll be able to get data and that never launched. It didn't take off. They wasted all this money and it resulted at Glossier is doing very well now, but it resulted in a couple of years of having to like rejigger. Same thing has happened. You and I both know this, the replatforming of e-commerce sites, especially big multi-brand that can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and set people back. Those are just examples in the fashion and beauty industry. But there are many brands that have tried to launch in a more modern way and use the sort of methods of the tech world or the startup world and have failed. What do you think people aren't getting right? Like what did you take from that world and apply to fashion that made sense? And what wouldn't have made sense to do? Well, I think a lot of the tech place that raised, I mean, the tech fashion place that raised substantial venture money, they went for a direct to consumer business bottom, right? Which in its nature is somewhat fragile. So if your customer decision costs exceeds the lifetime value, then it's about business model, right? It's hard to overcome right. And if you only build brand like on a one to one basis compared to your marketing budget, then you're in for hard right. There is a we. So in our case, we opted for, I guess, an established business model kind of. We double down on all three channels like own stores, direct to consumer through e-commerce, but also through wholesale. And the wholesale channel helps you build a brand, right? It sits your brand in a context next to other great brands. It helps you market your brand. It also combined with like physical stores, it also kind of increases awareness of your brands because humans are tactile, right? You can only take it so far through kind of online advertising. At some point, you also want to touch the product or you want to engage with like people in your store or see the store for that matter and kind of embrace the full storytelling, right? So although we were tech driven, we still kind of went by a fairly traditional playbook. And I think that kind of saved us many times over because we had like different challenges that we could then prioritize or tone down dependent on market conditions.

Visit hello Alma.com to get started. That's hello a l m a.com. Hello Alma.com. Wholesale in Europe is different than wholesale in America. And I'm curious from how you approached it, were those wholesale relationships predominantly in Europe or Europe and Asia or how did you because wholesale in the European multi-brand retailers, department stores, I mean, they're challenged too, but it's, it tends to be a more straightforward business. A they do a lot of shopping shops. So there is a commission based model or a concession based model or whatever you want to call it. So it's a little bit more of a straightforward relationship. Whereas in America, it's just the, the retailers buy your stuff. A lot of times if they can't sell it, they mark it down like crazy or they also, but you have to buy it back. Like a lot of, a lot of brands have deals with retailers where if at the end of the season, if the product doesn't sold, the brand actually has to buy it back from the retailer. If the retailers even paid them for it. I know so many people right now for American department stores that are waiting for their spring money and the department stores are asking for pre-spring from, for January. So it's, it's a really complicated business. But how did you get, because I think a lot of young brands, if they have, if they have money, if a brand has money, because they have inherited wealth or backing from some very nice rich person or whatever. A lot of times they're wary of wholesale because they have the money up front. They can do direct to consumer, but you're right. And then the business doesn't grow as quickly or, and you don't get as much name recognition, but wholesale in the U S in particular, but also globally is such a tricky business. How did you approach it so that you weren't sort of owed money constantly and your cash flow was working early on? Yeah, you're right. There's definitely like generalizing. There's a difference in kind of how wholesale works in Europe compared to the U S like U S retailing can be a little overwhelming sometimes. Like there's, there's literally a lot of product on the floor, right? Like the good side to that is that the customer can hardly leave the store without having bought something because there's literally something for everyone. However, like the European model is a little more created and sometimes harder to access from a consumer's point of view. I think quite early on, we never had a business plan, but we had a vision that would guide our actions, right? And that kind of vision I could break down into quantifiable measures. And part of that would be like a list of the thousand stores globally that we wanted to work with. And a lot of those stores were like not even closely within our reach, right? But we just kind of insisted on that that was the end target. And then we kind of just rammed through and waited and had the patience until we got to engage with those guys. And I remember one day I was in London visiting Browns and our product was sitting in between the MANG and Chagmi. And I just knew there that was the end target. I just knew there that was a tender to prove that we somehow made it, right? It was a stepping stone onto whatever we ended up becoming. But that was kind of a major proof point for me that we've managed to establish ourselves for positioning the brand in exactly how we wanted it. It's so fascinating to me, the adjacencies at department stores. So where your brand is positioned says so much about what the department store thinks about you, how much you work to get in a certain position. Obviously, some of the stuff is paid when you see you go to Nordstrom and there are Louis Vuitton and Gucci stores, they're renting that space. That's a whole other business. But adjacencies in a retailer are so unique. And you saying it's Vettemont and Jack-O-Mouse says exactly what it is to me. Exactly what you were trying to achieve, which was original, fun design, but at a price that wasn't totally insane. And that's what you all did. And why I think, especially here in the US, you have managed to go, you're catching that audience, but then also the US is giant, a much broader audience of people who are just interested in pretty clothes or good looking clothes. And I see a lot of women wearing your stuff who aren't fashion obsessives, who maybe don't know what Vettemont is, who also wear Ghani. So that's pretty remarkable. I want to get into how you scaled further with the help of your private equity partners and all of that. But let's talk about why you wrote this book and also this element that we have not mentioned, the big S-word, sustainability, which is a big part of the Ghani business on a lot of levels. And for me as a reporter, I worked at Business of Fashion for a long time where they cover, Sarah Kent is their sustainability reporter. To me, she is the first word in this stuff. She is excellent. She's an incredible reporter. And she has been covering this market so closely. And I think Imran, the founder, had a real foresight to hire her early and have someone on that beat before any of the other publications were covering sustainability really closely. But the challenge with that word and with just the idea of being environmentally responsible in fashion is that A, making anything new, arguably, is not environmentally responsible. And B, people use this word sustainability in the most insane ways, including about things like diversity and inclusion. They'll have, they'll say sustainability and they'll say, we also mean diversity and inclusion in our sustainability list or whatever. It just completely makes no sense. And what has happened is a lot of greenwashing. So why did you all start caring about the environment? And how did that become a big part of the business? And how did it lead to you writing this book? Because I feel like it is a big reason you decided to do this book. Well, so the whole kind of interest, if I can put it that way, the climate change agenda is something I carried with me for more than 30 years, actually. And it was kind of, I started business economics and philosophy. And as part of that, I read about game theory, in particular, prison's dilemma. It's a mathematical way of kind of describing human behavior. And humans kind of come out as fairly opportunistic, right? And to me, that was just, and I'm sorry for having kind of a somewhat daunting perspective on humans, but it was, there's a certain truth to it, right? It resonated well with my experience. And also, I was starting very early versions of what could be called free peer auditing today, people profit, planet auditing. And through that, I read a lot about climate change. And I was just like, I kind of combine those two things. And I was like, whoa, man, I don't think we're ever going to solve this because like solving the climate crisis would mean that we would have to sacrifice short-term convenience, short-term materialistic convenience for longer-term gains, right? And we're just not capable of doing that because everything that we humans fought for the last 300 years or so, at least, is kind of adding that materialistic convenience to how we live our lives. And it makes total sense, like, if you come from a poor background in the global south, like the first thing you want to do once you start to make money is kind of upgrade your scooter to a car or buy a mobile phone. And it goes for me too. I mean, I want to fly to LA and experience that, right? So we're all kind of victims to that. And it's a hard sacrifice to make. And it's highly unlikely that we're capable of doing that. So I've kind of carried that idea with me throughout the years. And when I joined Gany, I frankly wasn't aware that the fashion industry is in a kind of very bad place when it comes to carbon footprint and all of that. But I kind of learned throughout the years. And then starting in 2013, we decided to double down on that topic and kind of dig it into what we did at Gany back then and are still doing. So that's the kind of background. It's still a super sensitive topic, right? Because nobody's doing enough. You can always argue that nobody's doing enough. Like the sheer fact of selling fashion, which is, like, a concept that plays on novelty, right? We live off of newness. And it's raw consumption. We don't need more clothes, right? So in that sense, you can never do well enough in this regard, right? So no matter how much you try, it's kind of sensitive. You're a sitting dog for criticism. And I totally get that. And that's why we've been careful not talking too much about it over the years. Yeah, they're not talking too much about it, especially when you actually are doing stuff is hard. And it's interesting if you look at the two big groups, Carin and LVMH and Hermes actually also, they all have very different ways. And Carin has been very transparent about they have someone who runs that business, who is a public spokesperson, that part of the business, all of their sustainability efforts, essentially. And LVMH for many years, didn't really say anything. And then they started to have to say something. And that just reflects like Carin is very open. And LVMH is very closed. And that's how they operate generally. But LVMH eventually did have to start to talk about it. They call it bio diversity. And then Hermes, they very rarely say anything. But a lot of these businesses in luxury in particular, have to be environmentally conscious or just the way they operate. In many cases, there's obviously a lot of things that they do that is not is not good. But in many cases, because of the way luxury works and how it's produced, they are already at a different level. Did you when you were sort of putting together the values and the strategies for Ghani, did you look at the luxury brands and how they managed their supply chains? Or were you looking outside of the industry? Or were you looking at fast fashion and Zara, which, you know, we think of fast fashion as being very bad for the environment, but Zara produces locally. So that's one thing that they do that. And they have a very, very supple supply chain or flexible supply chain. So there are things that they do right too. So I'm just curious, like, did you look at anyone in the industry and study how they operated to help you inform your own plan? You know, one of the best decisions we ever made at Ghani, and this doesn't pertain to sustainability necessarily, but overall how we ran the business was just kind of deciding not to navigate or inform our decisions around what other people were doing. Because it's just like what works for ARKNA Studios might not work for LVE, might not work for Inditex, right? There are different approaches, right? And for a while, we were trying to kind of build a brand and build our business modeled on what other people had succeeded in doing throughout the years. But at some point, we just decided to kind of stick to our own ideas and try not to look too much towards others, right? And the same thing with sustainability or responsibility as we like to refer to, we just kind of went our own way. So we doubled down on a couple of core principles that we still adhere to. Because the whole space is so difficult to navigate, you need to kind of decide on your own way and then stick to it. Like in the Mandalorian, like this is the way, right? You just got to repeat that. So we have a couple of sayings like we prefer action over perfection, right? And we'd rather be honest, not perfect, right? And it sounds like silly management cliches, right? But it actually works. We just want to make progress, right? And we can't wait for others to decide what is right for them. We just decide what is right for us. We set our kind of clear ambitions or targets, put them out there for others to judge, but also to kind of apply pressure to ourselves. And then we just kind of try to ram through and hope that we hit those targets. I never thought we'd have a baby Yoda quote on fashion people. So this is the way and is could be your mantra. And you decided to write a book about your way. So when did when were you like, I got to write a book about this and put it out on paper. And what did you want to because the thing about this book, I really think everyone should buy this book. It's it is no one knows how I am holding it up for some reason, like we're on TV, but no, no one knows. No one knows how to make money off of fashion, like one out of 10 people who run fashion businesses know how to make any money off of it, because they make silly mistakes, whatever. And you did. So I think it's if you want to run a fashion business, or you are running about fashion business, and you're one of these people who always needs another million dollars, I just need another million. Yeah, how many times if you and I have both heard this, this book is great because it just gives you and also running any business like it just gives you a framework of how someone did it. But why why did you want to write it and and put down your your way on paper? So the idea of writing a book, I guess, was kind of it's anchored in my background in tech. So I always knew I wanted to share the experiences that we had made. And hoping that others would kind of test them out, improve them, and then reshare, right, very much as you do in a tech ecosystem. And I'm just hoping because this is not perfect by any means, it's just our approach. And we just put it out there transparently. Hopefully, someone else will kind of find an even better way that we're going to accelerate the process towards kind of building more responsible, responsible businesses, right. So that's the basic idea. And then I mean, putting out a book is probably, in all honesty, that's probably also a little bit of vanity going on there, right? It's, it's, it's kind of cool having like a tangible physical thing out there. And hey, bear in mind, I, I, I couldn't write a book myself, right? So that's why I was talking to you and a couple of others a while back. And I ended up joining forces with the program, it's Islam, who also writes like, excellently about like fashion and technology. And yeah, well, I, we could have ended up with a ghost writer, right, and me shining and looking like I wrote the book, but that would not be in the spirit of Gany, right. So, uh, look at I co-authored the book, which means that she wrote most the words, right? And I provided the ideas and, uh, yeah, it's basically me hoping that the, the, the ecosystem overall will come out in a better place once some people have read it and improved upon it. So congrats to Brooke also. This is a big accomplishment. As someone who just finished a book with a co-author, it's, it's just as hard when it's two people. Let me just say that.

My name is Nicole Carroll, and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out it was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th. Follow and listen on Apple podcasts, the Odyssey app, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcast. So I wanted to go over a couple of the points you made within the book. Your first chapter title is, we are all hypocrites and you say you are bound to act in a self-serving way, at least part of the time. To me, that is an attempt at self-awareness and what you're talking about. All of this, like you want to go through your life fairly self-aware because I assume you think that that will have better results. But why did you want to hard launch the book with that idea? It's a tough conversation, right? It's just that, and I gotta be careful, it doesn't come out looking like greenwashing. But I guess my point is just that we are all part of this system, right? And I don't believe that we have time for like a revolution and a new kind of way of building societies to prevail, right? We need to kind of accept the cultural concepts and the capitalism that's here and kind of apply those principles to hopefully kind of improve the current situation, right? So it's just kind of my way of saying that there's no escaping what we're doing. I mean, for many years, I didn't have a car. I bought my first car when I was 41, right? I've been a vegetarian, I've been flexitarian, I've been pescetarian, now I'm back to eating meat, maybe not red meat, but like all kinds of meat. And but at the same time, I'd fly anywhere, right? To kind of continue my business. I live in a house that's way bigger than most people's houses. I mean, I'm totally guilty of kind of contributing to the overall system and there's no escaping that, right? I just remember it, I've been to your house, it's very nice. It's not, it's not crazy. It's really beautiful. It's a lovely house though. I mean, I think the house you went to, we shared with a friend in like two communal style. But yeah, we're in another house further down the road. So there's really no excuses there. And I mean, I actually, at one point, I kind of offered my story to a friend who was doing TV on kind of like the Danish version of national TV, to kind of just put it out there, how, how kind of how hard it is, although you mean well, and do well in some circumstance, under some circumstances, you're still kind of totally guilty and you cannot kind of escape that. So we need to leave that behind us. It also touches upon the question that I'm often asked, obviously, and that is, why don't you just shut down your business? It's fashion is so bad and you care so much about the climate. And I've been over that argument over and over again, obviously. And I've always, I always end up with the conclusion that that whole idea of degrowth just doesn't make sense. Or at least I'm not kind of clever enough to get my head around what the consequences would be like. I mean, if we weren't growing and making money, investments wouldn't flow into the technology that needs to save us that I'm totally convinced of that. So that leads me to conclude then that fashion is here to stay. And I might as well kind of stay in it and then do better than most of my peers when it comes to responsible behavior. And then kind of take market share away from those that aren't doing as well, right? Until then, the day where other people are doing better than me, then maybe I should consider shutting down the business. What is the one thing that you all have done around environmental responsibility that you feel like has been had the biggest effect on the business? We try also always to kind of map out our activities along two parameters. So there's some activities that creates a lot of awareness, right? That are educational and fun and easy to relate to, right? But sometimes they don't have impact, which is the other parameter, right? So impact, high impact, low awareness can be also mapping out our entire supply chain, right? It's pretty boring, sorry. And it's a full time job for someone for a year or more, right? High impact, but low on awareness, hard to relate to other people. But then on the other hand, we grow oyster mushrooms in our canteen on the coffee grounds from our espresso machine. It looks super pretty, like you can literally, it's Instagram friendly and all of that, right? So there's a lot of awareness, right? It's easy to relate to, but it has zero impact. So but when you talk about pure impact, I think the biggest contribution we've made is kind of bringing down our carbon footprint by 7% in absolute terms compared to our baseline, which is 2021. Our ambition is to reduce our carbon footprint in absolute terms by 50% with 21 as a baseline in 2027, right? And looking back the past two years, we've been growing on average 18% since 2021, but managed to reduce our carbon footprint by 7%. That's a major achievement for me, especially being in the fashion industry. And I know it will continue throughout this year. And a lot of that is derived from the fact that we've managed to implement a lot of innovative new materials. And it sounds kind of simple, but that's involved like a massive effort. It's a project that we call Fabrics of the Future, where we constantly monitor around 30 different new innovative materials with a better climate footprint than the conventional alternatives. And we try to help these brands kind of understand what we require from them as a brand in terms of like scalability, performance, durability, look and feel, price point, etc., etc., educating them on what it takes to become a viable business, right? And ultimately, we see them graduate along the way, right? We help them get into the market. Yeah, so that would be probably one of the achievements that I appreciate the most. So in the book, you talk about being an insecure overachiever. What exactly does that mean to you? And why has that been helpful in terms of running a business and driving success? So obviously, it has got nothing to do with the diagnosis of like being paranoid. It's a term or concept I kind of took from consulting, basically. And it describes very well how my wife and I work. And it basically means that you are a little insecure about your abilities. And you kind of compensate for that insecurity by working harder, basically. So that type of personality is awesome to have on your team. It's terrible when you are that person. And both my wife and I are like that, right? So it's something we don't mind talking about, but it's actually somewhat sensitive, right? It's not easy being that person. I understand. So you and Dita have a very unique partnership. A, you've been working together for all these years and you've built this giant business. How do you manage it? How do you manage your life and your work and life is work and all of that? And what do what, because she's the creative, you're the creative executive. And what's your dynamic like at work, at least? And how have you managed to do this without totally driving each other nuts? Yeah, it's a good question. I mean, first of all, we do very different things. Right. So as you mentioned, Dita does creative stuff and she's extremely good at that, but she can also be commercial at the same time. So she's a pretty unique breed in that sense. And I respect her big time for that. I'm more on kind of analysis, strategy, execution, operations, that sort of things. And she doesn't understand or have no interest in that. So she's kind of totally appreciates me for doing that. And I think it obviously it starts there, right? So we could go to work even when it was a small company and not see each other throughout the day, right? So she'd go about doing what she did, I'd go about doing what I did. And then we kind of grew with it. Like we had certain rules in place, like we'd never talk business after eight o'clock, right? Because we wanted to avoid that situation where you had something that were wearing you down, right? Throughout the day, you'd think about some shitstorm or somebody that was leaving the company or whatever. And it would be a huge problem. And then once you got home at night, you'd mention it to your wife, and you'd be kind of relieved and have passed on that issue to her. And she would be kind of thinking it over all throughout the night. That situation, you want to avoid that by all means, right? So we had this one basic rule that we'd never talk business after eight o'clock at night. And that helped us, obviously. And then I think, like, as things evolve, we kind of grew like a profound respect for each other. And I've seen a lot of like, people my age, my situation were like, one part of a couple has been working a lot more than the other, right? The other kind of looked after the home. 20 years later, they're totally relevant to each other, right? And they end up splitting. And we've definitely avoided that. We're totally dependent on each other. I wouldn't know what to do without my wife. And she, she claims at least that she wouldn't know what to do without me either. Right. So we've kind of built that dynamic in between us. And that's proven to be very strong, right? And it has helped us through a lot. Yeah, it's interesting. I am also at the age where people are realizing they have nothing in common with their partner. And what I do think having some sort of professional connection and understanding our interest in each other's work helps with that. And then also just so many people are like, Oh, when the kids leave, I'm gonna split. Which is, it's just interesting. But if, if you, you have to keep turning into each other. So you guys just get to do it every day, 24 hours on all these different levels. Maybe you should write a marriage book next. Yeah, maybe. And, but also bear in mind, like, by all means, can it turn out to be a success? I don't know where we'd ended up if we'd gone bankrupt at some point. Well, you didn't. So, so you don't need to worry. One, one thing that you all have done. And, and this is, I think a real testament to your partnership is you have a whole chapter about creating quote unquote, shit hot product. And one big mistake I see a lot of brands make is it's not product first. And I see this really big heritage brands that have that do sell a lot of, they ship a lot of product to retail, they sell a lot because their name is so big. But sometimes product doesn't come first. And then three years later, you see it just all at Marshall's or or TJ Maxx or TK Maxx or whatever. So they, they haven't made the product first. How, how do you engineer a shit hot product? I mean, it's not, it's not totally science. There is some art to it. How do you all approach product development? And when did you realize you were onto something? Obviously, Dita is, is a great designer and that's a huge part of it. But how did, when did you realize, okay, though, our sort of formula for doing this does work in mass or, or close to in mass? Yeah, it's a, that's a hard one to explain, right? Because there's definitely some degree of pixie dust involved here, right? There's the X factor. And you just can't put that on formula, right? If you, and you have, I mean, anybody who's read the history of your right, would know that like sometimes a genius just shows up and kind of outperforms every conception of what is fashion, right? And, and I thought that I'm compared Dita to, to Dior necessarily, but she does have that X factor. By all means, it's not just creatively, but it's also because kind of she grew up in retail. She was a buyer for many years. So she totally understands also, the woman she designs for or the customer she designs for. So she has that very unique combination of somebody that can be extremely creative by like the same time kind of having as respect for commercial demands, right? At the same time, Gany has always been a team effort, right? And that's probably also why it's called Gania and not Dita. So we've always kind of listened to everyone on the team, everybody got to weigh in, everybody got to wear the pros, making sure that they would fit any kind of figure. So it's always been this communal effort, I don't know if that's particular for Gany or if just it's by due to the fact that we're based in Denmark, which is by all means a socialist country, right? And we're various consensus driven and it might also play in, right? So that bit is hard to put on formula. However, we've always been good at prioritizing raw creativity and preserving that, like putting up a framework that would support the creative processes in the company. That might offer part of the explanation, but there's definitely a little bit of magic involved, right? Yeah. And I think the lesson there that I take away is that you have to figure out who you are as a person and what you're capable of and then build your business around that. Whereas I think a lot of designers and just people who own fashion businesses tend to want to, they see success and they want to replicate it. And that doesn't work if you don't have the same strengths. So you have to figure out what your strengths are and build the product around those strengths. And then you will have, it doesn't always work because there are so many factors, but if everybody who is a stakeholder is like playing up their strengths and focusing on them, it tends to come together pretty nicely. Whereas many people see a formula and they say, oh, I'm just going to copy that. It worked. It clearly works. And then they fail. Completely right about that. And I think at like from a very early stage, we had a clear idea as to the GANI DNA. We knew what we wanted to create. We were all about kind of conscious. Like I remember like this girl wearing a lace dress with sneakers and a t-shirt. And she was all kind of shaped and had like tattooed eyes in her neck. And it was back in the early days, there was just so much the essence of like the girl we were trying to design for. It was so kind of so much about contrast and the dynamic that comes from the friction we wanted to create. And then bear in mind, we also grew up with Instagram. And we were quite early on in kind of embracing that and understanding that you could create the world's greatest product. But if you didn't kind of tell the story around that, then nobody would notice. So we always thought about kind of the brand marketing as a patchwork of content bits. I think today, that's probably evident to everybody that that's the way to go about it. But back then, we would make sure that if we hosted a dinner at our house, like even the cocktails that were provided by an ex actor and her boyfriend, they were also models kind of like it was all weaved into this patchwork of a storytelling that would ultimately convey this message of the brand that we were trying to be. I remember kind of this is still the emperor's new clothes in sometimes right this industry, right? Yeah, I mean, I remember looking at like, with one creating the DHL t-shirt that probably retailed at $300 or something like that back then. And I'd be amazed as to how you could kind of do stuff like that. It's extremely powerful, but dependent on your perspective, also a little ridiculous, right? Or the rego and show, I think it was SS 2016 were kind of models were wearing models upside down or women were wearing women upside down, right? And I mean, I had lots of friends that went to that show and were kind of in tears, because it was so powerful, right? But at the same time, I got a lot of like memes from my tech friends that would be like, meanwhile, in the world of fashion, right? And then ask me what the F is going on, right? With you guys. So, but I mean, we totally embrace that it's the storytelling part of it that that you need to be serious about. Because, right, you need to create a context about what you do. Otherwise, nobody will understand it. So I wanted to talk about the investor bit for a moment, because you, you, as you said, there were investors from the beginning, and you weren't afraid of that because you came from tech. The thing with fashion is you need investors to be able to expand because retail, physical retail, owning your own stores or running your own stores is extremely expensive. And so you need the capital to be able to do that. If you want to make a bigger, I don't, I guess impact isn't the right word, but if you want to be well known, at some point, you're going to have to raise a significant amount of money. And in 2017, you all partnered with El Caterton, which is a very big private equity firm linked with LVMH, but it used to be Caterton and L, I forget what it was called, but they combined. And it was something else, it was something to do with LVMH. But Caterton and LVMH combined to make El Caterton. They are very known for taking brands that are like, I don't know, 40 to 100 million and scaling them to 500 or a million, a billion. And then either, I don't know if they've had a few IPOs like Birkenstock is a great example, or selling to a strategic. And they, I don't know if they've actually sold any of their businesses to LVMH. I don't think they have, but obviously when they acquire something, it's something that people think about. So the idea is you IPO, or after you do a private equity, it's IPO or strategic. Why did you partner with them at that time? Because you were what almost 10 years into the business at that point. Why were they the right partner? And what have they allowed you to do over the last five to seven years? I guess it's seven years now. Well, I mean, actually, we never took in investors before them because like I had other partners, but they kind of joined with a little pocket money, not a big investment, but more so working along along us, right? So that was more kind of like the tech idea of having like co-founders with complementary skills, right? But then we just got to a point where we need to kind of clean up the cap table. So somebody wanted to sell and we wanted to continue. So we found like an ideal partner for that someone that's kind of well established in the industry and in those things and out of the industry, right? And they kind of basically bought out the early partners that I had. I mean, and but part of our selling, but also back to kind of me and my wife kind of funding the whole thing and being insecure over cheapers, right? You are, although you were very successful, you're still the type of person that that's having a hard time kind of taking a step back and then appreciating what you've achieved. It's rather the more successful you are, the more insecure you are about what you're doing, the more fragile we feel the whole thing is because you you convince yourself you can only fail, right? So that's why I I we really felt like we needed a partner that couldn't support us on like our continued growth. And so in all honesty, that was totally part of that. And also in all transparency, we like from a financial point of view, we had better offers on the table. But but we really wanted to work with Elcadarton because of the skills they brought to the table. And in particular, the lead partner on the deal, like was like proved to have like extensive knowledge of the industry. So they convinced us but hey, I was also a little kind of tempted because of their affiliation with LVMH, although it's indirect, right? So there was also that going on totally rational. But it's not irrational because every time I write about them, I mentioned that they're linked to LVMH. So in a way, it's another way of storytelling and creating a perception around the brand. So and I also if I know they're investing in something, I mean, they've had a lot of good outcomes. So that's part of it. But I'm also like, it feels a little more safe for a fashion brand to be with them than with a PE firm that has not done any fashion. Safe but definitely also sounds way cooler, right? Yeah. So so what has the experience been like the last seven years? Like, obviously, you've grown tremendously. And I'm not going to ask you but there have been reports in the market the last couple years that you all might sell again to someone else. You don't need to comment on that. But you could just look up all the internet, just Google it. There's like five stories about it. But what have you been able to achieve because you had that investment? And what does the business look like now that you are a giant brand, especially for like thinking for scale in this era where there are brands that make $20 billion a year and there are brands that make $5 million. And there's not a lot in between. And you're a big brand in the grand scheme of things. But you're still independent. You're still you're not part of a strategic group. You've done something that like a lot of other companies have not been able to do in the last decade. Oh, yeah, thank you. I mean, we're big brands. I'm continuously amazed by that. And I say that in all kind of honesty. But I mean, I go to weird places on the planet and meet people that know and love the brand. I'm still amazed by that. I really appreciate that. But on the other hand, we're not like a massive business. So it's been an interesting journey. But hey, I mean, when we were kind of we owned the business ourselves, we were kind of owner managed. And when you're owner managed, you're somewhat risk averse, right? There's a limit to how much you dare to invest them stuff or how expensive people you dare to bring on board, right? Because it's your own money literally. So we ran a very lean, very cool business. We were growing substantially. But at the same time, it was also somewhat of a homegrown business, right? And by kind of bringing El Caterton on board, we kind of we got the guts to kind of bring on board very experienced executives that we wouldn't otherwise dare to. And it was a big investment for us, but it also professionalized the old world business. Also, due to their background and how powerful they are, how well established they are in the market, we also managed to attract a different type of talent, right? A more senior type of talent. So that's been a massive contribution to the business that we now can attract like an executive layer or other kind of layers of key people to the business that has kind of added a lot of professionalism to the business. So it's a much more kind of well run machine and it's less dependent on individuals and more kind of an organization, right? So I mean, I really appreciate the contribution that we've had from them. And hey, I don't mind commenting on the kind of the will eventually be another transaction sometime. I mean, private equity is about buying and selling companies. So that there's no secret there. However, I try to completely stay out of it and just stick to what I do. And that sounds like a good way to be. Yeah, sounds a little too easy, right? So what are you working on right now? What is sort of the focus for you for the next year with the business and what parts of the business, what's been challenging being this big? Like this isn't an easy, as we like to say in fashion, trading environment. So what is, what are you focused on making better in the next year or so? So overall, the business is doing surprisingly well. I mean, of course, there are challenges here and there. I mean, as you say, like the overall environment is very kind of, it's a little sour here and there, right? Especially kind of wholesale, we all know how the big online us are doing. And it's not easy times in that sense, right? But that aside, we're actually like growing soundly. And I think we are finally kind of profit from on a global scale that we become this brand that we are. So really no complaints there. From my perspective, I completely doubled down on our responsibility strategy. We have very, very ambitious targets out there. Like the most ambitious target is kind of reducing our carbon footprint by 50% in 2027. And that's where I spend most of my time, because that requires us kind of launching a lot of new initiatives, bringing on board a lot of like new innovative material suppliers. And I love that kind of combination of embracing new technology and kind of embedding that into the core of of an established and in many ways kind of conservative business model, right? So it's a huge challenge, but it's also extremely motivating. I've taken up too much of your time. But if there's one thing that you want people to take away from the Ghani Playbook available in stores, I think it'll already be available once we do this, once this goes live. But if there was one thing, what is it that you want people to know? It's definitely that there's a lot you can do in kind of creating a more responsible business. There's a lot of low hanging fruit. It's easier than you think. It's more a matter of just kind of doing it, right? And I'm hoping that we can install this idea in the reader's mind. I advocate for getting rid of the word sustainability and just using responsibility. So I like this this way of storytelling that you this path you're on. Nicolai, thank you so much. This was so great. And I really love the book and appreciate what you all are doing and look forward to whatever comes next. It's super fun to write about and it's been a pleasure following the Ghani trajectory. Thank you so much, Lauren. I really, really appreciate you having me here. And I so much look forward to reading your book, selling sexy when it comes out. We've been talking about it for a while. Oh yeah. Thank you so much for for shilling for me. It comes out October 8th, but you can pre-order. I'll be sure to pre-order it. Thank you. Thank you, Nicolai. I hope I see you soon.
