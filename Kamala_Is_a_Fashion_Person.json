Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Pucks Fashion and Beauty Memo Line Sheet. And today with me on the show is the Wall Street Journal's executive fashion director, Rory Saterin. We're talking LACMA, Kamala, Martha, Fieldcoats, Mark Jacobs, and so, so much more. Let's get started. Hey everyone, hope you're having a great week. Today is election day here in the US. I had a couple of friends come over from Paris on Sunday night for dinner, and they were like, why isn't anyone talking about the election? And I said to them, welcome to America. Like in Europe or anywhere, the first thing you sit down, you talk about everything that's happening in the world for 20 minutes. And then you talk about work or friends or love life and all that stuff. It's not how it is in America. We all know that. I know some of you are like that, but not a lot of the people that I'm hanging out with. Anyway, it's good to be back in Los Angeles, but I had a really good time in New York last week. I went really hard on eating out, and we went to this very fun and kind of funny. Place in meatpacking on Saturday called Shea Margo. It's one of these private members' clubs, that guy, Kyle Hodgkis Carone, who many of you are probably friends with, who's like a hospitality guy in the West Village. He is the guy behind it. He was around making sure everything was okay. It's interesting because like the interiors were all red, red lacquer walls. Apparently they had like repainted them right before it opened to make them perfect. Something connected to like the interiors were done by like the same designer, the design group that did Annabelle's in London. I think there's a Vogue story and then she could probably get all the details. But anyway, it's like very, if you've been to Annabelle's, has that sort of vibe. There's like a lot to look at. I suspect it'll become like very popular place for fashion events and parties. We had a great time. We were staying in the West Village, so it was nice to be close. And the service was impeccable. Hilariously, so John George is the chef and he was at the table next to us the whole night. Just like pouring tap water for these people. I have no idea who they were. I tried really hard to figure it out. We did see people we knew and then I also like saw on Instagram, there were people that we knew there. But we were just, it was like me, my husband, my friend Jodi and we were just hanging out. And it was, we had such a nice time. Like I'm not going to be a member there. I don't think they would take me, but it was really fun to go for the night. So thanks to the people who sorted that out for us. I appreciate it. And New York was great. I was really glad I got to see so many of you. I'm even happier to be back in LA and back to my normal life for a little while until I get bored again. On Monday online, I've got the latest of what's happening at Chanel. It sounds like, you know, there is going to be an announcement someday. It probably won't be this week, but it will happen. And I talked a little bit about like how they've been recruiting generally within the business and how that reflects, you know, what they might do with that role. And Rachel Sturgaetz is back with a Goop update. It seems like they have had yet another restructuring that resulted in the elimination of pretty much everyone in editorial and not everyone. Rachel will have all the details you can get if you pay for Line Sheet. The content of Commerce Man, it's not what you think it is. Like it's not, I think a lot of people think you have great content. You're going to be able to make a lot of money like pushing people to the commerce. And it just, it does happen, but it's not that kind of dry. So it's tough this anyway. Check it out. And I hope you enjoy this conversation with Rory. We really covered a lot of that. That's good. Rory Sattron, welcome to Fashion People. Thanks for having me, Lauren. I'm so excited that you're here. We have, we have a lot to discuss. So we saw each other last week at, I think probably just at Innovators, the big event that you and your crew hosted at the MoMA on Tuesday night. I had a great time. How was it for you? You've worked at the journal for what, like seven or eight years? Seven years. Yeah. So, no, we loved having you. It was so fun to see you there. It was great. I don't know. I mean, the cool thing about Innovators is always the sort of cross-pollination, like seeing people from sports and business and fashion and art kind of all together. And this year we had a nice little press contingent as well. So that was super fun. Yeah. I thought it was smart of you all to invite, like there was reporters from the Times, Amanda and E. Fair and, and all these different outlets that are like kind of competitive or whatever. But there was so much. There was a lot to write about. Like I didn't even write about Selma Hayek's speech in my write-up, which was very funny and interesting. She did get to a point. It took a little while, but like that was something Aubrey Plaza made like a point about the rally that happened, the Trump rally on Sunday. There were like all these little news moments. And I thought what was really interesting is like everybody was super, super famous. But as you said, like from all these different industries, and it felt like a newspaper party, like, which I don't know if I've ever been to a newspaper party before, but it felt like it was glamorous, but it wasn't, they weren't there because they're glamorous. They were there because they're interesting. And that's like what you all have to do in your coverage all the time is cover these really glamorous people, but talk about them. Like what is actually interesting about them, not just how they look or how they present themselves or the kind of underlying of what that all means. Totally. Yeah. Well, that's a huge compliment. And you probably haven't been to that many newspaper parties because there aren't very many newspaper parties, especially kind of well-funded, glossy, big Gallup events like this. It's kind of one of the last ones standing. Yeah, it was so it was super fun. The food was good. I was very impressed. What is like what were your best dressed if you had a couple people that you thought looked really good? I mean, I'm a big Sophia Coppola stand. I'm always looking at what she's wearing. And I loved her sort of rump old black satin T-shirt with kind of dark pants. Actually, that's one of my three questions before I buy something is would Sophia Coppola wear this? Would I wear it tonight? And do I have something that fulfills this task already in my wardrobe? So like if I have a dark highway, so Jean, I can't buy another one. So yeah, so seeing her was awesome. But Charlie XCX looked great with the backless black. I think it was Salaron. What about you? Well, really quickly on the Sophia Coppola thing, I also have been through phases where I would say that it's kind of like what would Jesus do? But it's like what would Sophia Coppola do? And I would say like I go I have been flow. But the last few years I have returned to her hardcore as as my guiding light. But that's a really smart way to think about shopping. I try to do like a one in one out. But that idea of like, do you have something that will already serve this purpose? Because I do find myself just repeating the same pant over and over again, because it serves all the purposes. I thought Sarah Paulson looked great. She was also at the Mark Jacobs table with Sophia. I thought that some of it looked really good in Balenciaga. It was this beautiful lipstick pink color that I just really liked. And and she looked great. And I thought that what was sort of more interesting, I thought the SNL people looked good. Like it's more interesting sometimes to see what the people who don't necessarily have the access to the designers or don't aren't as interested in fashion. Where? So that it was fun. I thought that your boss, Emma, looked your boss, boss, boss, Emma looked really great. She was wearing the Saint Laurent Silver of Pomson. I mentioned it in my story, but I thought she looked she looked good for editor in chief of a newspaper. It was very impressive. But yeah, I thought it was I also thought you looked great and put you as a best dressed. You had on this a lie address in sort of plum color that I own in essentially Tiffany Blue, which is we're both. Like black and navy people, but I love this dress so much. It tell me why you bought this dress and explain the dress to everybody and what makes it so special. Thanks, Laura, but so nice. I mean, it's it's kind of body con, I guess it's very for us. Yes. Yeah. Extremely body con. I definitely went outside of my comfort zone to not wear black, which I think I identify with that. I don't know. I mean, on a journalist's salary, it takes a lot for me to walk into a store and buy something. I buy a lot at sample sales. I buy a lot on the real world. But I think Alaya is having this kind of magic moment right now where you sort of just want to be part of it. I think the last similar kind of. Yeah, I mean, I think Phoebe Filo for Celine, I would do that. I would go into the store seasonally and buy a few special things, but it's been a while and it's kind of fun to like a brand that much. I would agree. I was looking. I had some friends over from Paris last night. We were looking through my clothes because they wanted to know like what I actually owned. And I still own and wear a good amount of the Phoebe stuff that I bought that most of it deeply on sale. But there was a blazer that I took to New York last week that I got for it was still ridiculously expensive. It was probably like her second or last season, second to last or last season. But I still wear it constantly. A pair of I have probably two or three pairs of the trousers. But yeah, I had a similar experience. I went to the showroom in Paris in February, the Alaya showroom. And afterwards, the showrooms above the store. And I went down to the store and I was going to try on because I had bought the first thing I bought was a blazer or a jacket. Over the holidays that was very deeply discounted. And I was looking for the right pair of pants and I thought, well, maybe, you know, with the vat, with the discount, all that stuff. I'll buy a pair of pants to match the blazer. And I went downstairs, I tried on pants and then the person, of course, was like, you should try on some dresses. And I thought, oh, what the heck? And I tried on this black dress that I also wore last week. And it was just, I don't know about you, but I don't wear shapewear because it, I don't think it's flattering. It's uncomfortable. I'm just not a shapewear person. But I tried this dress on and I was like, oh my God, I don't have to wear bra. I don't have to like worry about anything. It I look great. And and I like worked it out in my head. I said, I have all these events this year. I'll have the end. It's a pretty classic Alaya style. It's like a sleeveless crew neck, not super sexy or anything below the knee, but just an hourglass shape. And I bought it straight out. And, you know, compared to what it cost in America, it was a steal. And then this summer, I don't know. I was just looking on Neiman Marcus or something and that dress, which it's it has a lot of ruching. It has a high neck, like a mock neck almost. And it's above the elbow sleeve. And they had it in black and blue on Neiman Marcus. And I thought that blue is just so pretty. And I bought a bathing suit this summer in that color. And I thought it looked good. And I thought, again, I have like so many events and things in the fall. Maybe I should just try it. And I bought it and I was just like, again, it just makes you look like a different person. And it really is sort of the power of transformative clothes and also, unfortunately, like spending money on clothes, because we think of this stuff as being really overpriced, but in many cases, when it comes to clothing itself, like the margins aren't as great as on handbags and things like that. And it's worth it to buy. I always say this to you. I mean, buying a lie dress is is an extreme version, but like buy the thing that you want and just wear that all the time. Like I've worn both of those dresses, I think three or four times this year, each already. And like I have a Loewe dress that I bought probably in 2017 or 18. And I wore it to events for three years straight. And I and I pulled it out last night to show my friends and and they were also like, oh, this dress is still really good. But it does just sort of speak to the power of what he's doing at Alaya. And and if people who don't who, you know, buy one or two things a season, not seventy five are buying it and are getting stuff for free are buying it, then it it means something for sure. Totally. Yeah. No, it's true. Buy the thing that you completely love and you'll wear it to death. That's true. That's kind of always true of my innovators dress. Last year, I bought the Prada nylon nightgown. The black, which is so great because you can wipe it clean with a sponge. Little known fact. But yeah, no, I've worn it several times since then, but I'm a huge, huge fan of Peter Mueller and everything he's doing. I never I didn't think about that with the Prada nylon stuff. I bought a safari dress from there this summer that that's good to good to remember that you can just clean it up yourself and not dry clean only and save money that way. So this is coming out on Election Day. Great for us. People are going to need distractions, but you had an interesting piece this weekend and you were I I'm excited to chat with you because you were really the first person to cover Kamala Harris in her clothes. Like you had the first really big story on how she dresses back in, I don't know, I guess like pre maybe even pre pre-Biden. But you you wrote this weekend about her jeans that she was wearing out and about. Can you tell me how you see the evolution of her her style and culminating with these jeans in the last stretch of fundraising and is that called what they're doing? Campaigning. What you think it meant? Yeah, I mean Kamala's worn jeans before she wore them on the cover of Vogue in 2021. That was kind of like a skinnier Jean. That was the earlier silhouette she liked that she would always wear with her beloved chucks like her low converse and it was with a blazer as well. So she's had these kind of moments of casual style. There's the famous photo of her at San Francisco Pride wearing the rainbow sparkly jacket. So she's had these kind of moments of relatability or sort of dressing down. But in general, we know Kamala wears this like extremely consistent kind of uniform of the sleek suit. So it's like style that she honed as as a lawyer as an attorney general. It really syncs up with a lot of the female lawyers that I know, you know, who really want the message to be on what they say and not what they're wearing. And I would say since August, her style has gotten even sleeker, even leaner. This has been kind of the period that she's working with. Leslie Fremar, that's still not confirmed, but everyone knows it's true. I'm sure Leslie has signed every NDA known to man. So yeah, I mean, when the PRs just are like, we're not going to talk about it, it means it's true. Yeah, I think it's pretty much, you know, we're all it's true. But, you know, she's really whittled down Kamala's style to this like very precise kind of perfect distillation of what she was already wearing. I mean, or she's worn more European designers, which I've also written about. There has been Dior. There's been a lot of Chloe. So I think like any aberration from the standard uniform is notable. And the past few weeks, she has worn this like high-waisted dark bootcut jean. I don't know what brand it is. If anyone knows, please let me know. Looks kind of like a J brand. I have a pair of genericas. It looks a little bit like a generica, but I don't know. I mean, she's, you know, she's in the swing state. She's trying really hard to be relatable. So I think it makes sense that she would be dressing down slightly. I will say that, you know, her campaign does not want the focus to be on her clothes. And I think that's apparent in what she wears, especially recently. There's been nothing kind of that sticks out overly. It's kind of like, like when you buy a black Prius so that your car doesn't say anything about you. Okay. Well, your car still says something about you. So that's sort of how I feel about Kamala. The fact that she's dressing in this very don't look at me way says something else. Yeah. Well, the other thing is it's, it's still very appealing. So she's not wearing the traditional politician brands. The like go to those sort of Carlisle collection type things that or a lot of Ralph, like she has worn some Ralph Lauren, but like that sort of became Hillary Clinton's thing. But she doesn't look like she's dressing like a politician. I'd say she looks like she's dressing like a lawyer. And that part of it is very interesting. Like these jeans, I have no idea what, what brand they are, but it's funny. A, the boot cut is, it is a little bit of a fashion statement. And I was at La Garcelle when I was in New York last week and I saw a couple of women wearing jeans like this. And I actually got a pair of jeans like this at Scout, the vintage store in LA recently, which is it is a little bit moving away from what, you know, people in the middle of the country are probably mostly still wearing skinny jeans. So the other thing that I think is interesting is it is all nice. Like it doesn't, she wears Irene Neworth jewelry a lot. She also wears Tiffany jewelry on many occasions. You mentioned the Chloe suits, which I feel like have been the most notable suits that she's worn. And it's just interesting. Like I hope someday Leslie's able to tell the story of why she decided to work. Maybe she's friends with Shamena. I don't, the Chloe designer who some people pronounce her name, Shemana, but I don't, her friends seem to say Shamena. So I, I don't know. So it's an interesting thing of like, you're totally right. Because they look nice. It's not as jarring as if it was like a really brightly colored suit or just something a little bit more severe. There's something very soft about them. And it's an interesting approach. And I think it's been perfect. Like I don't, I don't want her to wear Monse like Michelle Obama did at the Democratic National Convention. Michelle Obama looked amazing in that suit sold like crazy for that brand. I'm so happy for them. She's really into fashion fashion and that's her personality. And so it makes sense on her. If Kamala was wearing that kind of stuff, that's all anyone would be talking about. And that's not, not what we want. So it's interesting for people are tracking it really closely like you to have to write about those small nuances and you sort of compared it to the work vest that Trump was wearing, which reminded me of the Gile Jean in, in Paris a little bit. Definitely. I mean, that was kind of sure they wouldn't like that comparison, but that's what it reminded me of. Yeah. No, I mean, Trump is still wearing his Brioni suit every day. He has a uniform. I picture his closet to be at the sort of Patrick Bateman thing where it's like identical suits, identical ties, and he just chooses one. The putting on the garbage man vest, putting on the McDonald's apron is it's more like a prop that you're putting on rather than an actual style choice, like it is with Kamala and the jeans, but she's in uncharted territory. You know, I try hard not to compare her to First Ladies when I write about her because it's a very different job. But at the same time, sometimes that's the only thing you have to compare her to because there hasn't been a woman in that position yet. So, you know, I have compared her to Joe Biden who does, as you say, wear a lot of Ralph Lauren when I spoke about whether or not she should be wearing more American designers. The real parallels were First Ladies at Jackie Kennedy when she got blasted for wearing French designers and then had to shift to Oleg Kasini. So, yeah, I mean, I think one of the things that really outsther as a fashion person is her shoes. You know, she always wears Manolo Blanix. They're always very high, like a 105 millimeter heel, very pointy. She does like the boot is kind of her casual shoe, the super high pointy boot, but a lot of pumps, a lot of BB pumps, and those are hard to walk in and she does it. Yeah, I love Manolos, but I have fairly wide feet and they just, they're not like wide, wide, but I have issues with Manolos. I love them, but it's hard for me to wear them on a regular basis. So good for her. Sure. She has beautiful feet. It's a very narrow toe box. Yeah. Yes. Very narrow toe box. If you wear Birkenstocks a lot, you're pretty much ruined and can't wear. Manolo.

So one thing that was distracting a lot of us this weekend from thinking about the election, because, you know, everybody who's listened to this podcast who's an American citizen has already voted, was the Martha Stewart documentary. Which I, we were chatting a bit beforehand and I mentioned I unfortunately fell asleep last night trying to watch it because I, if I sit on my couch and put on a television show, I fall asleep immediately. Uh, cause we have an L shape and the L is for me. So like we bought it specifically for me and then I sit there and then I'm out in five minutes, but I'm really excited to watch it for real. Maybe I'll watch it at like 8am one morning. And I have a lot of her old books, like her home books, just to sort of look in for inspiration and really like the, the first 80s, late 80s, early 90s iterations, but what did you think of the documentary and, and more specifically like her as a fashion icon in some ways. That's what I was sort of immediately looking at like how she wore her hair, how she dressed, her physicality was so specific even for that time. What did you think of the doc? I mean, I'm a huge Martha person. So I was really excited to see this. I did feel, I mean, this is not really about her style, but you definitely feel the, I think injustice of what she went through watching this documentary. And then in terms of her look, I mean, she's always been so polished. I thought it was funny in Emily Sunberg's newsletter this morning. She said she and her friends decided to make more of an effort and kind of blow up their hair during the week after watching the Martha documentary. It's funny. And she is, you know, she always looks clean and great. I saw Simplicity City did a little roundup of her clean, simple, pretty looks. But for me, Martha is like someone who had the late in life blow up. Like I think she looks better now in her 80s than she did in her 30s. I agree. I thought it was interesting looking at her then. She's so beautiful. Like that, I think is, you can't argue that, but she wasn't and maybe it was of that time people were so done up. So if you were like a more like waspy or like patrician or like you wanted to look understated, you, her hair was not done. Like it was a little puffy and it wasn't like, there was nothing slick about her. And then you could see in the nineties when she was starting to go on TV a lot more and probably was in her 40s and 50s. She started to look a lot more polished, but I had forgotten watching her when I was younger and like how much I loved her clothes and how she looked generally like her thinking about beauty ideals. It was like a very specific niche of beauty ideal, but she sort of fit into that like, you know, where a lot of makeup, you wear jeans with a cable neck sweater, like preppy New England. And then you're right. Like she gets out of jail. She starts wearing the row and she poses for sports illustrated or whatever because you did a story on that, right? I feel like you, you did a big. Yeah. I went with the oldest person on the cover of sports illustrated. But one thing I think of too, this is a story that I didn't write, but I edited. We did 20 odd questions with Martha Stewart. So it was, you know, it was her beauty routine, her green juice ingredients, all the kind of lifestyle stuff we want to know. And she had a very, this was, I guess a handful of years ago. So she was in her late seventies and she had a very detailed beauty routine. And while I was fact checking it in the course of that, Martha called me herself and was like, no, no, no, no, you got the order all wrong. And we spent like 30 minutes on the phone of her going through just like point by point. I mean, the Korean 11 step skincare routine has nothing on Martha Stewart skincare routine. It's like something like 20 steps in the morning, 20 steps in the evening. And she's so specific about everything. It's like, that's where her perfectionism really comes through now is like in the way she does Pilates, the way she takes care of her skin, the way she eats. And I think kind of less so the way she dresses. I feel like the way she dresses is just sort of like, yeah, she loves her mez. She loves Brunello. She chooses something that looks a skinny pant and a cashmere top. And that's kind of it. Yeah. But yeah, I mean, see, Martha, it's been like the fall of Ina and Martha and they're both great. I feel like everyone kind of has their, their favorite among the two of them. Yeah. I think Martha was just much more influential on me as a young person because she was on TV so much. And Ina didn't really, Ina didn't really get famous until like the 2000s. Right? That sounds right. I mean, Ina is just so much cozier, right? And Martha has a bit of an edge and even like, which I think it's like you gravitate toward one or the other. I'm hesitant to pick sides, especially, but I think it's clear. Yeah. I would love to go to both of them. I actually think I'd prefer to go to Ina's house for dinner, but I want to go have a drink with Martha. Exactly. I think she drinks probably not. Do you ever watch that body by Mark, that video series? I think it's probably TikTok, but I don't engage with TikTok, but it's on Instagram and it's like, he's in New York usually and he goes up to people. He's like, how do you stay in shape? Do you watch this? Oh yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Every person is like, I don't drink unless they're 22. Everyone else is like, some people are like, I exercise five hours a day. And they're insane. Some people are like, I do this and I do this and it's normal. But at the end, they're always like, no, I don't drink. And I'm always like, oh, before we get to the rumor of the week, I wanted to share an observation that I had. And also our mutual friend, your ex-colleague, we both think of him as a son. Jacob Gallagher mentioned this and he made like an offhanded comment about, you call it a barn coat or a field jacket or whatever. He's like outdoorsy jackets, like the barber, bedale, like the fashion version of those, they're everywhere. You like Zara has them. Loewe did one a few seasons ago, Prada's done them. It's like the fashion jacket of the moment. Being replaced by the leather jacket, I'd say, like the leather bomber as the primary fashion jacket, but when I was in New York this time, I saw them everywhere and we stayed in the West Village. So we were around a lot of rich young people, which is, I guess, who lives there. And I saw this woman on Saturday night, we were walking to dinner and she had like a slicked bun. She was very like Sophia Richie coated, slicked bun, chic outfit and she had on a barn jacket. It was probably from Zara. It didn't look like the row one or anything, but I was like, she looked good, but I was like a little turned off by it. It just feels like, is this jacket going to get so ubiquitous that it's going to make us not want to wear ours on the school run? Or is it classic enough that to like be able to stand apart from the fact that it's become so trendy? I don't like things that I see everywhere. So my personal take would be that the Prada one is too ubiquitous at the moment with the leather collar. And I feel very sorry if someone did spend the, I don't know, $8,000 that it cost, but that said, I have seen it on people. I mean, I remember seeing Juergen Teller's partner, Dove, y'all wearing it kind of with like no pants and of course. She looks good in everything. Like she's so cool. She always looks, they go to so many fashion shows, which is very interesting. They were at a lot this season, but she's one of those people that would look good in anything. But anyway, go on. Yeah. So, so she looked fabulous. I like the row one and I haven't seen it around very much. Um, I like the vintage J crew ones a lot and I know that they're doing kind of like a merchandising push with the new version. So I feel like super low, like an old J crew one or super high, like the row one is still acceptable. But yeah, everything in between kind of turns me off just because it's a bit too ubiquitous and then I think it's going to be a Tsara soon. Right? Yeah. If it's, it's definitely a Tsara already. There, there's no way there aren't like seven of them. Yeah. I, I agree. My mom, I was just thinking about this because I knew we would discuss this last night. My mom had a pale, dusty blue. I don't even know what the blue color, it's not light blue or cloud blue. It's, but it's not true. It's, it's a lighter blue, like a Robin's egg blue almost, but maybe, but softer and dustier from LL bean when I was growing up. That was so good. And now I really wish I had kept it because I definitely took it to college and it, it was good. I have the just barber one that I hilariously bought at Madewell in like 2011 when they would, they would carry some barber stuff and it was very Alexa Chung era where she was wearing a barber. And then I bought last winter, one of the Noah barbers in this almost Nantucket red color. It's really great, but I wear them. I would not wear one in New York city. Like I, when I lived in New York and I was, I would wear it on the weekends, but I wouldn't wear it as like a fashion piece. It's not neither of them. That's very much like I wear with jeans and sweatshirt and it's perfect for LA where today it was 50 degrees this morning and I went for a run and people were wearing like coats and scarves as, as a California native, you know, that this behavior, which is truly hilarious. But yeah, it's an interesting thing. Like I would never dress it up to be a thing that I wore to work or to meetings or whatever. It feels like it's not, it's not right in that context of my wardrobe. Yeah, I don't know. I do draw a line between the barn jacket and the barber. Is that just me? Like the barn jacket I see as the kind of rough canvas and then the barber is the waxed and the barber is a little bit. I don't know. I think it's the same silhouette. Like if you, if you look it up, I did some research on this when they first started to get really popular and there is like the women's are called a barn jacket and the men's are called a field coat. And so the barber I have is definitely like a men's jacket that they just sold the sizes. Like those smaller sizes that made well or whatever. But I think it's all like that silhouette of a work jacket, essentially with a corduroy collar. It definitely feels like hunting in English and riding and all that connected. And I think Loewe was the first one to do that swing version of it, right? Before Prada did one. I do still love that. I have, I really do swing birds. Yeah, I have a child's barber, which was actually, I used to work at opening ceremony with the great Olivia Kim, who always had great fashion ideas. And she always wore the largest size of the kids barber, which I did too. And the largest boys like the 16 or whatever is kind of a great cropped cute fit. I wonder if she wears that in Seattle where she lives now. I bet she does all the time. I feel like Olivia is probably on to the next thing. And I will say with barbers now, I think it looks a little cooler for it to be oversized like your husband size. Yeah. Yeah, that's I, I am the, the NOAA one I bought is like an extra large mens, but I would never wear that again. Like if we were in New York for three months and I, I would probably bring one. And I actually took it on a trip to Europe, but it was because we were on vacation in Norway and I needed like a light jacket, but it's just an interesting how people are using them now as like a real fashion piece. Through me off a little. Maybe it's just me being not living in New York. Having an edge. This show is brought to you by Boca.

It's more just like speculation of what's going to happen at our favorite punching bag Chanel or or or not punching bag but I don't know. I feel like we're burnishing it constantly just talking about how much how important this job is. I've been hearing will past week like people have been asking me what do you think is happening there. There were a lot of rumors with the London in crowd about the Olsans which is completely BS like it's never going to happen. Totally crazy like people it's not going to happen if it happens good for them but if it happens I will take the I will say I was wrong all that stuff but I just I don't think it's happening anyway you had for innovator for the innovators issue your piece was on Mark Jacobs. And he talked a bit about wanting the Chanel job and when did you when did you interview him like how long ago was it. I interviewed him I this fall and you know I think for us that was a big question going into it was someone that's been in business for 40 years who really seems to have achieved everything what what does he have left to do what would still as post going what would be really exciting to him are there you know he was at Vitawn for so long and I'll admit going into this and researching I had almost forgotten everything he had done at Vitawn just in terms of being the first to design ready to wear there all of the collaborations essentially inventing collaboration culture and every collection was really good you know like if there's any CP that shows that he could do a Chanel or return to a brand like Vitawn no via me to brand it's his work there it's incredible so yeah we were curious whether he'd even want to return to that type of big brand. But yeah he he would love to do Chanel I think anyone would love to do Chanel it's sort of the holy grail right yeah of course I had in I wrote about this in Monday's line she and a friend of mine who worked there who was who was a designer I wonder if I could just quote him directly I'm not going to deal he doesn't it's it's not that important but he worked there for a while in the mid 2000s and he said Robert Duffy who was famously Mark Jacobs business partner for many years and was sort of any executive who wanted to be in the fashion business wanted to be the Robert Duffy to to Mark Jacobs and so he was sort of it's larger than life character and he apparently used to be like Mark Chanel contract marked and like act like it already existed and that it was it was signed and done so I mentioned it in a in a joking way but yeah I think I mean this job no one essentially what I ended up saying is no one is going to be the platonic ideal I'd like to think in some ways that Eddie Salman is but the reality is he doesn't stay at places for very long and they really want someone who could do this I think they're realistically for 10 years but just like put it on a different path and maybe even 20 years and and maybe he would stay longer for Chanel but would he and also he there's there's just so many variables with him that even though you think about like he's so good at designing product and they are such a product driven brand that it would be perfect but the thing about Mark you're exactly right like I was thinking back most of the especially when I first started going to shows I remember many of the Chanel shows I went to like they were incredible the sets were so fun and crazy but I don't really remember the clothes whereas you know I started going to Paris Fashion Week in 2009 so but the mark shows like I modeled my entire wedding look after one of one of the campaigns like the dresses the and many of his his name brand shows to or some of the most memorable shows I ever went to and growing up he was so influential and I think the thing that he's really good at and will why this latest iteration of Mark Jacobs has been so successful is that he understands that he's not a product person he's not a merchandise there's some designers like a Kim Jones they're great merchants they know what products going to sell and they mark isn't like that he designs the dream and he puts people around him to who he trusts to be able to interpret that dream for commercial success and as long as he he's so funny he has a lot of like a tongue and cheek design aesthetic like as long as they get that he isn't controlling over that part of the business and so in some ways I think that would work really really well for Chanel I the only the only question I have is like at this point in his life would he want to do both businesses and I could see if he got this job like him not even doing those two main collections for for Mark Jacobs him maybe and the funny thing is like right now the that main collection selling a burgdorff and I've just talked to so many people who are really into it and want it it's the his most recent collection that's for sale right now but I do wonder like that world where these designers run their own giant brands like his brand is hundreds of millions of dollars a year and then also run a couture house it just feels like that era is over it's too much for most of them like the Jonathan Anderson has a metabolism that I could see him he's already doing to he could he can handle the two but it just feels like from a travel perspective and like a physical like Virgil was never I remember hearing he was just he was at his house like three days a month or something it just I don't think that that kind of way of being is is the way you would so what I wonder is if he took that job would like some it would they change the configuration of the of his brand or something but I I mean my heart wants him to get it for sure it would just be amazing it would be so fun and just think of all the I think a lot of us are also thinking about like what would we want to buy and if Peter Mueller got it we know we would want to buy that too but like Mark it would just be it would be the dream it would be his dream coming true would be so many of our dreams coming true I think the takeaway you know from when we chatted as they haven't called him yet when I spoke to Sophie a couple about it she was gung-ho yes she had put in a good word and she was saying I hope that your article might you know make the worthimers pay attention give him a call I mean I think you see Coco Chanel's design influence on all these designers right so in in a sense you can almost picture any of them at Chanel like and Mark's been always been so great at accessories like if you look at the stamp bag that there's like a direct line from the Chanel 255 to the stamp just with the chain and the quilting and you know I'm team Eddie as well I could see exactly the way Eddie would do the the black Tweet jacket and the little black A-line skirt so you can almost ship any of these characters totally into the now universe I think like my dark horse is so is Simone Roshad just which I love the idea of because she's a woman she also does pearls very well she does that kind of girly side of Chanel in or I could picture her doing that for Chanel yeah I think there are very few people who will get who could get this job who I'd be like oh I don't I'm not happy I think what they shouldn't do is one thing that they I think they've been considering or they were considering was looking at like hiring less famous people and doing a person to do women's I mean they don't have as many categories as their mess like Hermes has but someone to do women's shoes they'll have all those people generally but not having like a big name who's sort of the creative director of the universe and I personally think that that really works really well in brands that are leather goods like their heritage is in leather goods Louie of a ton for instance like Mark lifted them up but then now like even though they needed a famous guy for Pharrell but they don't need like a fashion and on the other side like Nicola Gascar he can just like make crazy stuff and it's like fantastic but still spells like billions of dollars a year it's but it's not about them like Louie of a ton the brand isn't about those people whereas I think like a Dior for instance they're always talking about this concept of one Dior that maybe someday it'll just be one person designing the both the men's and women's and I think it would benefit from that because the history is in close and so like I do think that Chanel's history yes they make most of their money on handbags and fragrance and all this other stuff and shoes and accessories but the runway does really mean something for them and so I hope that they pick someone who they feel is a visionary and not someone who they feel is like a good worker and they might I don't know maybe they've already made the decision we don't know I really truly don't but but yeah I hope that whoever it is is like exciting for the market I think there's such a culture in France specifically of idolizing the designer of Chanel like I mean Carl very much made that true like there's that cliche of getting into a taxi cab in Paris and the chauffeur always wants to talk about which show you're going to and they have an opinion and they know everything about the designer musical chairs so I think it has this kind of cultural significance in a way that I can't see like a worker be taking over I really think it has to be someone with kind of pop cultural resonance but yeah we'll see I did see that Glitz reported that there would be an announcement in December I don't know how real that is it's very exciting you know Glitz is is pretty good it's very hard to because it's extremely well here is the thing let me say this to the people of Glitz it's not only is it extremely expensive it's basically impossible to figure out how to pay for it because they had a report about Condé Nast and some of the brands pulling advertising and that I haven't followed up on maybe I'll do that the sweet everybody but about pulling some advertising the some of the brands pulling advertising from Condé Nast and I wanted to read it and it was just impossible they do have I think that they like figure out who you are and they base the pricing on it's like dynamic pricing which is interesting but it was so hard to pay that I didn't even try so Glitz fix that because if I can verify some of your stuff it's gonna be better for you so if there's someone from Glitz I know one of my friends has a subscription and occasionally he will get give stuff to me but I would love to pay as I believe everyone should be paying for puck and lunch you know you can go to puck.new slash fashion people to get a discount but yeah it's interesting they have good reporters there I'm sure that it's not always totally exactly right when you're dealing with this kind of stuff that you can't get confirmed by brands you mess some stuff up but um but yeah I'll try to look into it and verify their their murmurs Roy this was so fun it was so great to chat Lauren we didn't even get into Latma and I researched oh my god well we could talk really quickly what did you think I thought it was great I loved Gretelie in the row of course that was like so good instructed by AI to just make me so happy and I thought Kim Kardashian in the atoll across owned by Princess Diana was interesting I mean you know her dress was a little cleavage forward for my taste but ultimately I love that she's buying archival fashion and I love that she's wearing out I'd rather that than it be sitting you know in the basement of a fashion museum yeah that's a really good good take positive take I thought that like lively looked great she looked has looked really good at her last two appearances so instead of just being like why do you exist I'm very pro Blake recently I and I thought a lot of the women I thought Kaia Gerber looked beautiful and Gucci couple people like Latma patrons who were wearing Gucci sent me photos and they all looked beautiful and like custom pieces that Sabato had made them one thing that someone suggested to me that I wrote about is this idea of like they could see this because Gucci's been sponsoring the Black MacAle I think since it started in 2011 and there is something about this idea of like doesn't make sense for them to put all this money into this one event and I wonder I think it does like it's a big advertisement for them on the public it's basically a Gucci costume ball like it's it's everybody wears Gucci and then also you have this exposure to the art world and the film world and everybody in LA loves this event there's a lot of positive energy toward towards it sadly I was still in New York so I didn't get to go I usually just go to the cocktails but it is really fun to go and I like going to stuff like that and seeing beautiful people dressed up but I do wonder if someday they might like if I were caring I would sponsor it overall and then you have a Balenciaga table San Laurent table Gucci table many Gucci tables because they're still the biggest and both take a table and then it becomes like a celebration of caring and that feels especially given the interest in a lot of their other brands in Hollywood like San Laurent has such a deep connection to Hollywood now they have a production company and a lot of their films are getting nominated for Oscars and things and then both Tega obviously like a lot of the young designers are really into that Balenciaga so many blue chip celebrities or a list celebrity I don't know if you can be a blue chip celebrity but a list celebrities are wearing it I think that's an interesting way for them to sort of move it forward and and also then it doesn't rely so much on like who the creative director is of that time because they it just feels like and then Gucci would that would free up budget for Gucci to do more different things during the year I'm sure they would still put the most money in because they're like you just brand in the group but it's just an interesting idea that someone brought up that I think like I don't know free advice to them I don't I don't know if anybody cares what I think but I would be really into that if they did that it would also just be like a fun thing then what LVMH do so would they start sponsoring the the one that I went to a couple of weekends ago that just started the Academy Gala Academy Museum Gala which was awesome and there were so many people wearing Louis Vuitton already that looked incredible yeah that's my my takeaway wearing cares sort of checks that box now because carrying cares now has a table for each design and it's like Balenciaga goes all out like so it sort of has those contingents in the way that you're describing yes I agree I think that that is a much more low key event they obviously have big celebrities but it almost feels like that event is a lot of clients like a lot of the brands bring clients to that and whereas this feels like a big celebrity moment so I agree but I think if they were gonna do they could do two things a year in the US and it wouldn't feel like and then they do the thing and can and then then there's there are three things but who knows we'll see yeah but in terms of ROI for Gucci I think it's great it's a great platform I also liked Mona to guard in the green dress and green eyeshadow that perfectly matched the green carpet she was like the perfect Gucci ad and she's also the most beautiful woman in the world right now yeah that green color that he's using is is really really good and I think the ready to wear he's doing is selling so it's very expensive and there isn't a lot of it but it is selling I know people who have bought stuff so proof but in the numbers it's showing up too so it's interesting congrats to everybody involved it seemed like it went really well but this was so fun thank you for reminding me about LACMA we had so much but we should we should go I took up too much your time but this was great and come back soon thanks that would be so fun
