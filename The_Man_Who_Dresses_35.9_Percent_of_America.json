I don't care about Valentine's Day. I'll go out to eat tonight, whatever you do. I do love all the decor. I love making Valentine's. I love hearts. I love red and pink. I do not love purple. No offense to my mother-in-law, but I hope you're having a nice night in tonight or going to a party or hanging out with friends, but not going out to eat. It's the worst night to go out to eat ever, even if you're going to Marco Polo restaurant at Carole Gardens, which is a very funny Valentine's scene. Anyway, hope you had a great week. I'm back in Los Angeles where it finally really actually rained. Feeling great about that. This week on Line Sheet, I wrapped up New York Fashion Week. Rachel Struegatz broke some big news about Glossier's exit strategy. If you haven't read her piece, you've got to read it. I reported from inside the Oscar Daylorenta fashion show. I was the only journalist of any kind in the room, which is a unique experience. The company's CEO, Alex Bolin, recently hired their first-ever CMO, Chloe Popescu, from UTA. And Wednesday night's show was the sort of anti-marketing marketing that I think we'll see more of from them. Rachel also had the scoop on some notable exits at MAC Cosmetics, and Sarah Shapiro gave us the latest from the Embarcadero, what's happening at Gap Inc. Finally, congrats to friend of Line Sheet, Eric Mazza, who got a fancy new job at New York Magazine. I look forward to seeing what he cooks up, and I hope he comes on the podcast soon. I also hope you enjoy this conversation with Todd and enjoy this week off between the shows I know I've got. Todd Snyder, welcome to Fashion People. Hi. It's great to be here. Thanks for having me. What did you have for breakfast this morning? Breakfast. With a five-year-old at home, it's usually whatever she doesn't eat. What is her breakfast of choice? Right now, it's bagels. She changes probably on a monthly basis. So we're doing bagels now, which is good. Have you convinced her to try lox? Yeah, actually, as long as it's not advertised, I would say. She loves salmon sushi. And if we kind of tee it up that way, she's a very kind of fickle eater. But it's always interesting, I'll say that. It is fascinating because we tried very hard. Only child, too. My kid is about to be four. We really tried to. He eats with us. We don't make him a special meal. But when he was really young, it was fun. He just would eat anything. He ate spicy food. But I think being around other kids and nannies who say, don't eat spicy. So now he's always like, is it spicy? And we'll say, but you've eaten spicy before. And then the other thing is they immediately go to the carbs. The one thing he doesn't like is cheese. Really? He likes pizza. But if we put cheese on something or he asks if there's cheese in it and we say yes, he is not on board. Yeah. Yes. So how was your fashion week? You sort of, you weren't the first show, but you were one of the first shows on the calendar this season. And you are a menswear designer, but you showed on the women's calendar how, and you've been doing that for a couple of seasons. How was it this season and what have you been learning about the importance of a fashion show? Well, it was incredible. I just started showing about a year ago again. I had taken a hiatus because of the pandemic and then really just focusing on business and growing stores. And so I kind of forgot about shows. And then last year I got invited to do Pitiyomo, which is huge and epic. And I couldn't turn that down. And it really just got my motor going again. So we showed for the second time, because we showed in spring back in September. So this is our second New York Fashion Week. And it was great. I mean, there wasn't a lot of menswear designers here, but we got a ton of attention and it was just really, it's really great. For us, it really kind of just builds the halo. We've already gotten it. We don't do wholesale per se, but Saks and Burgdorfs and everybody is asking, can they see the collection? So that's kind of exciting. I got to figure out how to sell to them, but that's the whole other thing. Yeah, we can talk about your business model and how that's developing. I was very excited because I went up to Tramel Tillman, one of the stars of Severance, who was at the show and said hi to him. It was good. It was funny. I really don't ever do that. I always say I never do that, but I really don't. And it's always ends up being guys. I went up to John Maliniat and their show a couple of months ago, but it was really fun. You had such a great mix of people and it is, you were talking about Pity Walmo and it's so clear when I go to those, I've been to Pity a couple of times, but like 10 years ago on a press trip or whatever. And that's a very specific experience to menswear and the menswear side of fashion. And I love going to your shows because everyone shows up from the world of menswear and mens editors and buyers and things. It's just a much chiller experience, but also really, really close knit. And when did you start going to Pity? Was it when you worked at J Crew or was it when you started your line? And how has that sort of community around, which is for the past 20 years has been really online of menswear helped you build your business and develop your ideas? It's been incredible. I mean, I started going to Pity back in 2012. I'd always heard about it and you see photos of course and all the people are reporting. Everybody just dresses so impeccably well and you see a lot of amazing trends. You just see very interesting people that you don't typically see altogether. Everybody from Brunel Cuccinelli to himself walking there to so many influencers, to Nick Wooster, who's the ultimate kind of invented that. You just meet all these incredible people and it's just a moment, I think that's really kind of nice. It's a little bit of a celebration in a way and a kickoff. But I was selling my collection, my champion collab there back in 2012. So that was my first time I did that and it just blew my mind that there was this many men that dress well and are into fashion. So for me, it was just incredible and just the group of people that I've met from there or continue to kind of re-engage everybody from Michael Williams to Nick Wooster to Nick Sullivan, Eugene Tong. I mean, the list goes on and on. I mean, all of us are friends, which is really nice and everybody kind of roots for each other, which is amazing. It's just kind of a nice little community of people. I'm friends with Mike and Mary, Willie. You know, we're all friendly. You know, we're all kind of weird not having them in New York City because there's not this friendly competition. It's kind of like, well, I guess, you know, so I kind of miss that when you're in New York. Yeah. At this point, you know, Pity is a trade show. How much business is getting done there? Are people placing orders there or is it more of planting the seeds and developing relationships thing at this point? It's definitely planting the seeds. We do a lot of buying there because we carry third party, you know, everything from, you know, scarves to shoes to different accessories and stuff. Things we don't make, we buy from there. So we typically, it's great. It's like a one stop shop. You can go and, you know, get your socks. You can go get watches. You know, we, I met the guy from, from Unimatic there. And it's, that's, you know, you make these kind of discoveries sometimes. It's very few and far between, but it's a great place to do business. I don't think, as they say it in the business, I don't think a lot of paper is written. I don't know if that even happens anymore, but that was kind of how we used to say it. I didn't get much paper, but all the connections typically start there. People take notes and then they kind of, once things calm down, you get an order emailed or what have you, but it's definitely kind of the beginnings of, of things. It's a great way to discover new things, but it's also a great way just to touch base and see if there's, you know, brands that you may have forgotten about. The, the partnership in collaboration part of your business is so interesting to me. And kind of speaks to the niche you've carved for yourself. My husband, you mentioned Unimatic stuff, only watch, he's a real watch he's ever bought. Wow. Which is, yeah, well, yeah, it was, it, it, it's all because of you. Yeah, it's great. So let's walk back to the beginning of your career and how you ended up at Piti in 2012. Because there are not the interest, the reason I really wanted to talk to you for fashion people in particular is because so many people when I started at Puck emailed me and said, I want you to write about Todd Snyder. I want you to cover Todd Snyder because Puck's audience, my audience online, she is, there are a lot of women, but Puck's audience was more men than women at that time. I don't, I'm not, I'm not at liberty to say what the numbers are. Now I don't know, but, but there are a lot of guys who read Puck and a lot of guys of all different industries and walks of life and everything. And they all wear Todd Snyder. They all wanted me to write about Todd Snyder. And you have sort of developed this ownership on the middle class man or middle class and above what's left of him in America. But you did a lot of work to get to Piti in 2012 and start your own thing in the, in, you know, a couple of years earlier. How did you end up doing this? Yeah. Thank you first of all for all of that. It's just amazing to hear. And I've always been a huge fan of yours. And it's nice to hear the audience is very interested in me. I, I started out, I've been in the industry for almost 30 years, wanted to be a fashion designer, grew up in Iowa, knew that if I wanted to do this, I had to move to New York, wanted to work for the best, worked for Ralph Lauren. Then I, you know, in the very beginning, this was back in 92, 93. And it was a dream come true for me. I moved here right when I graduated. I did an internship for a bit with Ralph and then got a full time job at J. Crew in 1993, where I met Jenna way back in the day. And really just loved everything I did and do. It just, they gave me opportunities that I never thought I would be able to do. And they believed in me. And then from there, I went to Old Navy, I went to the Gap and worked with Mickey there, which was just incredible. So I was there for about five years. And then I went back to Ralph Lauren again. And I worked there about two years under John Barbados, which was huge for me. And then he left and then I went back to the Gap to work for Mickey and Jeff Fifle, who was there at the time. And then they left and went to J. Crew, back to J. Crew. Mickey bought part of the company. And then in 2004, 2005, they asked me to, to be the head of men's. And that was just epic for me. I knew that that was an opportunity. I knew I always wanted to do my own collection, but I had such a great job. I had, you know, I was able to fly around the world and, you know, first class, business class, stay in the best hotels, shop in Paris, shop in London. And that was really my job was, you know, as a designer, you were always studying other designers and brands. And it was just a great learning experience for me. A kid from Iowa had never been out of the state barely. And all of a sudden I'm, I find myself on international flights and it was just, I had the best time and I still do. But I was always very fortunate and worked for some amazing people. And I knew, you know, my dad always told me if you want to be the best, work for the best. And I knew Mickey was the best in business and I knew Ralph was the best in design. And I just always felt that, you know, to, to be able to become my own designer, I, I needed that experience to really launch myself. So in 2009, I left J. Crew and launched my own collection. And, you know, I guess what, 14, 15 years later, I'm still here, which is, uh, is a testament. You left J. Crew just as your influence on American men's fashions really started to take hold. It was like 2007, 2008, when the J. Crew guy became the J. Crew guy who you made. So that's a big risk. You have this great job. You've worked at these big retailers for years. You were brought with Mickey to different jobs. Like you had some sort of security with him, obviously. Did you work with Jenny Ming at, at Old Navy? Yeah, I love her. She's awesome. That, I mean, I was working for Old Navy and that's, that was, I mean, gosh, I was there when it was four stores and they quickly, you know, they were the fastest growing brand to a billion. And it was, it was amazing. I, you know, I probably didn't fully realize what I was getting from that as far as influence and seeing that, but it definitely influenced me as far as how I think about the business and how I think about people. They just were incredible mentors and just incredibly smart people. It just, I was surrounded by just talent, which for me was incredible way to learn this group.

It makes sense to leave this cushy job that was, I'm sure, very hard, but very fun. What made you take the chance? Well, I had turned 40 right around that time and I knew if I was ever going to do my own thing, I needed to do it. And to be honest with you, I didn't realize how big J Crew was going to get. I mean, when I was there, it definitely became kind of the zeitgeist of men's wear, but it really kind of came into, you know, Frank Mujins is still very close and dear friend of mine. He and I were doing men's together as me, him, Tim Hamilton, who was another amazing designer. My God. All my faves. Yeah, that was my dream team. I Frank was at your show on, on Thursday, right? Yeah, I, he doesn't like me saying this, but he's like an influencer. I'm like, dude, you're like, like people like watch him and he's got such incredible style and he's just such a good person too. Um, and Tim, so we all met at Ralph back in, in 1999, 98. And I knew when I got this job at J Crew, I wanted to hire the best people. And Frank was number one and Tim was number two. And, and then we just kept bringing on just amazing people from back in the day when Abercrombie was super strong. It was hard to get people to leave Abercrombie because they paid him so well. Yeah. Um, but just incredible talent, you know, from all over the, the globe, um, that we brought into the, the business and then it started snowballing. And then quickly the business grew very quickly, um, beyond that. And then you started your business and Tim also started a line around that time. That's when I met Tim because he was doing his line and he was deeply involved in CFGA and he picked up women's really quickly too. Uh, why did you do it? I mean, it's funny. Mickey still reminds me, um, because I had this opportunity, I had this vision of what I wanted to, to do. And I knew I better get going because it takes a long time to build a brand and build a business and I wasn't getting any younger. I was 40 at the time. Um, that was, you know, 17 years ago. And, um, it's, it's just something I always had a dream and I thought I better do this or, or just shut up about it. So I did it and, um, you know, it just kept going. And, um, you know, we first got into Bergdorf's was our first order. Got into Neiman's. Um, and then Japan actually was our biggest, um, business. We were selling a million dollars a host sell to them the first year, which was just incredible. How hard is it to make product that Japanese stores don't return? Cause aren't they like extremely particular about everything? Very. I mean, they, they turn to garment inside out. They look at every stitch, every detail they want it to be perfect. Um, but, um, we had a really good partner there. I mean, we sold host sell and, um, and then we started opening stores. We had about four or five stores in Japan for a bit and, um, um, it was incredible for me. Cause Japan has always been a huge, you know, piece of my process and inspiration and just, I have just a huge amount of love for not only the, the country, but the style, the, the culture, the food. It's just the, the people are just incredible. And, um, it's just, it's a really different way of life. And it's, it's just great. I, I am so blessed. I've probably been in Japan probably 30, 40 times in my life. You need to meet my husband. Cause you know, he, he goes twice a year. Wow. I'm going in April with him. He like makes it quote unquote work, but he, all his best friends are there. Every white man who's 40, 42 years old is his friend. There's about five of them. Um, he, he loves it. I didn't even know David Marks and I, do you know Craig Mod? Have you ever met him? No, he's just like this crew of guys. They're his best friends. So he goes and hangs out. Um, but it's, it is such a special place. And because you are sort of redefining America, the, what it is, or, or defining what American menswear is in this era and they study it so closely that like language and exchange between you and that culture is, is super clear to me for sure. Yeah. And, and you asked earlier, I know how to, how to, how to, how to, how to, how to, how to, you know, collaborations come into play and, and it really came from my trips to Japan. Um, they love a collaboration. They love a collaboration. I remember when I was selling host sell to them, uh, in early 11 or so, um, I, they were asking me to do collaborations and, and at the time I was just coming off of J. Cruz, I kind of wanted to give that a break a little bit and, um, they were really pushing me to do something. And so I, you know, for me, when I, when I'm there, I'm always discovering, um, rediscovering, I should say American brands. It gives, because they covet them like nobody's business, you know, between Red Wing to, I mean, a champion sweatshirt, a good champion sweatshirt, there'll be $500 to $1,000. And, you know, Levi's, if you find a, and they covet them, um, Levi's could be 10 grand, 20 grand based on how old it is. So your collaborations, you have this collaboration with champion Bill Cohen, who is our, uh, dry power columnist at puck is a huge fan of, of that line. And then you do this line with Woolrich, you have all these different things, watches, new balance, and you were doing that at J. Cruz too, right? You were a big part of them starting that. Uh, what, how much of that, how big is that, or how important is that to your overall business as you, because your business changed at one point where you were doing wholesale and then you pulled out of wholesale to focus on direct, but kept doing the collaborations. Like, what's the balance of your business now? Because there's very rarely, I was talking to a designer the other night, he was thinking of starting something and they were like, I just don't know how to make this profitable. Like, is it possible to make it profitable at this point? You can make it profitable for a while if you do wholesale, but then eventually the anniversary stuff starts getting in the way. And it's just hard to run one of these businesses and make money off of them. So how did you, how does, how do the collaborations and your business model, how does it all sort of balance out today? Well, um, I could probably write a book on it now. I've done probably over a hundred collaborations. Um, but, um, you know, but it's changed so much. Uh, when I started, you know, my thought was nobody really knows who Todd Snyder is. So why not partner with brands that have more brand awareness, i.e. champion, everybody pretty much knows who champion is. And, you know, of course there's the customers that are more traditional that are like, why is the sweatshirt so expensive? That's not the guy I'm trying to, you know, convert into a Todd Snyder brand. Yeah. Um, then then there's a guy who gets it and it's like, Oh my gosh, this is made in Canada. This is amazing quality fits great. It doesn't shrink. Um, you know, so for me, cha, you know, champion was kind of the beginnings of it. And it was just an incredible moment to really do something different. I also try to do things. And I don't know if you notice that it is semi intentional, meaning I do try to think about trend and think about what, what's missing, you know? Yeah. So champion was way before athleisure, you know, athleisure was something that kind of came on maybe four or five years after I started doing it. And not that I started it by any means, but I, I felt that there was a need. And I, and for me, it's always about the authenticity of it, meaning like, this is real, like I'm not just making up Todd sport, you know, um, I wanted to do something that's real and authentic. And that's why I do them is for that on authenticity. And, you know, we have, we have a saying in the brand, we call it our four or three C's, uh, which sounds kind of business talk, but, um, it's about the collection. It's about the curation, you know, the, the stuff, the third party that we buy and put in the stores. And then it's about the collaborations. And the collaborations, these are kind of like our three pillars in the brand. And we use them to really kind of help shape the brand and to give customers things that they can only get from us and make it unique to us. So we're almost in a way, you know, a mini boutique, you know, department store that has a one stop shop and has all these interesting things that you can only get from us that, that I designed for the most part, you know, um, third party, you know, sometimes we do some special makeups, but one customer came in and I just loved what he said to me. He's like, look, I know new balance is cool. Cause I don't know what you to buy. If I go to their website, they have like 200 styles. I come to you, you have four. I know I'm going to pick my favorite of the four and I'm cool. Yeah. And that's essentially what we're trying to, trying to sell. Yeah. Is we're really trying to be that, um, store that you can come to and be a one stop shop that you can get things that you feel comfortable in. And you know that you're not passe, you know, you're not, you know, going to make a wrong choice. And that's really to me, what, what all that's about. And the other thing is far as collaborations to your friend who said, I don't know how to make money. I, because I've been in this business a long time. Um, I've been very, uh, fortunate in my career path, but also I don't, I love advising people. And the one thing I would say to that person is you should be getting paid for that. You should have the brand paying you. If you can't figure out how to make money, first of all, you shouldn't do it. Uh, second of all, you should be demanding, you know, uh, compensation for that. You know, when you, when you see the targets of the world and granted, they're giant working with designers. You know, they're, they're probably getting the seven figures for, for that collaboration. So I think that would be my biggest piece of advice to anybody thinking about doing collaborate. Unfortunately, I know the numbers, Todd, and they're often not getting seven figures. Well, even six, you know, it all depends on what they are. Like what is that? You know, sometimes it's like 200 grand. They're making on that stuff. Yeah. And it all depends on how much it takes your eye off the ball. Um, and it's about like, you don't want to. You know, I started working with Woolrich recently and, um, it's been amazing. I really love doing it, but I really had to step back and say, can I do I have the bandwidth for this? And, um, you know, I also made them, I'm somewhat unique because I do have an established business. You know, I made them, um, help support me, meaning getting me a designer to do it because like I couldn't do it all. And you just have to be honest. You have to say, here's what my band with us. Here's what I can do. Throw it out there. You never know if, if they're going to take it, but you kind of need to draw that line in the sand and what is it? Cause I mean, we'll get you good brand exposure. Will it bring in some income? Will it help attract new customers? Well, all those things you have to just weigh into your business and decide whether or not it's, it's the right, the right time or what have you. I mean, the best thing about this is the fashion is a lot like high school and dating, uh, if you let everybody know, I want to date you. They don't really want to date you. And if you're kind of the one who's like not trying to shop yourself around, it's amazing how many people want to be with you. So it's better to be a little coy and in these things and they'll respect that and they'll, they may come back to you in two years, but if it's not meant to be and it doesn't make sense, then you just need to walk away. It always sounds like a great opportunity, but it's best. I probably have turned down, you know, two or three times as much as I've done. So it's, it's not always like music. Each spring, 23 Pulitzer Prizes are rewarded for distinguished journalism, books, drama and music. It was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out it was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself?

You also had this, and I don't know if this is still in business, but you had like a college sweatshirt business or something. Can you talk a little bit about how your business, how, how, how it's helped to be owned by a bigger company that doesn't do the same thing that you do. Like they're in a different business than you're in. But how did that end up happening? And what, what has that given you in terms of freedom or resources to develop your brand further? Well, I know it's a long story, but like maybe in, in a minute, you could say, you know, or five minutes. You have to do a countdown. Let me rewind and play my short version. When I left J Crew, I knew I had needed a source of income and my brother and I had started a t-shirt line called Tailgate Clothing Company. And it was all for college t-shirts. And it was something, you know, for me, it was a passion because I would go back to football games and have nothing to wear. And here I am working a lot. And I'm like, why don't we just do this? And so he started off doing it and, um, and then I helped kind of fuel it and was always a little bit involved and, you know, started my dad's basement and it just grew very quickly. And then when I left J Crew, I left J Crew, which you'll point even crazier. I left J Crew on a Friday. And I left J Crew on a Friday. And then I left J Crew on a Friday right before Lehman Brothers went under on Monday. Shit. Yeah. Mickey was like, are you sure you want to leave? And then of course I was like, I had already kind of resigned and whatever they kept me off like. I bet he was so mad at you. Oh, he was so pissed. He's still so pissed at me, but it's, it's all good. Um, he was so mad. I've never seen a matter. And I never had seen a matter. I was like, oh gosh. And, um, so he kept, you know, kept asking me periodically, I stayed on for three or four months and, um, to help them transition. And, you know, I knew I needed a job and I needed some income because my plan was just to go out, I'd saved all my money from, you know, J Crew and just everything. And I knew I needed a job. And so I started talking to my brother. It's like, maybe I can help you grow this. So they started doing that. And it grew very quickly. And we got lucky. Um, good friend of mine, Mark Breibart from Gap was at Old Navy and said, Hey, you still doing that T-shirt line? Yes, I am. And, um, he really gave me the jumpstart. We quickly became like a $20 million business. It was like a million dollars before that. And we were selling T-shirts to Old Navy. We were also growing our own brand. Um, the T-shirts were not branded at tailgate. And it was a great way to kind of build scale and have some income. And I started using that income to build the Todd Steiner brand. And then a good friend of mine, um, Mike Tucci, who is a huge mentor of mine from, um, Old Navy and Jimmy Olson, uh, from Old Navy as well, um, joined me and, and helped grow the brand. And then quickly we scaled to about 30 million. Um, and, and then American Eagle had seen, uh, you know, this was kind of a bit of a convoluted story, but American Eagle had seen, I did a pop up for my champion collaboration down in Lolita on Elizabeth Street. I remember that. Oh, you do? Wow. Yeah. I think I went to the opening and got a sweatshirt and because they did, um, they, they cut them off to make them like cropped for girls. That was me. I was there with scissors, like, uh, customizing shirts. Oh, wow. Back when we were kids, um, yeah, it was, uh, that was kind of the beginning. It really, I had been nominated through CFDA, Vogue Fashion Fund. So I was doing that. I was nominated for, you know, CFDA menswear designers and the brand really started snowballing. And at that point, Roger Markfield and Jay Shottenstein came into my store. And they're like, who's this guy? And, and Roger, I knew, and Roger, it really got his attention. And then I got a phone call, you know, maybe actually it was pretty shortly thereafter. I remember I was at a trade show in Vegas and, you know, doing wholesale. And, uh, this kid comes in as, you know, Jay Shottenstein wants to meet you. And I knew Jay was, and I'm like, yes. And, and it was actually, um, Jay's son. Um, and he said, you know, Jay wants to meet you. So I'm like, how do I get a hold of this person? So it took about a year or two, uh, for us to kind of get to know each other. I went to many dinners and showed many decks. And at that point we had already had a tailgate store open in Iowa. And then quickly they're like, you know, what this makes sense for American Eagle to help, you know, build their brand and kind of on campus, uh, presence. So they bought us. They, when I say us, they bought the brand tailgate. And then, you know, Todd Snyder, as I always say, was kind of a gift with purchase. So, um, but unfortunately the tailgate brand's not going anymore, but Todd is the TS brand, as we call it, is, is, is still going, you know, nine years after their purchase. Yeah. And, and going, going strong. It's, it's become, it really has become the sort of go to for a large group of people in this country, which one of the things I wanted to talk to you about today is I've been to your last two shows and I don't know if I'd ever been to one of your shows before, maybe years ago when you used to show on what they called men's day or, or whatever. But, um, you know, you're a very elegant person. You're an elegant designer. Your clothes are getting more and more. I mean, you've trained consumers to be interest, more interested in fashion and especially in our country where men in particular are sort of programmed from a young age, not to care or act like they don't care about clothes. Um, and so you, you're training this group of men. I think like my husband's, husband's interest in fashion came from American, I don't know, not American, I was almost at American apparel came from Jay crew in 2007, 2008. And then he started, you know, develop it. He, he fell in love with Japan and started going there a lot. And then also just different designers. And now he wears, he has a thing from a kind of guys. And that is because of you. Like he would not because of me. Um, but, but the, the thing is like that runway show, it was like a lot of really dressy clothes, a lot of silk. You obviously developed a lot and it, it felt very rich. And I don't mean that in terms of expensive. I just mean like in terms of the colors and, and the textures and all that. But you're also, you are really dressing like just dudes. Like every single guy I work with at Puck wears your stuff. Like they all, they, if you, if you buy a suit now, it's a Todd Snyder suit. You, you and I met at San Vicente bungalows probably what year and a half ago. And this guy, I'm sure an agent from CA, UTA or something came up to us and was like, I'm such a big fan and they, and they knew you. So how do you reconcile like the person that you're selling to who doesn't look at the European runways at all is not interested in that part of fashion at all. It doesn't even want to admit sometimes that they're interested in fashion with what you're, what you want to do as a designer, like how do you bring those two things together? I think a lot of it comes just from, you know, who I am, you know, growing up in the Midwest and then moving to New York. Um, I travel the globe. So I'm always inspired by travel. I'm always looking at what people wear. I study it like nobody's business. Um, I'm on Pinterest all the time. It's my source for inspiration. And I'm always just trying to take everything in and just watch what people wear. And I think I've always had a very good sense of how I would dress in certain situations and, you know, whether, you know, if you go to Palm Beach, you're certainly going to dress different than you would if you were in New York City. Or if you're in LA, it's different than you would dress in New York City. It's, it's similar, but it is definitely has its own vibe. So, and, and I kind of get that. Like I can watch what people wear. I can even just walking through airports, which isn't always the best dressed people, but you get kind of a sense of where, you know, where people are going, what they're wearing. Um, so I've always had that in me and I worked in sales way back when at an old men's store and it was just always good at me addressing myself, but then also addressing others and selling to others. Because, you know, for me, it's always been about making guys feel comfortable and making kind of tearing down the barriers of, you know, fashion definitely was like a four letter word to a lot of men and still kind of is, but I do think that's, you know, the next generation, every generation comes out. It's different. And it's just seeing that, you know, and I have three daughters now. I have a Gabby who's 24. She's in the business. She works for Reformation. She used to work at ULA. Um, and then Cici is at Michigan. She's getting ready to graduate and I follow them too. And I watch what they wear with their friends wear and it's just for me, it kind of comes easy, but it's because I study it. I, I'm always looking at things. I'm, whether it's movies or people or, you know, reading, um, there's always something very interesting about costume and what people wear. I mean, you think about like, why did you put on what you put on today? You know what I mean? It's like you wake up in the morning and it's not like you're, there's a feeling you have and it's, you know, whether you want to be, you know, ostentatious, whether you want to be reserved, whether you want to be as classic, like everybody kind of has their own, as I say, uniform that they wear, but it is, they're definitely influenced by whether it's the weather, whether it's the occasion they're going to, or just in general, they want to, you know, dress their best. And for men, I do think that they want to dress well, but they kind of don't want to be pegged as somebody who cares. And that's always been kind of a tough balance for men to, to do that. And I understand it. So for me, it's about putting forth, uh, great design, great quality and making it easy for the guy, meaning like you don't want to be, you know, shocking them too much, um, but you also don't want to be too boring. So there's always a balance in between there that I try to, try to shoot for. And I think it is because of my upbringing, um, but also just for, you know, I see our guy being, I go to a lot of our stores and what they wear, uh, what our staff wears always influences me too. Um, and I really pay attention to all those, those cues and, and try to evolve with, with the customer, uh, whether it's younger generations or, you know, different locations and we have almost 20 stores now in, in the States. So it's incredible. So I have a quick fire round for you from the men of puck. They asked a lot of questions. We're not going to go through all of them because some of these questions are, are not, not worth your time. But, um, really quickly, you mentioned your upbringing a couple of times. You're from Iowa. Can you describe it a little bit? I should have asked you that earlier, but like, did you feel, I asked Aaron Levine this too, he grew up, I believe in Virginia. Like, did you feel weird that you were into fashion? Like, how did you know you wanted to be a fashion designer, especially like this? Now that would not be crazy for a kid in Iowa, but back then you must have felt different in some way. And like, what was the environment that has kind of influenced how you approach it all? Well, back then, yeah, I felt like I didn't, I was in college originally, went to Iowa State and I was studying. I changed my major many times. I truly wanted to be in fashion. I thought I wanted to open my own store. I was working in retail. And it was just not one of those things anybody ever talked about in high school. There was no placement test that said, you should open a men's store or be a designer. And I read Ralph's book back in the day, it was the first book. I can't remember the name of it, but I was like, oh my God, I want to be that. And, oh wow, that's cool. And I didn't know how to do that. And then, and it was funny, I went to Iowa State, started off in freshman engineering. I was always good at numbers. My dad was an engineer, a civil engineer, had his own firm. And still one of the biggest firms in Iowa. He's no longer around, but he was always very good at building things. And he was great with people. He was great with, you know, super smart, but very good at managing people. And, you know, I get a little bit of that from him, I would say. And then my mother also went to Iowa State as well, go cyclones. They both, you know, came from very simple, humble beginnings. They both, you know, grew up on farms and they were the first of their family to go to college. And I was always very fortunate in that, but they also had very simple ways of dressing. And like I had like a pair of jeans, a couple shirts. I don't even remember, but it scarred me. I remember in sixth grade, and I don't think I've ever told this story, but I remember in sixth grade, like we were getting ready for a musical for school. It was like a holiday musical. And everybody was talking about what they're going to wear. And I remember like, oh gosh, I have nothing. I have a pair of jeans that have holes in them. And everybody's talking about they're going to wear this corduroy thing or what have you. And I was so embarrassed and I didn't go to the event. I didn't participate. And I just, I had nothing to wear. And it always made me feel like, oh gosh, I don't want to feel like that way again. And then when I started getting in high, or middle school and high school and I could work, you know, I could make some money. I would just make a little bit of money and I'd go by clothes. And that just became, you know, something of me. Like I didn't want to ever feel like that person that didn't, that had literally one pair of jeans and a couple shirts. And, and then I started getting attention and it was just like, oh, this is kind of cool. You know, you dress better and people kind of treat you differently. And I still remember that. And it's the one thing that probably got me into it. But I kind of got good at it. And then I started working in stores and I was like, this is really fun. And, you know, freshman engineering turned into architecture, turned into business finance. And then I, a friend of mine, Steve King, who actually he and I still work together at Todd Snyder, was working at Yonkers, which was the Midwest department store. He was working in your names and I was working in Des Moines. And I said, aren't you at Iowa State? Aren't you at some textile program or something like that? And he's like, yeah. And, and so I met the professors and the counselors and, and I remember them saying to me, and this is the case in 92. They're like, are you sure you want to be a fashion designer? You know, you're going to have to sew. And I'm like, yes, I'm sure. And, and, and that's how I got into it. I finally just said to heck with things. And it was more so just the phobias of being a fashion designer. And then what, what all, it all made sense. You know, I, I, you know, worked as a tailor at a place called Badours, taught myself how to sew, loved it. I would, I would hem, you know, pants and just do whatever I could to learn. And, you know, people are kind of like, what are you, what are you, just everybody? I play basketball, you know, people are like, what do you do? I'm a fashion designer. And I stopped seeing fashion designer. I would say design, I'm in design. And, but there's definitely, you know, you know, stigmas and, and homophobes. And, and that was very prevalent back then. And even with my family, I, and the best part of it was, I remember I was visiting my grandma, you know, all my cousins were there and stuff. And they were all like, I was going to move to New York City. And I had made the decision and they were all thought I was nuts. And I just remember my cousins, you know, we always, everybody razzes each other. And I said, I'm going to be a fashion designer. They're like, what, you know, I can't believe you're going to do that. And then my grandma says, what are you going to do? And she said, I said, I want to be a fashion designer, grandma. And she's like, that makes total sense. Snyder and Dutch means Taylor. And I was like, wow. She told me 10 years earlier, I would have been like, okay. Wow. Screw all of you. Yeah. So you did it. I don't want to encourage too many people to start their own lines, though, maybe just go work for time. So, so you did it. Here are, I'm just going to ask you a few questions from the guys at work who all love your stuff, mostly Peter Hamby, the host of the powers, the B podcast. He's a big Todd Snyder fan. He asked a bunch of questions. I'm going to do the good ones. One is, who are your style icons? Paul Newman. Great. Two is, when are extra wide pants finally going away? I don't think they actually exist, but it's fine. What is your take on that? Um, I think it'll be a while, but I would say the extra wide. I mean, the big, super extreme ones. You know, I always kind of see them already on kind of the downside. I mean, but you're going to see bigger proportions. I think it's art and I think it's the type of thing that you see it. How does it come back to something that's more wearable? But if you look back to the 80s and you look at the suits, what guys were wearing back then that it's incredible how you can pretty much fit someone's waist and the leg. So it takes some time. You'll get used to it. And then you'll think, gosh, how did I ever wear skinny jeans? Yeah, it's going to be okay, Peter, we promise. Okay, this one is a good one. Men's wear guy, hero or villain. Do you know about this guy? The, the hash, the men's wear guy on Twitter. Oh my God. You don't know about him. Lucky for you. I live under a rock. Okay. That's interesting. He's very divisive. I like him, but. Well, style.com, I did not know who he was until about a year ago. Oh, style.com. Yeah. Yeah. He was at your show. He's been at both. Yeah, he's been at both and thank God for my team because they're brilliant. And, um, he's, he's said some pretty clever things. I love him. Todd Snyder is not sexy. It's sex. And I just was like, oh yeah, I just said, I had to sit next to him at the show where you made everyone look everyone directly in the eye and I was extremely uncomfortable. I heard about that. I apologize. It was definitely my direction. I told the, the models, I said, don't be afraid to look people in the eye. But it was a small show. A lot of people really liked it. So it was successful. It was a small show. I wanted it to feel intimate and obviously maybe a little too but anyway, so the other two questions, this one is from another Peter at the office who says, when are you supposed to wear? He got the Todd Snyder house pants for Christmas. What time of the day are you supposed to wear house pants? I think this is a silly question, but you can answer it. Um, whenever you want to, I would say, I mean, the, the, I mean, how they are not necessarily just for the house. I mean, it's, it's something that you can wear, um, lounging around. You can wear them out to the pool. You know, if, if you're confident enough, you can, you know, wear them, you know, around, around town, it's meant to be something that you can style differently. You know, you can wear it with a third piece, as we call it, like a, a jacket or even, um, a sweatshirt or something. So whenever, whenever you want, I mean, that's that, I would always tell people, like, you know, whenever you got damn well, please, but anyway, that's, uh, I would spray them it up. I agree. So final question from David Kobe, the best dressed guy at puck by far. Mickey Drexler met him and it was love at first sight. He was like, you're, you look so cool. Um, I, you get a discount. Um, so David asks, what do you wear to the airport? Are you a sweats guy or a fly? Nice guy? I thought this was a great question. It's a great question. I fly nice. I, I, um, if I'm, if I'm doing an overnight though, I will bring, um, a, a change of, so I purposely, you know, a, you know, big benefit of doing champion is I have enough, you know, joggers and stuff that I can wear, but I typically wear those after I get on the flight. If I'm doing overnight, but I do not subscribe to the, you know, wear it to, I mean, you never know who you're going to see. I agree. Todd, thank you so much. This was so fun. Congrats on everything. And I'm sure we'll chat soon. Thank you. This was incredible. Um, I, it's a huge honor to talk to you all day. Yeah, I'm sure we will chat again soon.
