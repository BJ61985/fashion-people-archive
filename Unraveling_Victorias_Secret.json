Hey everyone, happy Friday. I'm tired. The older I get, the tireder I get, but also the older I get. The more I think that introvert, extrovert means nothing. It's complete BS because there are parts of me that are extremely extroverted, but then there is a lot of me that is extremely introverted. And I will tell you our book launched on Tuesday, which you probably know because that's all I'm talking about right now because you have to promote it a lot so people buy it, et cetera. And it's just been a lot of interviews, which I'm not used to obviously. I'm usually on the other side, but then also just having to interact with a lot of people in a positive way. But it's just exhausting for someone who doesn't really enjoy making eye contact with people. But I'm not complaining. I'm very grateful that people care. If people didn't care about the book, then I would be very annoyed. So thank you all for caring. And thank you to anyone who's bought the book, selling sexy Victoria's Secret and the unraveling of an American icon. And thank you also to everyone who I got to see this week. A massive, massive thanks to the team at Puck, who threw Sean's Hallow Me a party on Wednesday night at Borgo in the city. It's a new restaurant in Manhattan from the Tarlo people. It was a perfect night. Can't wait to go back to the restaurant and eat more food. And also I can't wait to go back to having one job. I guess I technically have two jobs because I also have a child, but like one job job. Speaking of my actual job this week online, she, you know, we kept it moving guys. We had a lot of stuff. As I said in Wednesday's email, it was succession week. And, you know, we don't make the rules. This is what happened. It was just all about succession. I had LVMH succession on Monday. Rachel Strugeatz had a massive estate lauder scoop. She has the inside track on the next CEO and you got to read it. I'm so proud of her. It's, she's like really owning the story. She's the only person you need to read about estate lauder. And it's really fascinating company and, and you should subscribe and check it out. If you're not already a subscriber, please do that. And then on Thursday, I had an exclusive excerpt from the book about Epstein. I gave you guys that Epstein one to conclude the book content. I have decided to have Sean Talon, the pod to talk a little bit about her career, how we ended up writing a book together and all that good stuff. I hope you enjoy it and we'll talk next week. And again, thanks to everyone who's been real nice to me in the past couple of days, but also the last 20 years. I love you all. Sean Tal, Fernandez, welcome to fashion people. Oh my gosh, Lauren, thank you so much for having me. I'm so excited to be here on this momentous occasion. I can't believe this is the first time, not last. So let's start out. What'd you have for breakfast? What's going on today? I had buttered toast, which is what I've been having for many years. I know it's not the most fashionable breakfast, but it works for me. I think it's fairly fashionable. The question I have for you, where's the protein in this meal, Sean Tal? There's protein in the bread. The butter? If you choose the right bread. And the butter, yes, I guess. Interesting. What bread are you eating that has a lot of protein? Like a more seeded whole grain type bread. Okay. Yeah, the bread choice is really important. I could talk about this for a long time. Have you ever had adventure bread? No, what is that? So you should, because you go to San Francisco a good amount, right? You have good friends who live there. Yeah. So there's this bread that this baker, Josie Baker makes called adventure bread. And it's actually gluten free. So people with celiac can eat it. If you're not afraid of cross-contamination and they sell it at LaMille, which is like a toast restaurant. And then they also sell it at Buy Right grocery store, which is probably the best grocery store in America, maybe number two to cookbook. And cookbook in Los Angeles makes a version of this bread. And it's basically just seeds. Oh, that sounds nice. But it's very salty and yummy. It's really good. I highly recommend it. Actually, when you come for our book tour stuff in LA, go with Julia to the cookbook in Larchmont and get the adventure bread. That sounds great. But I like gluten in my bread. It's not about that. You don't have to be contrarian in this case. It's not worth it. Like it's not about gluten. It's naturally gluten-free. They're not trying to not do gluten. It's just like it is. It is what it is. But it's really yummy. And I feel like for someone who only eats buttered toast for breakfast is a game changer. OK. I mean, I do like my bread, but that sounds great. It's just nice to change it up sometimes. You're right. You're right. Yeah, can't get too used to anything. So Chantal, you are here today. We are recording this a week before it will be published. So we're recording Friday, October 4th, and we will run this Friday, October 11th. And after that, we will have experienced, we will have survived our week of our book, Selling Sexy, Victoria's Secret, and the Unraveling of an American Icon. Being published. It came out October 8th. It's so crazy. Can you believe it happened? No, I don't. I can't. It's going to be very surreal to see this book in stores after all this time, but very exciting. I mean, yeah, it's crazy. We've been talking about it for so long. I thought this day would never arrive. I truly didn't. I remember I would think, okay, by this time it'll be done. By this time, I'll have had to do this. By this time, and the thing that we have learned in this process is it's never truly over, and it will not be over this week because then six months from now, when it goes into paperback or whatever, we will have to promote it again. And it's just like constantly promoting these books, even after, if we each write other books, like we'll still have to talk about this book. This book will never leave us. We'll be thinking about Victoria's Secret for a long time. We've already been thinking about it. Yeah. So let's get into, I thought it would be fun. We have done a lot of press already, and we're going to be doing way more press next week. I thought it would be fun for us to talk about our process in conceiving the book and writing it, and what the experience has been like. Because I think a lot, we've already gotten some questions about writing a book together, which makes sense. It's very common these days, but it is something people are curious about. But I thought it would be interesting since the fashion people listener is a mix of industry insiders and then people who are interested about what goes on inside the industry, how we did it. And so, first off, I wanted to talk a little bit about you and how you became a fashion journalist, and then we can discuss how we met and how this all happened. But what's your elevator pitch trajectory to becoming a fashion writer? It was sort of happenstance to a certain degree, but I sort of got launched into this world because I very randomly got a job at Vanity Fair as an assistant, first as the assistant to the art director, Chris Dixon, and then to Graydon Carter. So that was my introduction, fast and furious introduction to the media world in New York. And there was a bit of fashion there, but there wasn't the focus, obviously. And then from there, I went to Lucky Magazine and then Fashionista, where it was really the first time that I was reporting and writing about fashion and where I met you. And that's where I thought, oh, this is such an interesting space to focus on. And it was a fun time to be writing on the internet, generally. But I thought fashion had such interesting characters, a really interesting business model, so many events happening, intersecting with all these different parts of culture. And also an opportunity to do reporting in a space where sometimes there isn't that much reporting happening, like hard reporting. And it was really stressful at times, because fashion companies don't want anyone to write about them, as you know. I know. So then I remember reaching out to you and I worked there because you were freelance and contributing, I don't know, monthly or whatever to Fashionista. And we got a coffee and talked about reporting and writing. And then it just so happened that I was looking for a different opportunity in the business of fashion. You were already there as the first U.S. person and I joined you when there was no U.S. entity and the office was essentially your apartment. And it sort of took off from there. You started on Election Day 2016. Yeah, sort of. You remember that? Yes. You came to my house and I feel like Dan, my husband, made us breakfast. Yes, definitely. Like avocado toast on gluten-free bread. Of course, because we are, I mean, I eat, I'm eating gluten right now as we do this. Wow, criminal. It's 10.47. I'm only eating my first breakfast now, my first meal of the day now. But, yeah, I mean, celiac disease is real, Chantal. No, I'm not. It just connects to what we were talking about. I don't mock it at all. Really quickly, rewinding a bit to Vanity Fair. How did you move from being Chris Dixon's assistant to being Graydon's? Because the Graydon assistant role, obviously, we know a lot of Graydon assistants. People who came after you, John Kelly, who was my boss, was Graydon's assistant. I know all the Graydon assistants. But it seems like it was a real hard job. And also, how did it that happen? That's interesting because it felt like it was very particular people who ended up getting it. But how did you make the change? Did you just supply or was Chris like, I think you'd actually be good with Graydon. He needed it. You were the second assistant, right? Yeah. What happened was that at that time, I can't remember what the circumstances were, but both assistants left at the same time. So both people were going to be new. And I think Graydon had hired the first assistant who came from outside of media, this guy, Chris Bannon, who came from Macy's. And then, so I just sort of pitched myself as, oh, I know who everyone is here and I can be helpful as sort of the person who already understands how this magazine works to a certain degree. Because both people have to be new. So you might as well bring the second person in from elsewhere. That was my pitch and I got it. Why did you want that job? Because I mean, I'm being serious. I know you. I guess you'd like to be helpful. So that's part of it. But that just seems like a very strict. I obviously could not have done that job. So I'm just curious. Yeah. I don't think I knew at that point that I wouldn't be great at it. But at that time, I just thought it would be interesting and the magazine centered so much around Graydon and Graydon's office. So I figured it would be interesting at the very least. It is always really important to be at the center of things. Make friends with the assistant, make friends with the copy editor. Those are the people who know everything, especially obviously Graydon's assistant knows everything. But it is good, I think, early in your career to have those kinds of experiences where you're dealing with the top level people. My first job was kind of like that, that like I was in the meetings with the CEO and editor, chief and all that stuff. Even though I wasn't an assistant, but I had a kind of a weird, which I think would now be like a social media job my first year in New York. And social media didn't really exist in 2005 and six. But yeah, I get it. The other question I have for you is, you have great personal style, but you're not like a fashion obsessive freak. You're not someone who I imagined was like, I can't wait till I'm old and I get to cover the collections. When I was 14, my dream was to be a fashion writer who went to Paris and wrote about fashion shows. And I'm 42 and that's what I do. But when you decided, like all the reasons you said that you decided to start covering the business makes sense. But what is your personal relationship to fashion and as a consumer and like, do you like it? How do you feel about it? I do like, I think working in fashion has now sort of created this divide between how I think about it professionally and how I think about it personally. I did always enjoy it like getting dressed and you know, expressing myself that way. But I didn't dream of covering the collections. I thought it was interesting. I just didn't necessarily, I don't know, I figured my job would be something that I couldn't quite imagine when I was 14. And not that I'm doing anything that like, you know, a job that didn't exist then, but just figured it would come when it would come. And yeah, I think, I think writing about fashion, I felt especially a fashionista where so many editors were sort of pivoting into influencing that I really didn't want to go down that path. So maybe I sort of tampered down my sense of style. You know, we talked about this a lot, like what do you wear to interview a CEO and I look younger than I am. And you know, it's so those were things that I was always in the back of my mind that I wanted people to take me seriously as, you know, to have a conversation with me. And I think I thought a lot about the way I dressed and presented in those spaces and not wanting to appear like an influencer, which is probably something that only mattered in my own head and no one was worried about it. But I think it was a complex I gave myself unnecessarily. And now I'm like relaxing a bit more about it. Yeah. But I think I just, yeah, I overthought it for sure. Well, you also came up in a time when exactly what you're saying, like pretty much all of your peers became influencers. Or like had some element of that. Yeah. Yeah, my peers went and worked at like brands and became editors at brands. Like there wasn't as much of the actual editor as influencer thing happening with the people I knew who fled the business, which pretty much everyone did. My memory of how I like was freelancing when you were working at Fashionista and I had a contract with them where I worked technically was like working half time for them. So they were my health insurance because I had done a lot for them. Yeah. You know what? Like I did a lot for that company when I worked there full time. They could give me health insurance, but, and they had right a first refusal on all my stories, but like it was never an issue. And I remember the editor at the time, Lauren Invick, who's now the fashion editor at the FT, she was out for a week and I was like playing babysitter and just checking in on you all. And you had a situation. I don't know if you remember what it was, but you had a situation with a PR person or like a company and they were giving you shit. And I just remember you came to me about it and we managed it. Do you remember this? No. I don't, I have no idea what it was about. It was, but you, and you did, you were worried about it, but like in a, not in a crazy person way, like in a normal concerned way. We managed it and you just handled it really, really well. And I remember us talking about media and me saying like you were, you were, you were an assistant at Bandy and Fair. You worked at Lucky as well when Eva Chen took over. You were Lee Bell's Ray's assistant. And like I said, you know all these people and the thing about covering media, which you ended up doing for BOF too, is that like journalists love to talk. People are always like, how does, apparently one of the Kandina stories I did recently, they were trying to like figure out who told me. And one of the editors said, and this person actually didn't, hasn't relayed this to me, someone else related to me, but they were like, I don't think it's that she's talking to one person. She's talking to many people. And so it's, it's an interesting part of the business that like writing about the fashion industry also means writing about the publishing industry in some ways. And I remember you got a job offer from another outlet and you came to me and asked if you should take it. And I was like, well, if I can I agree with you, would you rather do that? And you did it, even though we didn't even like, as you said, we weren't even incorporated at that point, I had to convince you that it was better for you to be like a contract employee rather than having a W2 and all that crap. It was such an ordeal. Do you remember all that stuff? It was so annoying. It was an ordeal. But the other job was just focused on media and I really didn't want to do that. So it was more fun to like be at a fashion publication where I could write about media but other stuff too. So that was appealing to me. Yeah, it was really good. So we worked together. Did we work together for seven years? I think six years. Because you were there an extra year on either end. So I think I was there six years. So we worked together there and you covered a mix of, I would say like you did half media, half, you did luxury, but mostly US and streetwear. I mean, at that point, it was just really me and you and like two writers in the UK. So it was, we were kind of doing everything, which is, I think you and I both like prefer that to be able to write about a little bit about everything. But at some point, Victoria's Secret was sort of, so most, I would say most of these, WWD is much more holistic because they've been around forever and they used to have a much bigger staff where they would write about like they had an editor for shoes or whatever. Like they would have, I mean, they actually have an entire publication dedicated to footwear. Sure do. They sure do. But the point being that they're like really, really cover every single tiny little thing. And I think they still try to do that. It's really challenging. But BOF was like more about what are people interested in and also based in London. So it was like very luxury focus. So you and I were covering the luxury brands, but also there's this like giant US market and Victoria's Secret was something that like would dip in and out. We would cover it around the show, but it wasn't like one of these things where we were on the beat about it. But I had covered it intermittently since 2008, 2009, when I was a reporter at Forbes. I remember I think I talked to whoever the CEO, maybe it was Sharon, the CEO. Like after Sharon became CEO, I remember doing a call with her. Sharon just returning. Yeah. It was like one of these brands that we would touch, but we didn't totally focus on. And then I remember getting a message from a person in the industry who I really respect too is very opinionated saying to me, why isn't everybody okay with this fashion show? It was probably 2015. Like why are people okay with the fact that this fashion show happens and it happens the way it happens. And I always thought that fashion show was like very hokey and a little cheesy and obviously misogynistic, but like in the way that a lot of things are and society just accepts them. But it really started to get me thinking like, yeah, this feels extremely out of touch. And then the company was still doing well at that point, but then 2016, they sort of peaked. And I think we started to really get info and people coming in with about models and things like that 2017, right? Like when did you start to feel like? I think it was a little later. Little later. But yeah, it was that trajectory, but I think it was a little later. What was tricky about the Victoria's Secret? Yes, like questions about the show and how does it still continue? Like the fact that the company was still so successful and they were still getting such great models kind of made that conversation a moot point because it's like, well, it's still doing well. It's one of the most successful American retail companies by any metric that you slice it. So it's like, all right, well, it's working. It's working for a certain segment of people. And I think it wasn't clear that it wasn't working really until 2017, 2018. And I think that opened the door to have a conversation about the marketing. And then that coincided with Me Too movement, all these like diversity marketing trends that were happening in fashion and this idea of authenticity, quote unquote, Instagram using user-generated content, influencers, like all of these shifts were fully happening and Victoria's Secret really wasn't there. So it was hard to have that conversation in a real way until the business showed any signs of difficulty because like, if it's doing well, it's doing well, you know? Totally. It's always in our line of reporting, it's always about following the money. And the thing is, I remember talking to sources very early on and being like, people who didn't work there anymore, but were like, I own a lot of shares of this company. I'm not interested in like telling you all the bad stuff that's happening or everything they're doing wrong because I want it to be okay. Yeah, I think that was a huge part of the reporting process of this book. Once that stock price started to suffer and then obviously they were separated, but like, before that, I think a lot of the people who had been heavily involved in that business, they had no incentive to talk about it, you know, even on the background. Yeah, yeah. And so those first few articles, I feel like we really unlock something when we found out about strategic patterning, which ended up not having a big role in the book, but was a sort of, can you explain what strategic patterning is to our listener and the role it played at limited brands or L brands or whatever you want to call it, the parent company of Victoria Secret and why we were writing about it in that time? Yeah, I think there was a period at L brands, the Les Wexner's massive retail company that owned at one point the Limited Express, Bath & Body Works, Victoria Secret, Henry Bendal, Lane Bryant, you know, it's expanded and contracted over the decades, but there was a period like in the 90s where he had more consultants working for him from outside agencies. And then at some point, he sort of consolidated that operation into a group called strategic patterning that reported to him and did sort of consulting type work like market research, looking for opportunities, white space, understanding trends. And it was sort of outside of any of the brands and it worked directly for him. And understanding this group was helpful to understanding through the information that was coming in that was being used to make decisions. And it's like a fascinating way to set up a company. Yeah, so a lot of these big apparel brands, they have trend forecasters or whatever, but this group was like basically in the office of Les Wexner, it was the office of the CEO, it was a very small group of people. Not all of them were MBAs, but they would always have like an MBA around to do the decks really, to like create the decks. But these people were traveling all over the world. They also had an entire network of trend forecasters that they funded for years. I wonder if any of those people are still left. I think a couple of them still work there, but like thousands of people on contract feeding them information. And Les Wexner was really interesting because it wasn't about gut for him. It was about gut, but it wasn't about his own taste. He wasn't like, oh, I like this sweater, let's copy it. He was like, oh, everybody's obsessed with this style sweater in Europe, let's copy it. Whereas Mickey Drexler, who is probably his biggest competitor and this other person who really created the American Mall with him, is very much like, I think that that skirt is awesome, let's make it. Because I know, I have good taste and I know what people like. Whereas Les Wexner was more like, everybody else thinks this is good. He was more like, I see what people like about this skirt, what element of it that we can then take. Maybe it's the color, maybe it's the way that it's displayed in the store. So yeah, that was something, that was an idea that we really wanted to try to explain in the book. Because I mean, if we zoom out, they're sort of the age of the American merchant is a lot of what we're talking about. And Wexner doesn't fit neatly into those categories or even the way that Mickey Drexler does. But the way that he was processing information, I think, was really fascinating and also really influential, this idea of serving the market and understanding and picking out the right information, which is what we call like patterning. Super fascinating to think about how that applies to consumer goods. Totally. It's so fascinating. And so was definitely what drew me to writing about this business more. And at the same time, I think the first strategic patterning story we did was at the time that Ed Rezek had been fired. It was right. It all like the confluence was all happened in 2018. And the confluence of all those things, it really is, there was just so, there were so many things that were happening in culture that line of like the trajectory of American culture, the trajectory of Victoria's secret and the trajectory of Jeffrey Epstein follow a very similar line. And so it was a fun business to cover at that time, because it just said so much about like who we were as human beings, essentially. Yeah. And sort of these cultural shifts that we were grappling with. And in some ways, like Victoria's secret got targeted, you know, I think a lot, not to over generalize, but I think a lot of women were thinking about the advertising, the brands that they supported and what they said about themselves, feminism and Victoria's secret is ripe to be, you know, examined under that lens, because it had such a specific point of view that was really about the male gaze, which they didn't invent, nor were they the only ones selling it, but they certainly perfected a method of selling.

It was during the pandemic because I remember being in or right before the pandemic being in the house that I lived in for six months during that period. And they did a big expo say there were like six reporters on it and I had so much of that info and I hadn't acted on it for, you know, sometimes like in journalism, you hold on to stuff because you're like, I need to check it out and make sure it's okay or you don't have a lot of time at that, at that time period, I did different job at BOF where I was like managing the team in some ways. And so it was a very short period of time because I like two months into doing that job, I went to our boss there and I was like, dude, I don't, it's not for me. But I was managing and, and you know, these stories are really hard. Like there's a lot of information you have to get, check it with three sources, you have to make sure it's all correct. And I was holding on to it and New York Times published this story and I was like, damn, I was so mad because I had it. And I was just like, you know, if that happens all the time, and that's you just move on, there's always another story. But I think that that also like sort of pushed me to the point when it was definitely, I think, August 20, it was either July or August 20, where you had talked to one of our mutual sources about Victoria's Secret and you called me after and basically said, this is a book. You should do a book on it. And I was like, well, why don't we do it together? Yeah, I felt at that time that the narrative around the company being like it's marketing being out of touch and these sort of bad Apple leaders as the way they were being depicted in the press was sort of the explanation of the whole story of Victoria's Secret and its struggle. And the real story was so much more interesting and more nuanced. Like those things were true, obviously, to a certain extent, but the real story was so fascinating. And even just thinking like, how did this company get so big to begin with where at its peak, really had no real competitors? And it survived all of these different cultural changes through different decades. It was amazing that it hadn't had that kind of a downturn earlier. And that was what was interesting to me is like, this is a great American fashion business story that I think has sort of been flattened out into angels bad sales down. And there's so much more here that hasn't been talked about that could be really fascinating to dive into. And this is a brand that almost everyone in the United States has some sort of memory or connection to you walked by it or you saw an ad or you saw commercial. Like, you know, I haven't met anyone who doesn't know the Victoria's Secret, the brand in these last couple of years that we've been working on it. And I've mentioned to people I'm working on this book every single time someone's like, oh, I remember X, I remember Y, I bought a bra there, I was walked by that store or I never shopped there, but it was always, you know, I knew everything about it. So, you know, it's such a, it's a unique brand in that sense. And that was part of it was like, how did that even happen to begin with is so interesting. Yeah. And we both had big ambitions to write books. And during our time of business and fashion in particular, and talked a lot about, I mean, the book that you were interested in writing, I still think you should write. And I'm not going to reveal that right now. But I think you should do it. Well, I think you should. And just because the interesting thing about books is there can be a lot of books about the same topic, we were really lucky that no one had thought of Victoria's Secret were the first book, I'm sure there will be many after us. But you can have more than one book about a subject, but like there are very few subjects that warrant books. And so I had some ideas for books. But my whole thing with a book was like, if I'm going to do this, I want it to be a commercial prospect. I didn't want to do something. Like a lot of people write really obscure books. I don't have the time. I don't have the money. Like it's just not, if I'm going to do a book, I need to at least make a little money off of it and have the potential that it could be commercially viable. And then a lot of people would read it because that's the other thing we were writing for a trade that was heavily pay walled. And we had, I mean, business fashion is hugely influential in the fashion industry, but the audience is limited. And so there, you know, I last night I was at a Rosh Hashanah dinner and a person who works in the film industry like knows about Puck knew about me. But like when I said, oh, I came from this publication business fashion, it's never heard of it. So it's, it was very insular and it felt like Victoria's Secret was something that like you said, my friends who started shopping there when they were 15 in high school would be interested in maybe they wouldn't read the whole book, but they would at least listen to a podcast about it or buy it for a friend or whatever. And then there's like the story of entrepreneur entrepreneurship and there's, which is like such an American story. And then I mean, the thing that I think we both are really interested in is the American Mall. And one of the book ideas I had had was to do like the story of the American Mall, but told chapter by chapter by the entrepreneurs who created it. So like there would be a Talbin chapter, there would be a Mickey Drexler chapter, be a Les Wexler chapter, there'd probably be an Andrew Rosen chapter, probably one of the department store people, but definitely Richard Baker at this point. But I, and that would have been fun and probably a little easier just to do one chapter on each of those people. But this just felt like the right thing. And then when we were introduced to Eric, our agent, Eric Lepfer, who's now at UTA, but who is at Fletcher, it felt like he got it immediately. And we started working on the proposal, I think in, in September or October, right? Yeah. And then by the next spring, basically, we had sold it. Yeah. And the interesting thing, and I don't know enough about the publishing industry, but I feel like at the beginning of the pandemic, there were actually a lot of book deals. Why that was financially, I couldn't tell you, but it did feel like we didn't, it's not like people were knocking down our doors, but it was a pretty smooth, seamless, I was never worried we weren't going to sell it, which is interesting. I think it's much harder to sell non, to sell fiction. I think nonfiction, if you have a good idea. And also, I think the proposal, which we really took our time with, it didn't have any original reporting. It was just like, this is our idea chapter by chapter, but I think Eric is a really good editor. So that helped. And then also, we just took our time with it. We didn't rush it. We weren't in a rush. I was very newly pregnant and was like, this is probably not a smart thing to do as zero days pregnant, but also, who knows what the future holds? And I'm not going to wait. And it ended up that I think we signed our contract the week before I had my kid. Yes, I think so. Because I definitely broke the news to my boss at Business of Fashion the week after my child was born. I think he thought I was going to call and be like, I'm not going to come back to work. Whereas I was like, yo, I'm writing a book. So not only am I going to be gone for seven months, but after that, I'm going to have to take time off because we're doing this. I just remember it was very annoying having to schedule. It seems like a lifetime ago. Yeah. And remember, we had different bosses. So like, I had to call my boss and you had to call your boss and we had to schedule it. So one didn't know before the other and all that stuff. I've deleted all memories of this. I can't believe I remember I just had a child. Yeah, that's great. I was so, so anyway. You know, one thing about that that I want to add that was interesting, if you remember, is that we got some feedback from some publishers who said that they didn't think that women would want to read a business story, which I thought was hilarious. Especially given how much interest there is in like beauty brands and the founders behind these companies. I felt like that was such a misunderstanding of how women think about the things that they buy. I mean, it's also just so like, it's just so, it turned out, Sarah Crichton, the editor in chief at the time, who had been the business, edited the business pages at Newsweek, but also had been the editor of Seventeen and is very good friends with Kim France, the ex editor of Lucky, where we both worked, not when Kim was the editor. But anyway, she was the perfect editor for us because she's a business journalist and editor, but also understands that fashion matters. Also has great style personally. But then at the time, the publisher at Holt, who's no longer there, was also a woman. So I do think it was interesting just all these misconceptions about female consumers that feel so dated. It reminded me of like, when I worked at Lucky, the cover testing thing, where they would be like, oh, you can't have, they basically would be like, you can't have a person of color on the cover of a magazine. It doesn't work. Like just awful things that feel so- Yeah. And there were other weird rules about like colors. Yeah. Yeah. There was the magazine cover testing, I feel like was a place where really antiquated stuff stayed a long time. Yeah. I remember. It was so stupid, but it felt like that kind of line of thinking where you're like, are you guys idiots? Like it's clear that this is a big cultural phenomenon. Anyway, we got really lucky with Sarah. And I was on maternity leave for seven months. And I personally thought that I was going to do a bunch of work during that time, which obviously I didn't because I don't know if you know this shantel, but like having a kid is a full-time job. You know, I've heard a lot about this. It's crazy. I was like, wow. And then I really did think about quitting because I was like, this is fun being a mom. I love going to these music classes. My kid is really smart and every time something changes. And then I went back to work and realized that that was not the life for me. But then we really started getting into the research and reporting of it. And what would you say? Do you remember how organized we were in the beginning and then it like by the end? I mean, at least we have all of our information. But when you first started reaching out for people and just so people know, like the way we did it was we essentially split the book in half. Like the cutoff was the fashion show, which started in the mid 90s. And my sourcing is much more retail people. I'm a bit older than Shantel. So like, I just know a lot more executives or I did know a lot more executives. So I felt like me doing the early days, I based it on the West Coast, the San Francisco startup of it all because Victoria's Secret was started in the Bay Area in the late 70s by entrepreneurs. It felt like I had more access to that. And you as a media reporter and also you're more interested in the business of modeling felt like you should focus on the second half. And then there were a couple of things, I'd say the end of it, we sort of worked on together because we were, I was like reporting on it live. And also it just made more sense because the model stuff was really, really tricky, I'd say, and the time period you covered. But early on those in those early days, like what were some of the big revelations for you in terms of like, oh, this book is the book we pitched, but it's going to be different in one way or another. Yeah, I think, I actually think it's surprisingly similar to what we ended up with. And the way that you just described how we did it, I think is was what we had thought out from the outset, perhaps, and then it sort of devolved as everything got more complicated. Like I did a lot of the most of the historical research in all periods of the book and filling in that information. Like sort of as things came up, the art or naive initial plans sort of fell away. But in there were so many different phases of like, it's a tricky book in that it's not just chapter to chapter, they're focusing on different things. If we were missing a period, like we couldn't just let it go, we had to like understand what was happening in that period. So that was part of what was tricky about it to me. But I think we actually were more faithful to the original proposal than I assumed we would be going into it. And we really made the book that we set out to make, which was one that aimed to explain how fashion works through this company, through this really innovative brand, and really focus on that and make kind of the inside baseball of fashion easy to understand and read. And I think we really achieved that. And part of what was so fun in the research process was talking to people who had never talked to a reporter before. I think that was one of my fears, because the story had been covered a lot. And then every time I called someone who they're like, Oh, no one's ever called me, like, how is that possible? So that part of it was really fun to me. But it was really intense and hard. So much outreach, so many emails, cold calling, and trying to show people that we know something about this business and that we're not out to just completely smear whatever they want to tell us.

One of the things I'm most proud of, and we didn't get everybody, there's one executive who I'm not going to name this person here, but if they're listening or their family's listening, we still really respect and wish we could have talked to them. But there was one executive where I was invited to an event where they were speaking. And so we used it to ambush them. So we both went, yes, for no other reason but to talk to this person. And honestly, it worked. This person was incredibly helpful, is quoted in the book, and went on the record. And I spoke to a source who I know is going to listen to this. So shout out, much love to them. He said, you know, I read the book. There was a lot I didn't agree with, but I also think you did a really good job. And that was honestly, that's the best feeling for these people who gave a lot of themselves and gave us a lot of information. It was a good feeling to, I knew people would talk because a lot of this stuff happened 30 years ago. So the longer, further away it is from the thing happening, the less fear people have, what I I don't know if it's a concern. But what I think I was a little concerned about was the fact that like there is just so much information. And how do we organize it in a way that is compelling? That was certainly the hardest part, because there's so much happening simultaneously. Yeah. And I think in the end, you're right, like it is crazy how close it is to the proposal. And the one thing that we, you and I have talked about a lot that we, I think we figured out pretty early in the reporting process, but just kept being reinforced was the narrative that had kind of gone around a bit about Victoria's Secret, which was that it was run by all these men who just like to like have models walking around in underwear. And they were like gross people who were misogynists and they just were trying to sell. They hated fat women. They hated everybody who wasn't blonde and white, like, and they were just trying to sell this image of beauty that was unrealistic and really dangerous. And that had sort of been the, what everybody said about Victoria's Secret. And I think you and I both went into it thinking, I think generally, most people are complicit when they, they'll say later, oh, I didn't like something. I thought it was terrible. But then they actively participated. And I have been to a lot of those shows where people were into it and we were all as consumers buying it. Consumer behavior is participation. So, yes, looking back, could you say that a lot of the marketing and messaging they put out was misogynistic? Absolutely. Did it feel that way at the time? Not to everyone who was working on it. A lot of people thought they were empowering women by saying, hey, go out and buy yourself bra and underwear or what have you. Yeah, like bra and underwear. Here's a way to be in touch with your sexuality. But no, I think you and I both felt like we wanted to, we didn't want to put a slant on it. We wanted to explain what it meant at the time to have this ad or have this commercial. What else was going on? What was the larger context? And yeah, and talk about how a women consumers loved this brand. And you can interrogate why. There's a lot there. And also women were really powerful within this brand. Did they have the ultimate power? No, but there was really interesting women executives there. It's a really interesting story of like, how much did Victoria's Secret influence the culture or reflect it? And fundamentally, they wanted to make money and they certainly did. That was the main aim. So, what sort of cultural levers were they pulling to do that and where were they pulling them from? That's also interesting to investigate, but it's just a much more complicated story than like, men forced this brand upon America. It wouldn't have been $8 billion market share leader for decades if that was the case because it's just not that simple. For sure. So, we actually have another call in three minutes, which we can be a little late for this call, I think. But it's a press call. So, how has it been so far? So, as I said at the top of this, when this runs, we all have gone through the like real hell of it. We've already taped two TV segments. We're supposed to do two more on Tuesday. We're doing a ton of interviews. We've already done what, like four or five interviews or we've done a couple podcasts. We're doing more podcasts next week. Then we go to LA. We're going to have a run of stuff. Then we're going to go to Chicago. We have so much. Chicago is crazy. Like we have three events plus TV plus, I think we have four of it, four or five events actually. It's a lot. So, what has it been like for you? I've experienced this a lot more being at Puck where people are really interested in Puck and they're interested in what I'm doing there. So, I've gotten like way more press in the, I've been doing like a lot more interviews than I ever did at BOF. And also, the ones at BOF are really just about topics. Whereas here, it's like been more about me, which is kind of weird and hard to process. It's like a person who like most writers loves attention but doesn't actually want attention or wants attention but doesn't actually like attention. I think that's it. But anyway, what has this like being on the other side of it and trying to explain this to people? How has it been for you? It's been challenging but fun and like just trying to figure out what's the best way to explain like what is the message, what are the messages that we want to get across. I think sometimes we nail it better than others but it's been great to see how much interest there is. Like I didn't really expect it. I mean, I hoped but I didn't expect it by any means. And it's just nice that people want to like celebrate us or interested in talking about it and hearing what we have to say. And again, like everyone has a Victoria Secret story or memory. So there's like always something to connect with. And it's such an interesting time for the brand that they're bringing back the fashion show on October 15th. And it's great timing. And again, an opportunity to talk about this really fascinating business and sort of where does it go from here? Where can it go from here? All very fun things to talk about. Yeah. And I agree. I mean, we got so lucky with the fashion show being next week. It's on the 15th, right? And it's just like incredible timing. And so- I think it has less to do with us and more to do with the election, I would imagine. Yeah. But we got lucky. I don't know if they would consider it lucky but we got lucky. So looking ahead, you have this great job at the cut. You're doing amazing work there. Yeah. It's been really fun. What are your ambitions for another book? Like, do you want to do another one? I think eventually I will. I'm not sure. It was such an intense experience. I think I want to take a break from it and really focus on this job at the cut. Like I left business of fashion was freelance to give more time to working on the book. And my job at the cut is pretty intense. Like I don't know how I would balance those two things. And so yeah, I would think about it. But I think there are other fun and like meaty fashion stories to tell or cultural stories. Yeah. What about you? I will never do one again while I have a full-time job. It's not possible. It's really hard. It was like kind of possible because I took three months off between Puck and BOF and like I baked that in and it Puck came at the exact right time when we needed to send in our first draft. And so it made it or we had already sent a draft in or no, we hadn't. Don't ask me these timeline questions. I just remember I took a month off in July to work on it. That's when I first reached out to someone at Puck being like, because of course, right, I was working on my book and I'm like, I want to, I need a new job. I need to leave my current job. I just like felt it and I was obsessed with Puck. And it's like, I need to go work at this company. So I messaged someone I knew who worked there in July. And then in November, it just turned out that they reached out to me at that time when I was on Booklea again. But I remember saying to John, like, I need three months to finish this because I cannot start this job and not have like at least the first draft of this book done or it's never going to happen. But what I would say is like, if I ever do it again, and I think we both have ambitions would want it, I'd want to do it by myself, like I think I'm sure you feel the same way. I would take a year to do the research and a year to write. And it's just really hard for me as a person. I love news. I love breaking news. It would be really hard. But I have like one thing that I maybe want to do where I just start doing the writing reporting and doing one interview a week. And then like in three years actually write the book or something or take a little that that would allow me to keep working. And just if I do the reporting just if I do the reporting over a really long amount of time, then do the writing. Bill Cohen, who is my my partner at Puck, as we call them, he writes books, any files, two columns a week. And I'm like, I don't understand how you have the time to do this. He also doesn't have a three year old child. So that's like part of it. But yeah, I want to do it. But I also want to see like, what is the impact of this? Because it feels we are both people who are drawn to places and publications that operate in a really modern way. Like I don't think either of us care as much about like the tradition and it's more about like, is this does this publication like operate in a way that feels a sustainable business wise would be that like it actually makes an impact in that culture. And I'm just curious to see if like a book does can be impactful. And if it can sort of change the narrative around something. And if if I feel like that happened, there are a couple things that I just think are like, ready and deserve, they deserve time, but like, it's a big luxury. People who just write books for a living, like most of them are rich. It's just if you don't, you, there's no way around it. It's just the way things are now. So, yes, so my long winded answer is yes, I would like to. But for me, the thing is, am I satisfied in my work? And I would say we both had been at BOF for a long time and really loved it. It's a really good job and an amazing team. And like we helped build this incredible business. But I think we both also were like, what's next? And right now, we're both like, I don't want anything to be next, because this is the best thing that's ever happened career wise. So, so it's interesting. What is just one more thing, because the show is next week. What are you expecting from the runway show? I don't know about expecting, but one thing that I will be looking for, and I'm interested to see, is if they have any non model, like surprise guests. So far, everyone that they've kind of announced or teased has been from the Victoria's Secret universe, like Gigi Hadid, Tara Banks, and I think there's in general less interest in models these days, or like the models that we're interested in, it's a very defined group, like people do not enter their ranks anymore. Probably the last one is like Paloma, and she doesn't have the same fame level as a lot of those women. But I'm curious to see if they mix it up with non models and see if they play with that in the way that like skims has really effectively played in sports and in television. And I think to their advantage in terms of creating cultural conversation, which Victoria's Secret, the models were their thing and they didn't ever want to violate that. But I'm wondering if that's like a feasible long term solution when there aren't new super models being made anymore. Yeah, I mean, I never cared about models. Yeah, I mean, I get that. As you know, it's just not a huge interest of mine. It is like a thing in the fashion industry. There are writers who are like, know every the name of every single model and every, it just, it was never, I mean, I loved Cindy Crawford and House of Style, but that's basically it. But like these, you know, Gigi Hadid is basically a celebrity to a certain age group. Yes. Because she's a model, but, you know, she's just a regular celebrity. People care about her personal life, blah, blah, blah. But I don't know that there's people coming into that space that can have that level of celebrity like she's been having. So, and if they're clearly trying to target a younger audience, which I think is an interesting strategy. But yeah, how do those things work together? I mean, you and I were in the store recently and came across the most adorable group of young girls who were so happy to be there. I was like, do those girls care about, you know, I don't know, whatever model is going to be there, even like Gigi Hadid, do they even know who she is? Like they were almost too young to have experienced that. So I was curious, like, what is that going to mean for them? You know? One quick thing, and then we really will go is the culture so flattened that I think they do care about like Cindy Crawford and Tyra Banks and people like that because you get, they get imagery of those people constantly. And so Tyra Banks is not anything different to them than she was to us. And so like- But we watched America's Next Top Model and they didn't. They don't even have like- But I think they do watch it. Like that's the thing, like I think that like stuff is just all happening at the same time now. So stuff in the 90s, imagery from the 90s is they're receiving it as if it's imagery. As a meme, yeah, I guess. Yes. So that's a, that's a Kyle Chaka conversation. But anyway, Shantel, thank you for joining me and also thank you for doing this book with me. Congratulations. We did it. We're so happy it's out in the world. I can't believe we did it or it's going to be out in the world soon. So and thank you to everyone who's like supported us and asked how it's going and is celebrating. It's released like it means so much to have like a community of people celebrate us. It's crazy. Yeah. It's two people who are like deeply uncomfortable with people being nice to us. Just thank you to everybody. And yeah, I'm so glad we did it. And yeah, I'm so happy. It's great. And we'll talk in five minutes when we go on our next interview. Thank you for being here. Fashion People is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck, hosted by Lauren Sherman. That's me.
