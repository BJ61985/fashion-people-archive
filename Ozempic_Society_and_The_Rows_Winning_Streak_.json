Happy holidays. It was a big week at line sheet this week. Thursday I dug into, met two, lazy, blasey, lazy? We'll find out soon. His appointment at Chanel and all the speculation around that and what it could mean for caring. Sounds like they may already have a successor lined up at Bottega Veneta, or at least they are close. You can go online sheet to find out who the names are. Also, Rachel Trugatz, our beauty correspondent, looked at the state of beauty M&A. We thought there was going to be a very big exit this year. Instead, we've had some nice exits. It's still, you know, December is not over. People love doing deals over the holidays, so that might still happen. But I guess the big takeaway from that story, and you should read it because Rachel has all the reporting and details. But big congrats to Sarah Gibson Tuttle, who sold her nail polish and nail care brand all of in June to Helen of Troy for a bunch of money. What a story. It started out as some cool salons, and she got into product really quickly, closed the salons during the pandemic, never reopened them. And now, you know, she sold this thing for hundreds of millions of dollars. And I'm very excited. I've known Sarah for a really long time, and I'm very excited for her. I'm excited for the people who had equity in that biz. There weren't that many. So I think they all did pretty well. Like, love to see it. I also have news on the Condé layoffs, or as they are calling it, a reorganization connected to restructuring on the business side. Sure. There's also some funny stuff about people really mad because apparently Roger Lynch, the CEO, sent out an email saying you have to be in the office four days a week, which look, I agree with Roger. You should all be in the office four days a week. Sorry. I don't know what you all are doing at home. Why would you want to be at home? Especially if you live in New York City. It's it's cramped like go to the office. Anyway, I also had a little news on changes at Paris Vogue. And then I also covered this Mr. Bernard Arnault's induction into this prestigious learned society in France, which is very interesting. And I think it's actually quite a charming story, a little funny, but mostly charming. Oh, and I did my guide to gift guides. That was really fun. I hope you enjoyed that or enjoyed if you haven't looked at it yet. And our new correspondent, Sarah Shapiro starts next week. So if you have any retail or shopping stories or investigations you want her to do, just send her a note on social and she'll be as Shapiro at Puck Dot News. So you could email her there too. And I hope you enjoy this interview with Anna, who is nothing if not unfiltered and shares her opinions about all the brands high and low, what they're doing right, what they're doing wrong. And it was super fun. Hope you have a restful weekend. Anna Angelic, welcome to Fashion People. Thanks for having me, Lauren. Pleasure to be here. What did you have for breakfast this morning? I didn't have breakfast yet. Me neither. I know, but it's like nine o'clock your time. Yeah. What time is it your time? It's almost one. I'm going to be hangry on this spot because I'm kidding. I'm not. Did you have a late dinner? No. It's just that I can't like I just eat once a day. Honestly, like don't like just that one big thing in the day like Bruce Springsteen. Like this is this is the key. This is the key. This is why all those people who are on GLP ones are thin because they eat one meal a day. Are you flying the time? No, you're definitely not. It's very clear. You're naturally thin. Slash take care of yourself. But I'm saying that it is a thing that I think a lot more people have started to do because of GLP ones and they just eat or they see these people. They're like, well, the key is like eating. I think look like those also make you produce more insulin and there's a lot more science. And if you are overweight, it makes it easier to lose weight no matter what. But the key, I think there are a lot of people who do get questioned about it and who are like, oh, I just stopped eating as much, which is an interesting like, oh, you could also just do that instead of going on a drug. I think it's social contagion, but I will say I was never a breakfast person and because I'm European, we have big lunch and we don't eat small dinners. And so that is I'm just kind of like, I'll just do my thing. Sorry, Brian, my husband, like I'm not going to eat with you because I just don't I'm not hungry. You know, why do they eat it? But definitely social contagion. But honestly, Lauren, I don't know if you like I go to Tracy Anderson and the amount of bad or something bodies. I know it's it's I don't know. Like those people really think they look good. I don't know. I haven't really when I think about it, the people that I've observed on Osempic because I don't really go to a lot of Boutique classes. I do go to some, but they're in like Pasadena with 20 year olds who are definitely not on Osempic and make me feel really bad about myself. But but I tend to go to like in Hollywood to with like a lot of young girls. So I'm not are you at at the Tracy Anderson and Tribeca with all the Tribeca moms? I'm 59th. Oh, OK. I mean, same side. Yeah, it's younger girls who look worse than older ones. Yeah. Yeah, I think the thing that it does, it's funny. A friend of mine was like, did you end up doing it? Because I during my book tour, I was like thinner than I normally am by I would say five pounds. And I said, no, like sometimes I think I should just do that would be a lot easier. Yes. But I have not done it because I am one of these people who wants to like take care of myself myself and be healthy and all that stuff. But then she said. Well, I didn't think you had because your face is still full. Like it's not like I guess it really gets you in the cheek area and also the butt area, which is like. And arms. Oh, yeah. Like the bones. Yeah. Bones. It's that is the off. So basically have like fake boobs hanging like it's not a good look. And also the arms are really skeletal. So it's the neck that gets me. Oh man. Oh, everyone has their own thing. Yeah. Look, like I am very pro people feeling good and being healthy. And if you have to do that, go for it. And if you want to get work done to supplant like whatever, everybody has their thing, but it's it is very interesting to observe. And you are a cultural anthropologist. So to see it is is fascinating. And I think the thing you said, like it's just it's made it okay to be thin again. Like it's made it okay to not eat a lot. Whereas from I'd say the last 15 years, you go to a dinner and you don't eat. You don't take a piece of bread. People are like fully judging you like very much. You have to eat, eat, eat, eat, eat. And so there is, I mean, this is all balance. And I'm just curious to see what happens to these people physically in 15 years. You know what? That's the thing. And like we can get off the topic, but for me, aesthetically, it's like there's so many people like I like I'm not young anymore. So I don't see well. So when I look on Instagram, I think everyone is a Kardashian. And they're not because that's the same like like everyone looks like, you know, the same. And I wonder if it's like this is not new, but I just think aesthetically, it's, you know, how there was again, like aesthetic and ethics. So it was a value judgment if you didn't eat bread. Yeah, it was body positivity and so on. So but now because aesthetic change also like, oh, but you don't have self discipline, you know, you know, like again, I feel like fashion is going now like, you know, pendulum, you know, swings. I think it's confusing, to be honest. It is. And it's also, I remember I spent, I think it was like five and a half months in Paris in 2019. And I didn't go back to the U.S. at all during that time. And I actually maybe went to the UK once or twice, but was really only in Europe during that period. And really noticed like the way people take care of their faces in France. And you just spend more time with French people and women in particular and also their bodies and working out and all that stuff. And then I remember going to the UK for like two weeks right after I left. And it was a culture shock because Kardashian body was like at its peak. And I had forgotten about it because in France, everybody was still just like, I don't eat. I eat when I'm hungry. I'm not going to eat that much and I want to be thin. Whereas in the UK and in the U.S. It was really about like, how can I get like a really big butt? And and so they totally changed physical aesthetics. And now, yeah, it's like there are still people who look like that. But then there are also these people who are trying to look really small. And then obviously there is also this trend with a lot of weightlifting and a lot of protein. Like eating so much protein that I'm like, I don't think it's physically possible for me to eat this. And I don't understand how I would ingest all this food. If it was going to make me thinner, maybe I'll try. But like, I don't think I can. And then the weightlifting like that, I think, you know, over 40 is important. But it is crazy. Like the amount of stuff I get fed on Instagram. I don't really do TikTok, but like about macro, macro, macro, lift, weight, lift, weight, deadlifts, deadlifts, deadlifts. And suddenly it's just all so it's just an interesting. There are so many parallels between like physical activity and wellness and fashion and like the clothes that people are wearing and how they connect back to this. I don't know when you are consulting or when you're advising or working at a brand, like how much are you looking at like the changes in physicality to inform like what items you're buying and all of that. That's, I mean, I love the pivot. And just one more thing, like I saw the substance last night and I got traumatized and I was thinking funny. You mentioned French women because I was thinking about French actresses that are six years. Isabel Iper, Isabella Diabini, you know, like plastic and they look like, you know, so it's kind of definitely like a lifestyle. So I would say that brands that I worked with at Banana, it's pretty, Mansoor Gabriel, Rebecca Minkow. It was definitely especially at Gap brands. It's more of a like, I don't want to sound cynical or something, but it's kind of like that body positivity and those plus sizes were almost like not political statement, but yeah, but but the statement of a non at Esprit as well, not just not just Gap. I would say at big mass apparel brands, like let's say like that. It's it's almost you want to do that because you have to. Yeah, to go up and which I think also if you consider US market, obviously there are differences. If you are say like Esprit Europe, PN sizing, you'll have to adjust to US sizing. Or if you are a brand like Gap, which has a mass market, you do want to be aware of what is the average size and adjust to that. So these are obviously good merchandising decisions, good product decisions. But they're also box checking. Yeah, it's box checking. And then it feels when they should be doing it because they found a really cool, beautiful model and it doesn't matter which size she is. They're doing it because they're like we need a certain size model and we need models of these five different ethnicities and we need like and that's when it starts to feel really. But you also have to do that, Lauren. You really like that is like I say have to do that because at the same time, you're kind of right in the wrong. You know, and they're beautiful people diverse. And you sort of if you're if even if you're not a mass brand right now, I'm I'm I've been working for five, six months with the footwear brand. And it's it's it's a default. It's a default. We live in a diverse world and you do need to represent that in your in your campaign. So tell me a little bit. Let's rewind and how how you became so knowledgeable on this topic. Like, let's talk about your background and and you are we met years ago. You you're a writer. You've written two books, your new book hit makers, how brands influence culture is coming out imminently. And you have also been a CMO and a lot of different companies. It's great. And mostly in the fashion industry. But how did you kind of end up doing that as your gig? Well, 10 years ago or 11 years ago, I went to create a group from Droga five and create a group at the time was building websites for luxury fashion beauty lifestyle brands, hospitality brands, but in luxury space. And that's 11 years ago. And you have to like brands are not very comfortable selling ten thousand dollar wedding dress or, you know, fifty thousand dollar jewelry online. Yeah. Well, at that time. So that was the create the group. I remember it. James. Oh, my God, James, he's doing well. He's in too long. Shot for him. James. Yeah, shout out to James. Oh, my God. Love James. We love you. We love you to this day. Like, you can't be done. It's doing really well. Oh, nice. That's fabulous. Yeah. He found his he's calling after, you know, create the group. So that, you know, it was it was so it was a good place to be because I wanted to work with brands who have outsized cultural influence without necessarily understanding the business, the audience, the technology of the modern consumers. And the business models that came out of it. So after that, it was spring studios when they expanded in the U.S. It was a global role and that was super fun because like milk studios, there is like a studios attached and then again, very discerning clients. And then it was a global senior vice president position at Havas Lux hub. And that's where it was part of Havas network. LVMH entire portfolio, Sotheby's the biggest clients. And Havas is a big advertising agency. Right. Top five holding companies owned by Vivendi, which has canal plus and an universal. So they have media and creative part and their, their Paris counterpart, BTC is works with a lot of luxury brands is the go to creative agency. So I was always mostly in luxury, but then in the sense in order to learn how to manage large teams, how to lead large teams, I had to go to mass retail or premium, if you will. So hence, as pre banana republic when you go in and you have 150 people and then 50 people in design. And that was that bigger canvas that I felt I needed to do my career before going back to luxury. And so what are you working on now? You said you're consulting for a footwear brand and I have a couple of other clients, furniture client and a jewelry client. So, you know, there is always fun things to do always. And there is this book to promote now and which is exciting. Paris December 9th. If you're in Paris, you'll provide the link. I hope Lauren. Yeah, of course. You can register. Thank you. And then in London hosted by list at the end of January and then Sydney and Melbourne and then New York as well. So that and then just to also answer a question in a sense, what is next luxury space is next and very, very, very, very, very considered about my next move. Yeah, because I sort of feel like check the boxes and now let's. Yeah, let's do this. Let me just got it. Let's get kids. I'm going to do some of those studies from pre K through 12th grade and it's actually fun, engaging personalized and packed with encouraging feedback to help keep them motivated. I Excel is used by 96 of the top 100 school districts in the U.S. And it's no surprise it's backed by research.

So you during your time at these these bigger companies, you you wrote another book. So tell me about your first book and how it informed the topic of this book and and when you had time to do this because writing a book is not. It's not easy. Quo it. So that was the first book and I started my newsletter. The sociology of business is a way to force myself to write every week. So that was the motivation actually January, February 2020. And because everything was shut down, there was nothing but time and it was all I always find in my career is always good to have a time out in between. Yeah, and reassess and reset and see so that that book, the business of aspiration. The first one was actually my learnings from the previous period working with agencies at and at smaller. Fashion premium. Yeah, the brands as a chief brand officer to say hey, but like what do we know about how people spend their money? What they want? How they spend their time and what is aspirational for them? How they see status above all because luxury is all about that signaling. So that first book was really about the new areas of aspiration in culture like taste, curation, knowledge, experiences, information, memberships and how does that influence. Brand strategy. So it was it was a wider sweep that had proven to be useful in terms of specific tools that I that I kind of throughout my work. So what is important to mention here is that everything I write about is first done. It's first. It's based on my experience. It's first practice. And then and you know when you like maybe you don't know because you work for a news agency, but at brands you actually the most important thing is to move always move, move, move. You don't have time to thank you think. Yeah. So you do a lot of things either instinctively or strategies are made on the go. So it's important to have time to kind of reassess what worked. What didn't work? What how decisions we make what strategies work. So that's what my second book is about. It's my my work at our work at Banana Republic and as pre what the teams have done merchandising product design marketing teams and how the influence culture, not through devising brand campaigns, not through brand marketing, but through cultural influence strategies. So the book has basically three parts. The importance of storytelling overall. I'm not saying anything new, but I'm setting the stage to say that the story is told through cultural products. Yeah, through mass advertising and then that media planning has become amplification of cultural moments which changes how media is bought and and and sold. So again, very practical book. Yeah. Contextualized. So give me an example of a cultural moment that a brand has made that is then amplified through through the marketing. Absolutely. I mean, I can give you banana example and I can give you external examples. Yeah. And then it was when three months, four months in the in the tenure. We relaunched the archive, for example, and now it's easy to say that, but it was like four years ago. You know, like, whatever, three years ago. And I'm mentioning that because we got a lot of press for that. Yes. And people are like, oh my God, you know, now everyone is doing that. But it in the sense was like, what if and you know why more people are not doing it? It's not that people don't have ideas. It's that it's operationally hard to execute. So I'm nothing but thankful to amazing supply and production people at Banana Republic and merchandising people who quickly figured out how to assign skews to those wins. Yeah. Honestly, it does come to that. It does when when when you have ideas and then other examples are, for example, LLB just their hero product, their thought bag was literally just released with TB with the belt. Super simple idea, super impactful. Yeah. That is an example of how do you create something? Stone Island is killing it. Right. It in the past years with like not only their amazing content and advertising, but also what they did. It was like, oh, like, let's look back at the archives. It's a simple idea again, but it's so much better than what you see. I don't have a magazine now, but like, you know, in in fashion magazines. Well, let me ask you this. When you look at something like and I remember when you did that Banana Republic reissuing and had all these vintage pieces available to buy online. That felt like it felt like some a bunch of people really hunted for those pieces. Refreshed like dry clean them or whatever to make sure that they didn't smell bad and sold them at a premium through Banana, which I think is a great way to get people interested in the brand again and remember why they know what the brand is. But when when you look at something like Abercrombie and Fitch, which has completely like they have an amazing. They could do I mean, you can buy Abercrombie sweaters that probably cost $45 at retail for like $250 of vintage stores now. Like everything, it would be the cargo pants, everything from like the late 80s and up to the mid 2000s would probably be really coveted if someone had sort of freshened it up. But instead, Abercrombie has taken a totally different strategy where they don't have there's no sense of its past at all. And they are just making super trendy clothes that like when you look at the building blocks, its jeans and shirts and all that like the kind of same kind of stuff they sold. But there's no heritage whatsoever. I went in the other day and they did have some rugby shirts, but like nothing else looked like anything that would have been sold at Abercrombie when we were growing up. So what do you think about that strategy and how does it connect back to what you're talking about? Well, it does help when the CEO is not accused of sexual trafficking. Yeah, sure. I mean, that helps. Well, that helps. And also when have you seen the advertising from the 90s? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's like orgies. Yes. All right. I mean, I was a teenager in in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania during that period. I was very familiar with the advertising and the catalog and all. But when you look at them now, you're actually it's cringe, not enough, you know, like it's kind of like, whoa, you know, it's kind of like you're uncomfortable for those people. But like anyway, that's Bruce Weber fantasy or what. Yeah. That's sad. That's sad. That is a very, very, very considered aesthetically considered brand world that yes, they moved away from let's leave this all aside. Is that I've said it once. I'll say retail is a product business. Retail is a merchandising business. Yes. Marketing and brand that's nice. If you have a strong brand and so on, that matters in luxury in the space that other probably plays in and a lot of mass premium brands play in product, product, product, product, merchandising, merchandising, merchandising. So they fix their product. It fits better. The quality is better. The sizing is better. And they have that chase model that they're like, hey, if you know that women or girls, they want dresses during summer, we're going to have a lot of dresses to choose from. So in a sense, it's brand doesn't matter. And aesthetically, they are going to go. What is popular? So now the question that always is, yes, at what at a certain scale, you can definitely compete like that. But if you then want to grow, you're never going to outperform Sien or Zara or H&M or others. So you know what I mean? It's a matter of strategy. At some point you're going to need a brand again. And the brand is for sort of the hero products that are sold year after year after year and evolved essentially. It's the product pyramid. It's hero products is your foundational products for LLB. Hero product is a tote bag. It's a boat shoe is the famous boots. So they have that. So they all they have to do is riff. They can play with that. It's that product led branding. And then what are foundational pieces? A really good jacket, a really good pair of pants, a really good knitwear. So that is what NOS never out of stock. That's what you repeat. And then you have collection. That's what your interpretation of seasonal trends. That's how we revive this pre for a minute through kind of like seeing what were the iconic products from the eighties. But then having a very flexible foundation and then very considered collection. Yeah. And so a company like Abercrombie at some point, if they want to keep growing, we'll need to figure out what their foundation and their hero products are. Because right now they don't really have them. They have, I mean, they have jeans and the jeans are. I think they have jeans. They have t-shirts. They have, you know, the basics, I guess that people still go there because they fit well. They're made of better quality than Zara, for example. So I think that is, I think, like if I were any of those brands, I would be afraid of Uniqlo because Uniqlo survived thanks to their very strong Asian business, especially in Japan. So they were not profitable in the U.S. But they have such a massive company that they could, they had a buffer, but now they're making money in the U.S. And now they have clear right killer. And so now like they're known for basics, quality basics. People wear Uniqlo and Hermès. Yeah. For 100%. You know, so I think that is, and they are very smart in their collaborations. Yeah. So that's a good model if you want a kind of not bizarre, not Bichierne and still have scale. So looking at something like Uniqlo, which my assumption has always been because they did start to turn things around in the U.S. and things have, they performed well, but they like recalibrated their store, their store footprint, all that. My feeling about them has always been like, they have everything but the advertising. Like the collaborations are good. So that's good marketing, but and the product is good. And it's such a word of mouth product. Like people in the fashion industry have been wearing heat tech for 10 years. And if you want something, you go to Uniqlo. It's such a, I remember the first time I took my mom to a Uniqlo, she was like, oh my God, this is amazing. Like she had, she didn't know about it because she did live, I don't, they may have one in Pittsburgh now, but they didn't have one where she was going shopping. And she was like, this is like, it reminded her of old gap, which is what she wanted. But how much do you think it matters that their advertising is weird? Does it though? Because again, it's so. Do you think it matters? No. I always say there are two things, discoverability and deserability. So advertising builds desire and your product needs to be discoverable. So you have two jobs, make it desirable and maybe make it easy to discover. If you do that without advertising, you know, you just, you know what I mean? It's like, because I think what they do have is the range of ages. My mom loves Uniqlo. She buys cashmere there. She was like, oh, I love this JW Anderson bag or you know, like, so. It's kind of, you don't need a reason to tell people go to Uniqlo. Every time I go, like by that story in Soho, it's always packed and most of them are not. Yeah. So advertising comes in when you need to push product, when you're rebranding, when you have like, it needs to be deployed strategically. If it's working without it, like why? Yeah, it's almost like not having advertising is as big of a student. They almost should just not bother doing it. Correct. It's like best kept secret that everyone knows about. Like if a person who wears Hermes was like, oh, I just have Uniqlo and Hermes or Uniqlo and Dior. Yeah. That is the best advertiser you're going to get. You almost have luxury advertising. Yeah. Essentially what you're saying is the product is the marketing. The product is the marketing. If you figure out that what they call product led branding, put the product the center of your brand universe and people who wear it, like look at Levi's, Doc Martin's, LL Bean. And the Birkenstocks, come on, Crocs. These are all core products and then build a brand around it, which means collaborate, build merch, tell a story around it, build a con even Stone Island. Yeah. Even North Face. Look at their schemes collaboration. Yeah. Yeah. Know what your hero products are and just build a world around it. Yeah.

You also work with luxury brands and have been doing more in that space and have dipped in and out of it. The luxury industry right now is sort of in this weird situation where a lot of the mega luxury brands, people are still buying tons of stuff, but they feel they don't feel like can as connected to the culture as they had for the last 15 years. What do you think is happening in that space and what needs to change? I mean, okay, so I understand what has been I'll start from what has been happening was exactly what should have been happening if you want to grow, which is get into new markets, open new stores, maximize your market presence. So that is a fashion strategy. It's not necessarily a luxury strategy. But then again, if you don't pursue as a luxury brand that strategy, then you're going to end up like in the nineties with incompetent heirs or or elderly founders or bankrupt brands because luxury by definition is something the very few people can have. It's it's it's limited availability. Yeah. So that is but we can talk about modern luxury and the modern soft power, which brings a new product strategy and the new merchandising strategy, which is all about if luxury is having something that not a lot of other people have, then in terms of your merchandising that clearly you distribute per channel, your products differently. I remember me, me is killing it. Yeah. Although they increased their prices many fold as as Prada did as an others did. They have one size. Yeah. For shoes. So I've been chasing around Europe that pair and you know why because it was not available. That is what luxury is. That's what that soft power is from Milan to Paris to Canada back to Milan. You know, and I'm not saying I'm not unique at all by far. So if you have that illusion of scarcity through your portfolio, merchandising and through your distribution and through your product design. So it's almost like what Supreme used to do when it was hot 20 years ago. It's like such a limited drops of things. So everyone has this. Everyone is wearing the same brand, but not to not two people have the same thing. Yeah. I think that needs to happen now. I'm not saying anything is right and wrong. Luxury brands did what they had to do to reach the scale they wanted in terms of business growth, but to grow further, they need to start diversifying internally. Well, it's interesting because Prada, the last runway show and who knows the real reason they did this. They had a great sort of story that they told about every single model had a different pair of shoes and they were all archival and they said it was about like tricking the algorithm and you don't know what's going to come next. A great story. Reality is it was a greatest hit of like basically every shoe they've ever made and now they can produce all of them. It was a very clever and who knows why, but that is a case of it. I was talking about this with someone the other day where Prada is really one of the few and you knew few brands where the runway actually matters. For commercial because the runway is so inspiring and people are so into it that they want to buy the stuff on the runway. There are so few brands that I think about that like that people want to buy the stuff on the runway. It's just so rare and they are able to it was very clever because in and I just thought of it as like a total commercial play. But when you talk about it being about having a lot of different options, I think it's a good point. You need that and you need to be there the same with the road the same with Kate the same with Hermes the same. So what I would say again going back to product Prada and new me had had the product innovation like luxury brands or fashion luxury brands of the old they changed her people dressed from Chanel to Saint Laurent suit to Bottega to Balenciaga. They have their for your they have their signature shapes. I feel the Prada is probably the only one who is doing that right now. Yeah, the micro micro skirt and oversized and you know what I mean? They have they are setting they're changing how people dress. They're setting trends and that's product innovation and then of course smart merchandising comes in because they have their best sellers. What you say the foundation and then hero and so on. So like what they have hero is what is on the runway. Yeah. What do you think of the Phoebe Filo rollout and and product strategy because she was for a really long time the one who was changing the way people she she kind of set the tone for how people still dress 15 years ago. I think her clothes are still unbelievably covetable. I would say that I don't think that her rollout is. I do appreciate the sort of drops. Yeah, in a sense that she probably produce it help her. It helps a small company production. So that's it. There is a business reason for that and I do think that people appreciate because there's so few of those items that are made. So that's true luxury in a sense and but then at the same time like I didn't understand the Bergdorf for example and I just think that she has such a cloud such a soft power she can literally she can she can do one boutique physical boutique in Paris and still be like make it like a cathedral pilgrim. She doesn't even need. So I don't almost don't don't think that her rollout matters because as long as her products are good people are going to be buying. Yeah, I think that it it's taking longer. You can feel the effect of that first collection on other products and other designers already but it's different from when she was at LVMH where the example I always uses I worked right around the corner from I believe it the store at the Celine starting green or I think it's Green Street. I worked right around the corner from there for years on I think it was like broom and green or something like that somewhere down down there and I would go in probably three days a week and just do a kind of spin and then I would buy something usually I mostly I would say lean. Well, you know, can I afford it or do I buy it is a question but on sale like I would wait their sale was after Christmas so I would buy one thing after Christmas I have a blazer that I bought that I still wear from one of the last collections and I have like I bought one of the chunky sweaters I bought. I have some pants that I got from Nordstrom like a lot of pants for 200 bucks really deeply on sale but the thing is when the collector when her first collection came out I immediately bought something I wanted to have one thing. I haven't bought any I bought a bag I ended up selling it to a friend not for profit but just like because it wasn't right for me and the shirt is great. It's very not right for LA so I don't wear it a ton but I did buy it because the stuff that I bought from her previously I still wear 1012 years later but the thing was there was that opportunity to go there and look again and again and again and again and again and I think what was challenged and look she they had investment from LVMH but this was she owns the majority of the company with her husband it was on their terms and they wanted to do it their way. I think when you look back would it have made sense for them to buy like rent a really cheap store in London Paris. That's what I think she's like definitely I think she would make bigger if it's something when you go when you make a pilgrimage to your look and look and look like okay so this is gonna like when you go to Paris you certainly have certain stores that you visit and look and so on because they're designed so I think I agree with you 100% I mean that's that is better than but I would say her site is beautiful it's beautifully photogenic model model selection is amazing styling is amazing lighting everything the other direction fantastic so yes have but I absolutely I still have a lot of faith that they can work it out and or a lot of hope that they can work it out because it is there are so few designers doing really original things seeing of people who are not doing super original stuff but are have a lot of impact what do you think of how the row manages all of this stuff like they they are obviously very profitable very well considered company that women in America in particular I'd say in Europe it's a little different but are really drawn attracted to their product by things for full price all the time everything is very expensive what do you think about their pricing strategy they are like merchandising strategy they have so many skews hot why do you think they've been so successful especially coming out of the pandemic which was really tough for them because they were a big Barney's client so they lost a lot of money when Barney's closed and then they were just really challenged in the first year to of the pandemic and then things then it blew up but why do you think they've been so successful from the like cultural impact perspective you know what I think I think that first of all they're like in all like if you go to Lagar son half of the story is Dries half of the story is to them like third third third is the row and the shoes like but they play they have so many skews as you said and I do think what they're in the over street market and so on so even if Barney's has gone they have a loyal customer and I think that that retailers underestimate me like depending where you play you underestimate the importance of existing customers and increasing average order value and purchase frequency for those customers and I think that every order value increase if you add categories of bags pants and like that's why they have those skews so it's a complete closet of row so that's that's one and then their pricing point I don't think it changed that much they hit the ground running with extremely high prices and I think it's overall look at their Instagram that's going to give you a hint that they don't create fashion they create works of art that's their positioning because their entire Instagram they never show their stuff they show their curation they have art in their stores expensive art in their stores they're you know so and they're very invisible they're not front and center they're not their brand ambassadors here and there you have Jennifer Lawrence had to you know like they know their audience Jennifer Lawrence is married for the art yeah yeah you know I mean you play in a different space so I don't think a price matters at all for their clients what matters is that they know what they're gonna find there repeatedly that's how they make money I don't know their financials but I suspect that 80% is existing clients 20s new ones yeah yeah that's interesting so and and probably 80% of sales come from the top 2% clients then you exactly and I would say like maybe we're talking about Phoebe Fiello and not having a store maybe we're just not inviting she probably has a studio when she has invitation she definitely has a studio but I don't think it has been I think they've gotten much better at it but the she has events in New York LA Paris I don't know about Milan London where she has people and before she launched she invited pre Celine clients to come in and buy but and that's fine for like for but but we both know that another reason the row is so successful is because a lot of people buy it secondhand on the real real oh you know you can you can go to TJ Maxx and do the row seriously there's some there is some jeans there because I don't know who their sellers are at that marketplace but thousand percent I mean thousand percent like you have like the amount of discounting and that is the crazy thing and by the way congratulations on hiring Sarah Shapiro and that's the other thing that they kind of I look forward to reading thanks she's great yeah why I'm saying that is that there is that fashion sub-stack that is actually bringing back the middle yeah that doesn't that like middle middle is a middle because they don't have this massive marketing budget but they may have amazing product they're just small and they're just local 10 million 200 million and you have those curators not just Sarah but magazine may Amelia Preetraka and others who are basically the job of affiliate links in curation so they bring that for I would say that little should pay attention to middle is back yeah in a sense that once you have you have perplexity shop once your algorithm gets a hang of me saying hey I want to pay me a mule offers in black in size 37 and a half give me more give me more give me more that is gonna be a window before all of that gets monetized like Google did when like a lot of meat brands are gonna get a chance to be discovered so and why am I bringing that up with the luxury is the amount of sales that do you know that you can literally I bought a dress or not and bag for 450 it's 750 at Lagerson so you know what I mean I'm not I want to pay a full price but if I Google it and Google gives me those options I'm also an economic preacher yeah of course and no one's gonna pay more when you can pay less for the same thing so that's what I'm saying I'm not surprised but I don't think it's unique for it for the role I don't think it's unique I think it's across the board that you have satire it tell is do you have a lot of those that help you find for less and even just Google it and you're gonna have price comparison which is the what I think the platforms flatten everything so as we move into this next phase where you're saying that the mega brands really need to start diversifying to feel original again and there's still going to be like price comparison and discounting and all those things none of that's going away and then on top of that just like that all the economic stuff that's going to happen this year with potentially with tariffs but also people sort of waiting on China to be to get back what are your predictions for how the luxury market in particular but also just fashion brands generally are gonna move in terms of how they communicate with their customers what they offer their customers like where is the industry at large moving towards us believe it or not because with the China I mean it's not surprising it's kind of with the China sort of slowing down they're like you know who has money Americans do let's see what but like traditionally those brands like LVM agent carrying their headquarter in Paris and they always looked at the US market as provinces yeah you know in and and also Americans don't as they're gonna buy LL being booed but they're not necessarily by Louis or something if they're not super familiar they're spending money differently and also Americans don't think they're rich even there maybe 1% or 0.01% there is always so it's kind of different perception this is different consumption of luxury but I do think now that that with the growth of luxury brands that happen say in past 10 years global growth that this is actually a fertile market the problem is the discount in the US versus Europe because it's much deeper here than anywhere else so you said Americans don't think they're rich I think like that's interesting but I will we'll wrap up soon but dig into that because I agree with you but tell me explain what you mean by that. I will tell you that you have three homes they're gonna consider themselves upper middle class they have like incredibly inheritance to live to their it's just the consumption habits and then perception is always there is someone who is richer than you so I saw that first has been my in-laws. Yeah yes I see this a lot when people I know sell a company and they have a lot of money and they're like I'm still not rich. They're still saying they're like oh no you're like they're not like. And I'm like that's fine I mean I think of myself as being rich I'm definitely not like definitely can't afford to be a price B.B. Filo but but like I think I feel very lucky that like I am able to have a mortgage and a Volvo like that's good for me but I see it a lot with people I know who grew up upper middle class and now are have a lot more and they're like it's not that much it is you know it is it's all relative right. Yeah that's not saying like keeping up with the Joneses but they're just like yes I guess like relatively and then the other thing is when I was skiing in Vale like I don't know 10 years ago or something on those lifts like in Europe you would see in Courchevel all branded stuff. Here no you would see like local brands that are really warm it doesn't really matter so it's kind of like the status signaling is oh I have a wood brick or pizza oven in my backyard my house is like this size I have five cars or whatnot it's not how many Chanel bags I have. Yeah and so do you think that's going to change or do you think that means that the luxury brands have to tweak the way they operate in order to get more people interested here. Well I think it's changing with the new generation of welfare with the younger ones they are looking more at how they're counting. Look at the China for example it doesn't have a lot of like but I do think there is I've seen it among my friends who are more affluent than I am they are buying luxury brands but I'm not seeing with older generation boomers maybe Gen X as much who are equally more affluent but they just don't there's not a way to spend money. No how embarrassing how embarrassing to buy a luxury. How insecure how insecure do you have to be to have five Chanel bags. Yes I actually heard that from someone. I believe oh yeah I have one vintage. I have one Chanel bag that I bought in 2010 when I was making $67,000 a year. Look at you. Hey dress for success how you want to be. You know all I wanted Anna when I grew up was to move to New York City and work at a fashion magazine and own a Chanel bag and I remember envisioning an apartment that was empty with no furniture but that I would have the Chanel bag and you know it wasn't that far off. There you go. What's your next tell me what's your next inspiration what's your. I just bought a second hand bag from it's my second true luxury bag. I have a bag from the row that I bought in 2017 or so or I was a gift that was not expensive that I still own and wear but I just bought my second luxury bag. It was second hand it was cheaper than anything that is on the market now but yeah I don't I don't really have any more aspirations for products. I just want some I just want to renovate my house. There you go. See so now that's your next you have a newsletter you're building an empire there at Practicals as we can see and you have a book and you have a house in California that's due to be renovated. Yeah thanks for the pep talk Anna. This was great and congratulations on the book. I can't wait to date. I don't have a copy of it. I need to to get it. Yes I'm going to send it to you please do. Yeah please do and everyone who's going to be in Paris should on Monday should go to Anna's party and then also there's going to be with our friends at list something in January and then you're going to do something in New York too right? Yes I am. I hope I'm in there. I would love to have you there so I'll let you. It was great to chat thanks for your words of wisdom and I hope that you get a cool job and that I get the scoop on it. Oh my god. I always find out. We'll talk soon. Thanks a lot and thanks for having me always. It was great thank you.

Each spring 23 Pulitzer Prizes are awarded for distinguished journalism, books, drama, and music. It was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before found out. It was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself?
