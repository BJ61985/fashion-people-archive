Hello and welcome to Fashion People! I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Puck's Fashion and Beauty Memo Line Sheet. And today with me on the show is Lea Chernikov, executive editor of Harper's Bazaar. We're talking New York Fashion Week. We're talking Sarah Burton and Givenchy. We're talking FTC versus Tapestry. And so much more. Let's get started. Hey everyone, hope you're having a great week. I am getting through it. It is Tuesday. It is my last day of Fashion Week. It's not everyone else's. But Tuesday night's the end of it for me. I'm gonna end with Michael Kors. That's my last show and go to some events that night, including the Balenci August store opening in Soho. Then I'm gonna slink away to Puck's offices for our special company meeting. So there will be more disbashes this week. I'll do Wednesday and Thursday, but I'm gonna be slightly offline. And yeah, celebrating Puck's third birthday and all this good stuff. What have I loved that I've seen this week? Monday, I dedicated my entire newsletter to Alaya. But I also talked a bit about my experience at Ralph Lauren and the J Crew dinner that I did not go to, but had a lot of friends kind of call in and let me know how it was and kind of compare and contrast those two businesses, which was fun. I hope you enjoy that. Check it out online sheet. On Sunday, I had the best time. I wrote in the morning, but then I went to Todd Snyder where they had all the models make eye contact with the guests. It may be very uncomfortable. There were some guests who were really into it, but it's just not a typical thing that happens. And it was a little weird. At the end of Tommy Hilfiger, which I thought was like a very good show for Tommy Hilfiger in particular, not to give a backhand a compliment, but there you go. At the end of the show, Wu Tang came out, which was also very fun. And then I went up to Wes Gordon and Paul Arnholdtels for cocktails with the Pooj people, which was very, very nice. Wes and Paul are really nice people and have a nice house and was fun to see everybody there. And then I had a great time at Cal Slotta at the dinner. They did a sort of impromptu fashion show where all the dinner guests walked and it was awesome. It was really, really fun. They had Momofuku, Cater it, and I was super hungry. So it was great. I had a good time. New York Fashion Week is as busy as ever, but I'm going to fewer shows than ever. And I think that just sort of speaks to where we are as an industry. But I look forward to chatting with you again on Friday. I'm going to go home to LA for a bit and then it's off to Milan. But let's get started with Leia. She is one of my oldest friends and one of my closest friends. And we've been in this industry together for a long time, so I hope you enjoy it. Leia Chernikov, welcome to Fashion People. Hi, Lauren. I'm so happy to be here. Usually on Tuesdays we ask what you bought this weekend. Did you buy anything? Yes. I bought a pair of Birkenstock clogs for my husband because it's his birthday today. Doesn't he have like 15 pairs of those already though? Actually, zero. Really? I know. And then I bought a blue button down at Kos to like hide the Birkenstocks when I came home. Okay. So two things. One is Leia's husband is a really good dresser and has his own taste. So that's why I'm just very surprised that he didn't have them. And two, there is the sweater at Kos. This is a Fashion Week gift. I was with an editor-in-chief walking out of the Tommy Show yesterday and she had on this gorgeous sweater that looked like that sweater from the row that Britt has, the navy, the really chunky one with the chunky. It's a thick collar, but it's a crew neck, but the collar is ribbed and thick. It was from Kos. And I almost texted you all. I think I saw it. Yeah, I almost texted you all at like 1am last night when I bought it because I was like, I have to get it. Because you know I'm not into duped culture, but this, it's, I actually prefer it. It doesn't have stitching down the back. And oh yeah, I do like that line down the back. I'd like the line down the back too, but honestly, it fit her so well and I'm just so glad I got it. So PSA to anyone. What color? I got black. It comes in black and gray. They do not have it in navy, which they really need to, but it's called like the chunky. And then they have a turtleneck version that is like the old Celine turtleneck. That was the best sweater that ever existed. I did not, I don't need any, anymore. But I do need a black sweater. I don't know if I saw it there. And then I saw actually that Ruthie Freedlander was also wearing this like kind of cropped, really expensive looking like zip up khaki kind of cotton jacket, but it was like a little bit bubble hand. It was also really chic and cost. Interesting. I wonder if they, they must have gotten a new designer. You think? Because they used to be really good when Rebecca Bay was there like over 10 years ago. I actually just saw her during Fashion Week because she's the creative director of Mary Mecko now and she did a one-shot Leila Gohar's place, which was super chic and delicious and fun. And we were catching up because after she went to cost, she was at Everlane and Gap and then Gap and then Everlane. Yeah. And then she went to Everlane and then now she's back in, in Denmark and is at Mary Mecko. But she was like the original cost person that made it really cool. And that we would, when we would go to Paris together and to Fashion Week, which was so fun, we would like buy a bunch of stuff from there. But it seems like something happened because the sweater, it's the pieces are trickling in. Yeah. Yeah. I was just going to say, we used to, before cost was here and it really did feel like special. And you were the one who first told me about it. And yes, Lauren and I used to share an Airbnb for many, many years going to Paris Fashion Week together. And we would always make cost a destination and then go to La, a falafel after. And that was like the journey. Shout out to Eric. I'm sure he, Eric Wasteo. What if he listened to this? We should cut out his last name probably. We're not cutting it out. No, we're not cutting it out. It was legal. A fantasy apartment. I loved it so much. Really? It was so fun. It was, it was, it was good time. So let's, let's fast forward to the present. How has your Fashion Week been? What have you seen that you've liked? Remember, this is going to record on Tuesday. So we're missing coach is tonight and Tory, but what have you seen so far that you thought was special? You know, a lot of good stuff. I feel like New York is doing New York really well. Yeah. And the weather has been sublime, which I think makes everything feel even better. 100%. Are you happy? You're always talking about the weather when you come from LA and how miserable it's going to be here. I could just talk about the weather all day long. That's why I like living in England because everyone just talks about the weather all the time. Isn't it the same? Yes, but they're always like complaining because it drizzled for five minutes. Right. I like gray weather. Okay. Well, so I, you know, I have a little baby, so I haven't been going to as many things, but I'm looking at all the things and I thought Proenza was lovely. And I thought Maria McManus, I still think what she does is really special. It's really small. And I love that she talks to everyone after just to tell them about where every piece comes from. And I think it makes it feel really intimate. And, you know, some lovely stuff at Kate, like that show at Tommy last night seemed just like incredible. Yeah, I'm so like, I cannot believe I missed Wu Tang on a ferry. It was crazy. It just has all been fun. And what I think is nice is like, it all, it's all like everyone doing like they're saying really well. Yeah, I 100% agree. I didn't go to Maria's show because I think I was recording a podcast at that time and couldn't switch it because it was with really fancy people. So I wasn't going to be like sorry, but in her show switch. But I just, I agree. I feel like Maria, what she does is very exactly your style. Like you could have just a whole wardrobe of her shirting. She's minimalist and she does a lot of shirting, but she's from Ireland. So it looks like a little bit sophisticated European. And there's a bit of prepiness to it. She worked at Tori for a long time. And I think she just wants to make nice clothes and do it in a responsible way. She knows that I am like not into hearing about the sustainability stuff, but she really means it. And I, huge fan. She does, she does. Huge fan. Yeah. It's a wardrobe and it's a, yes, it is totally my style. I like to see stuff that I think I would like to wear. Agreed. I have not gone to that many shows. I mentioned in the intro that the Todd Snyder show. Oh, did you hear about this? It was no. So the, the guys looked really good. I feel like Todd Snyder is where something's going on with that company, like in terms of positioning and he's making stuff that's like really elegant. Not that he, he always has, but it was like, she knows now it's, it's felt more someone DM me. It was like, it feels a little more dreese, like a little more limit. Like it doesn't look like it's no copying there, but just, just like more elegant man type situation where he could be sold in your very easily. So speaking of my style, my stylish husband, he gets like the catalog in the mail the other day. And he's just looking wistfully through it because he's like, man, I really want everything. Oh my God. Amazing. Yeah. He really is out of all of our friends, husbands, probably the most into clothes, like maybe even more than Dan. I think Nick is too. Oh, Nick is also, I guess they all are anyway. So it was at La Rock. Everybody was seated at these little tables. And you know, we've been at shows like this Gabrielle, her, she used to do this at Altropair DeSo where she'd do the show and everybody would be seated. This was mid afternoon. So it was like little cookies and things. It was very sweet. So I look up and the first model comes and he like really looks me in the eye. Like it made me deeply uncomfortable. And what I realized was they had instructed the models to like really stare into everybody's eyes. How did you react? I couldn't handle it. What did you do? You just looked away? Yes, I looked away. I stopped being in contact with them. I stopped looking at their faces. But some people were also uncomfortable. There were some people in the audience who were really into it. And like, I, it was too much for me. Yeah, it was very funny. A lot of connection. A lot of connection. It was too much connection for me. I don't know. I thought it was a very interesting thing. And I wonder if more people would will do it. But I really, I maybe I'll, you know, I'm gonna ask Todd why he did it. Because I didn't want to wait afterwards to do that because I had writing to do so I didn't want to wait. But like, it was weird. But interesting, but the clothes are good anyway. It just, and then later on that night after in the Tommy show was really fun. And, and then I went to Eckhaus and went to that dinner. And then there at least I was a little worried because they said everybody wear a piece of Eckhaus and I never do that. I'm always like, no, I don't do that. Like, I'm going to dinner on Monday night and they were like, can we send you something where I'm like, absolutely not. I would never do that. I'm sorry, I'll wear black. You won't don't take any photos of me. But I just don't like doing that. You know, it's just that it's not appropriate. It's not appropriate. Yeah, I know, I know. I did wear Eckhaus jeans because like, I don't know, they're a small brand. I have them. You have them, you like them. Whatever the Olsens once told me that they looked good and that they also own them. But I was really worried they were going to like push people to walk. But they didn't. It was just people who desired to do so. Like our friend Steph Yatka and Leanna Satinstein both walked. It was very cute. Yeah, I saw them on your Instagram. It was very charming. It was a fun party. But yeah, I agree. I think Alaya was in it's been a great week. You're right that the collections have been good. I didn't say Alaya just like the big, the big, the big, the big. It was I dedicated my whole like main story in Line Sheen on Monday to it because I just was like, this is he is now a bona fide superstar in fashion and he is leading the industry. He already was like, but it is Alaya is it now. That is it. The only note I wrote the whole time. Oh, 1000%. The only note I wrote was Alaya is my entire personality now. Well, I almost, you know, I didn't mention it because to me it feels like a separate world like from New York Fashion Week because there is something and I think it's it's not in a in a bad way. But like what that brand does and the resources that they have, it's very it's just a different it's a whole different universe. So I feel like totally all the like in New York Fashion Week feels like it's felt really fun and everyone doing kind of really outstanding collections. But that felt like, yeah, that was like also the marriage of venue and the designs just like astounding. Incredible for anyone who doesn't know and then we should move on to a different subject. So we're not talking for five hours. But it was at the Guggenheim and the Peter Mueller Mueller. How do you pronounce it? I thought you were going to know, but I should have known that you wouldn't know either. Of course, I don't know. You know, people DM me constantly being like, that's not how you say this. That's that's that's that's how you say I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, I think it's like Mueller. I don't know, whatever. He's been doing this sort of spiral endless, like a lot of the garments a couple of scenes ago, I believe they had like endless seams. And there was just like no and no beginning type things. So at some point, the Guggenheim reached out to them or they reached out to the Guggenheim. So this has been like several years in the making, I believe. And it just was when the first model came from the top, I was just like, damn, it's perfect. And I was sitting with our friend Becky Malinsky. And it was just so special to be able to see. I don't I don't like get emotional or about fashion shows pretty much ever. But that night, I was like, damn, this is a real thing. And and it's changing the industry. And that's a lot what I wrote about today. Yeah. This show is brought to you by Boca. Boca knows that when you take care of your mouth, your whole body benefits. That's why the Crete elevated oral care that fortifies your teeth. Boca's toothpaste uses a fluoride alternative called EnHa, a form of calcium that makes up the majority of your tooth enamel and dentin, which helps to remineralize enamel, fresh and breath, and white and teeth.

Make the switch to Boca for the whole family today at Boca.com. Another thing that could potentially change the industry, and I'm very curious, as someone who's like a little bit outside of this stuff, but is smart, we'll think about it. But did you know about this FTC's battle against tapestry? They want to block this merger with Right with Capri. with Capri, yes. And they actually start the court case started today, I believe. And the coach show, this is, we're talking Monday. So the coach show is this afternoon, Monday. So basically, for those of you who don't know, essentially what the FTC is trying to say is that by acquiring Capri, which owes Michael Kors, Jimmy Chu, and Versace, that tapestry, which owns Kate Spade, New York coach, and also Stuart Weissman, but they're trying to sell Stuart Weissman. They're going to become a handbag monopoly, and that they're going to start charging so much money for their handbags, which is never going to happen. And I read through a little bit of the pre, whatever the information that they send in, I don't have any, I've had even less sleep than I normally have, but all the legal documents that argument that tapestry is sent in. And it's just, I don't know, it seems absolutely absurd to me, but I'm curious to know, as someone who you are editing a magazine that covers every single part of the market and every single part of, you're looking at accessories, your team is bringing in everything that's available, and you're also watching the way consumers actually spend money. What do you make of all that? Well, it's true that this is like a little nitty gritty industry stuff for me. And I also, I did do some research and tried to look up to understand it because you gave me my bullets at midnight. At midnight. And I was asleep, but I had woken up and then, and then don't worry, when I woke up at three, I looked up Karen Elson's wedding. So, what, that's for another spiral. But this, I don't know, it does seem to me like a stretch to argue that there would be a handbag monopoly if these two brands merge because it's just not, there's so many choices and like the consumer expects to pay a certain price point for so many of these brands. Like I don't know, it just, it seems farfetched to me, but you know, Lena Kahn is a very formidable and fearless person. Yeah, I've talked about it with Pox, Eric, legal expert Eric Gardner a bit, and it sounds like there's a big chance tapestry will win. Whereas I think if there wasn't, he would have just been like, yeah, they're screwed. But it does sound like there's a chance they will win. So we'll see. I'm curious to see how it develops. I don't know how I'm going to keep track of that while all this stuff is happening. But the thing I look up that is that they say the FTC analysis misunderstands the handbag marketplace. So I don't know that that seems reasonable to me. Like, yeah, that they would not understand the way the handbag marketplace is set up and the way people shop. Yeah, they don't understand what accessible luxury is. They don't understand any of it. They don't know it so far as they're confused. Anyway, it's done. Moving on. Let's talk about the Karen Elson wedding. So she was wearing Alessandro McKaylee for Valentino, which I believe may be his first like public thing he's done. And she got married in New York. She looked great. I thought she looked real. And her daughter also looked beautiful. Oh, her daughter's dress was beautiful. And the two of them together looked so gorgeous. This was actually part two of the wedding. There was one part in Nashville where she's from, which explains all the Nashville connections, namely Taylor Swift and what she was there, I would think. So her that guy that Karen Elson married is the owner of Electric Lady Studios. So that's why this one. Yes, exactly. So does it but maybe you can explain this to me. Leigh Foster. Yes, Leigh Foster. So does Taylor, you, is that her producer or something? I couldn't, when I Googled it, I couldn't find like, I know she uses Electric Lady Studios, but like, do they produce her records or something? Do you even know it doesn't matter? Oh, no, I don't. I assumed like they were friends from Nashville. No, they have like a business relationship. Okay. Well, yeah, seems like a sheet crowd. Lana Del Rey too. Totally, totally. What do you think of, are you excited for Alessandro at Valentino? Yes, I am. I mean, I just think he is exciting to watch. Yeah. But speaking of, I'm just like eager to move on to our like biggest designer news of the day. Shall we go? Yeah, let's go. Sarah Burton, Givenchy, it happened. I wrote about it the first time I looked in November 2023. So it took, it took some time. It's you, you made it happen. Congratulations. I made this happen. Thank you, Sydney Tolodano for listening to me. What, what do you think? I think the industry is collectively pumped, but what, what's your, what's your take? Oh, I, yeah, I'm really excited. I mean, she's just so talented and elegant, and it just feels like a perfect pairing. And it's, I think a lot of people talk about how there are not enough women at major fashion houses right now. So that's exciting to see her get a major house. Although, you know, I think this has been a problem in the industry for a long time. So I always sort of bristle against the idea that this is like a new problem. But I also think it will be very exciting to see what she does with the, you know, the resources of couture. Totally. It'll be interesting. The thing that I had heard most recently from the yachts this summer was that I love the yacht dispatches. We're sitting on the yachts. LA has ruined you. It has really screwed me up, but that's, that's not for this podcast. I had heard that she was the reason that she hadn't signed. I heard she signed right around the time that Virginia fled Chanel. They, I heard that Sarah had signed. And then over the summer, there was like this rumor that she really wanted to do couture immediately, and they wanted to hold back. It was interesting in the language of the press release. It said men's and women's. So, and she's starting in March 2025. So she's definitely not going to do January couture, maybe July. But yeah, I think it's, it's perfect. I mean, it's such a, there's that symmetrical thing that Alexander McQueen, who everybody in the industry calls Lee, but I'm not going to do that and know him. And that's, I'm not going to be like that. But he started his career in Paris at Givenchy. So there is like a little symmetry there, which is interesting. I like that a lot. And I also think the thing that people don't understand, it's not that they don't understand, but they don't really look in depth of why there aren't a lot of women creative directors. But it really comes down to the fact that the hours that those companies are completely insane. And if you have a kid, I was, I'm good friends with a very senior level designer who's worked at a lot of these houses. Who's a woman. I don't want to say anything else because there are so few of them, it would give her away. But she was basically like, if you have a kid, you can't do this job. Because you're in, and in Europe, at least you get three weeks off in August or two weeks. But it's really intense hours and you are expected to be there from 10am to midnight. And yeah. And on top of that, it feels like almost anyone can barely do it. Like people, the churn is relentless because the expectations are so great. And like almost anyone seems set up for failure. So anyway, hopefully that's not the case. Yeah. And it's really interesting because if you think of the strong female creative directors, Sarah Burton, Claire Wakeheller, Phoebe Philo, they're all British, which is very interesting. Which one thing that that has allowed all three of them to do is if they work in Paris, they can still live in London and their kids can go to school in London if they want. Elise Trotter is another example. Is that Carve now? Carve? What does that mean? Carve? I don't know. Don't you speak French? Yeah, I guess you would say that. I sort of speak it. Enough. It doesn't matter. But she worked at La Cosse also. And so I think her family did live there. But the point being that it makes it a bit easier. Maria Grazia. Maria Grazia. And Maria Grazia goes back and forth from I guess Rome to Paris. Your kid is older too. Yeah. But a lot of them are British. I mean, I don't know if Claire Wakeheller went to St. Martin's Phoebe and I'm sure Sarah did also. But it is also that sort of St. Martin's at the height, Louise Wilson, all that stuff. But it's interesting. Yeah, it is just and I think what these houses have realized in the last two years because business isn't as good as it used to be is that creativity matters, making pretty things that are not just like you're just not churning out, product matters. And I do feel a shift. I don't know if it's a seismic shift, but the winds are blowing a different way. Well, we have Shemena. Oh, yeah. And also we did not say Mrs. Prada. Oh, yeah, of course. She's the ultimate. And so I think it's positive change. But it is really, really about what it was that were it's really systemic. It really is like it starts with who is getting hired as an intern because these people hire their friends, their friends usually look like them, it has to start at the bottom. So all these talent programs that LVM Asian Caring are doing, that's where they're going to make the changes and make a difference. So to that point, like that was like kind of a pretty notable thing to see at the end of the Chloe show, Shemena Kamali's debut, like to have her young kid, which are the toughest years to be balancing motherhood and work. And I like to have her, you know, him run up and her give her a hug. Like that was like, not only just a sweet moment, but like, but maybe that is a sign of like, okay, is this like, hopefully this will be feasible? Yeah, I hope so. And also, I just think the more variety always, the better. Yes. And the more good stuff that that comes out of it. So it's really exciting. Congratulations, Sarah. I would just like to say for the record that she was at Vogue World. And I don't know her, but I know that she is not a person that would go to Vogue World unless she had to for work. Someone was like, Oh, she would just go for Anna. And I was like, no, she she got a job. Anyway.

So the final thing is there was this the news. I don't remember what day it was, but that Glenn, I think Friday that Glenn Martin's was leaving or maybe it was sad. I don't remember. Why project? Why project? Stepping out. Look, and so immediately I get like many messages from your Argella. So Glenn Martin's is also created director of diesel, which is owned by OTB, which is also Margella. Yeah. And there have been rumors for months that John Galliano's leaving Margella and going back to Alvayam H in some capacity, probably to his own brand. We don't know if any of that's true. These are just this just speculation. But Glenn Martin's is Belgian. Martin Margella is Belgian. He's extraordinarily talented designer. It's going to be really hard for Renzo Rosso who owns OTB, even though he has an amazing group and like let's creative people be creative. Hold on to Glenn Martin's given like the bigger groups will probably pay him a gazillion dollars just because he's so good just to grab his talent. But the other big thing and then I'll let you talk, but the other big thing is that Y project, the co-founder who ran the business. So Glenn Martin didn't many people think he founded Y project, but they actually did. And it was this other guy in I think 2009 or 10 and Glenn was his intern. And then that guy three years later died. And so then Glenn became the creative director in 2013. But like people think of it. Yeah. And then and then the other co-founder just died last year. It's really sad. And so the one thing I would say is like Diesel is a really big job. And so maybe he just is stepping down because I know that they were trying, there's been reports that they were trying to find money. Like there's just so many things. Is he stepping down from diesel too? No, no, no. No, he's still there. So I think there is a big chance he's going to Margella. But like also he might just be staying at diesel. I'm just curious like what do you think of him? Where would you like to see him go? Oh, I know this was by the way, readers sent to me with a missive you have to answer this question, which I feel was. Did I do that? Yes. I'm sorry. I was just trying to, well, how did I say it? I just was trying to get you to say readers, listeners. Oh, well, you were like, you don't have to answer this part. This part you have to answer. Oh, yeah, you don't have to answer the, you don't have to speculate about the gossip. That's my job. But what I would like you to say is what you like, who what your dream scenario for him would be. Oh, well, that seems to me just as dangerous. It's like, do you want to plead the fifth? Maybe, but I mean, who like who cares what I, you know, what I say, but I think he's super talented. Like, I remember buying diesel jeans in 2001, when I studied abroad and then did not think about them for like, you know, almost two decades. And then all of a sudden it was like, so cool. And that's all because of him. He's clearly super talented. And it would be very cool to see what he would do with a big house. And I, yeah, I just don't, don't know. I looked at the Twitter's, it seems like a lot of people are saying Margella, but then wasn't, wasn't there, weren't there also rumors about Galliano and Givenchy and where is he going? And anyway, and he just did that show that everyone lost their minds over. So anyway, this is, this is your business. That was before the rumor started. My hunch is that Galliano is going back to John Galliano. And that, so there's also this one with Martina or Martine, he used to work at, sorry, I cannot pronounce her last name. I really need to get better at this stuff. People are going to start being annoyed with me. But who you, who was Demna's deputy at Balenciaga for years. And she, and the stylist that she worked with a lot have been like around Margella. And people were like, she's getting the job. But maybe she went to work there with Glenn. I don't know. I have no idea. All I do know is that Glenn is extremely talented and people like, Oh, TB needs to hold on to him for dear life. Cause he is, and I think he's done an incredible job with diesel and I'm a big fan. That's all I really know. But you know what? I might know more soon. And if I do, I will obviously share with you. Did you know he is almost exactly our age? Yeah. Well, you want to hear a really hilarious story. And then we should go. Of course. So I met with him for coffee when they were here for the Mac Galla. And we met at the Plaza Hotel, which have you been there in recent years? No, I have no reason to be there. It's very funny. It's like an Instagram thing. Like you go there if you're 12 to take photos. Yeah, very funny. But we had a very nice coffee. I love Eloise. Okay. Yeah, it's very, yeah, it's Eloise coated. So we went there for, um, I guess it's not, I guess it's not Eloise coated. It's just Eloise. But we went there for coffee. We have coffee and he's talking about all the young employees. And he says something where he says, Oh, we call them, I thought he said we called them the wide legs. The wide legs? Yeah. Because like everybody that age wears wide leg jeans. So and like, you know, looks like they're ravers or whatever. So I put this very casually in some piece I wrote. And I get an email from the PR and that was like, Glenn really enjoyed speaking with you, by the way, he didn't say wide legs. He was referring to some crap on Game of Thrones about wildlings. Do you know what this is? Or like wildlings or yeah, you know, what is it called? It's different. Whatever. I think it's the, hold on, wildlings. So I was deeply embarrassed. Like I, that's not something I would fact check. Like I do fact check stuff, people, but not that. And I was just like, Oh my God. So I had to put a correction in about it. But it was funny because I was like, if I'd seen it, I would have made fun of you about that. It's kind of the same sentiment. Like just like crazy young people. Do you, did you watch Game of Thrones? No, I don't, I don't engage with stuff like that. I can't imagine that. I don't have time for that. I will do some, actually, no, I just like, I have no interest. I have no interest. It's good. It was fun. I have two things for you. What? Tell me. Well, I wanted to ask one thing that I really like about going to Fashion Week is seeing what people are wearing because I do think at the shows in Europe, there's much more of like the brands pay the people to wear the clothes and that and the sense of what you get of people are wearing is it's a very, it's just not like authentic in that way. Like everyone looks great in those clothes, but they're wearing heads to toe looks. And I love like being out and getting to see just like what people are putting together. And that's really inspiring to me. So I wanted to ask what you thought of what people are wearing that you're liking a lot. I have seen a ton of Alaya, which is fun. And I think like I, as we both do, we look at what people are wearing in the market to kind of inform what we write and talk about. I love that cost sweater that the editor in chief was wearing. I feel like everybody's wearing sandals, which is kind of a lame thing to say, but it is fall and there was a shoe. Oh, I'm very into the boat shoe thing and the ballet boat shoe, Becky Malinsky. Do you have them yet? I don't think they're right for me. Okay. I don't wear loafers. I can't wear like a shoe that looks masculine. It doesn't look right because I wear very masculine clothing. Yeah. So you need a balance. I need a balance. So I like tend to wear a more delicate shoe. I don't know if it's just for me, but you know, I love preppy, but like I'm not preppy. It feels a little too on the nose if you're to go for it. Yeah. Yeah. But I'm very into that shoe. I'm trying to think of what else I've just noticed everybody. What I have noticed is that, and I bought a black leather jacket the other day that I saw it while Garcon, I had been looking at it online. I tried it on a little Garcon because I'm staying near there and I bought it. I was just, it's the best thing, but it is very, it feels like that Phoebe Filo peplum leather jacket, I think has really, it's interesting because Phoebe Filo's launch was complicated and it was hard to see is it going to actually be influential, but I've really felt it this season and I rolled up yesterday in like all black and that jacket and I felt like it was a little much for me. It wasn't my, I wasn't in my comfort zone because I was wearing those black eccles jeans and like it was just a little too, it wasn't like totally my style all put all together, but I think that that Phoebe collection, also seeing the younger designers collections, I went to this new thing called literary sport at the top of fashion week, which is like ready to wear, but made with technical fabrics and all the color palette and then the tennis line spence is all very, definitely like subconsciously coming from the Phoebe influence and so, and also the, I think, Alaya too, like you can see the influence in the silhouettes and things from Alaya, but that's the thing that has been the most interesting to me that everybody is like looking a little more tough and that we just got out of this really and I think it had to do with the pandemic and wanting to feel grounded or something this really traditional dressing like me wearing Charvet shirts with plaid jackets and things like that and I will still do that, especially in LA, but there's something like a little tougher happening right now and I think that is hugely and sexier like tighter clothes. It's not like you're trying to be sexy, you just like want to look good and so that I think is something that is really changing. What about you? Yeah, well, so I, as you know, my, my boss, our editor in chief at Harper's Bazaar, Samir and Aster and she is to me always a good like bellwether of where everybody's going to go in like a year or so. She's been wearing Alaya like out the gate so that I could see coming and then and she just like she wears it so well and so I knew, no, I could tell that like this was just going to have like a total like ripple effect and Phoebe too, but yeah, like I, I'm just inspired by seeing people like moving around and I agree like sandals and flat shoes, but I do, I've been feeling like I want a bit of a heel again and I'm sort of curious. I'm trying to figure out how to go about that because I need to be able to walk a lot. Yeah, I have a pair from Saint Laurent that Saint Laurent Saint Laurent. Just messing with you. Your friend Jackson is beautiful. Thank you. I have a pair that I got in Europe so they and with the VAT like they were actually pretty affordable for designer and they're just like I'd say they're two and a half inch. They're perfect because I can walk in them really easy. I do have a pair of four inch from the row that I can wear. You do? Yeah, I wore them to Ralph Lauren the other night. Four? Wow. Okay. And I can wear them, I could walk to and from the car in them and in LA I can wear them easily. It's fine. Like I wear them at events all the time and I'm going to wear them. I'm filming something tomorrow and I'm going to wear them for that, but yeah, it's like, you know, I could, I never could walk in heels as we both know. Yeah, to me two and a half feels like the limit. Yeah, yes, I know you in heels. Yeah, let's not talk about that. Okay, the last thing I wanted to say is I'm trying to follow in your footsteps and we are doing our own pod. So I wanted to be able to talk about it on another pod. So anyway, tell me about it. So Lynette Nylander, who's our executive digital director and I are launching a podcast for Harper's Bazaar. It's called the Goodbye B-U-Y and the premise is essentially that we will, it's an interview show and the idea is that you'll get to know the world's most stylish people through their closets and shopping carts. It's just sort of like deep diving with people about how their clothes tell their stories, like what's in their shopping carts, how they shop and how they develop their taste and it's really fun. My God, I love it so much. Can I come on in like a year and a half after you get all the fancy people out of the way? Yes, please. Oh, because you are a shopper. Like you, you know the people who like care a lot and think deeply about it. So like I, and I got in, I'll just say, let's tease her. Tracy Alasarosa is our first guest and I got her to open up her Amazon subscribe and save, which Lynette said I was very too excited about, but I just was and I really wanted to, I was like, I want to know like the giant Loewe bag, someone is tracking down what she was and got it, the giant Paseo and then, but then I also want to know like, yeah, what's on your subscribe and save? I love it. I cannot wait. She looked great at that Loewe dinner this past weekend. I cannot wait for this. There are not enough fashion podcasts. There needs to be more and also you're, you're a great interviewer and huge fan of Lynette, potentially the coolest girl who works in fashion. The most fun, absolutely. I mean, Samira is probably the coolest, but Lynette might be the second coolest. So that's true. It's a very cool team. And I have like, this is, these are the kind of notes she leaves me on my desk. I can't see what it says, but I'm sure it's funny. You are a slut. Oh, amazing. While I'm in a meeting. Perfect. Perfect. So when it comes out, let me know. So everybody look out for it, but I'll also promo it in the newsletter, obviously. Cheat. Thank you. You should come back on. I would love to. This is very fun. It was so fun. I'm thrilled. Thank you for being here, Lea. Thanks for having me, Lauren. We'll talk soon. Okay, I'll see you later. Bye. Bye.
