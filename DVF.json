Hi everyone, happy Friday. I am back in Los Angeles for one day. Then off to New York for a week of Halloween fun. I know I sound crazy. I'm not going to get on a plane for a couple months after this or, you know, maybe a month. I'm not that crazy. I'm crazy in other ways, but the travel stuff, it's fine. This week I was in Chicago for more book promotion. We had a great time. I did do a little bit of channel checks. I went to Notra in the West Loop. I guess that's how you pronounce it. It's a great shop. I guess it's very Gorp core oriented. You walk in and the set, I'm sure this isn't permanent, but there's like, you walk in, it's set up like you're walking into a forest and there's a cabin. And you sort of walk through the woods to get to the sneakers and the clothes. It's clever. I liked it. I didn't get to go to sovereign, which is I guess the other like young cool store, but I did go to another store that's young and cool, but also for everyone. It's kind of like a mini Barney's or a mini department store. I loved it. It's called space 519 and these guys, Jim and Lance, who used to have this store called Jake a long time ago that I shopped out in like the aughts, like the first round of what's that, Indie Sleaze. I was shopping at Jake and Hedge Spina in Bucktown, but Jim and Lance owned Jake in, I think about 10 years ago or probably longer than that, they opened space 519 and there's a restaurant, there's a beauty section, there's home, there's tons of beautiful jewelry, there's great clothes, they have a really great mix of brands. And yeah, it was just so nice. They had a cocktail party for us and I guess at the restaurant, it's like every single sitting is totally booked. It's the place to hang if you live on the Gold Coast or in the Gold Coast or, well, I don't know how you say that, but it was really nice. They were so fab and we signed a ton of books. I think we signed like a hundred books or something. So thank you all who came out to that and our other books, Signing and our Soho House Talk and all that stuff and big thanks again to Travis and Sam who were really amazing. I also ate a lot of really good food. This week on Line Sheet, you know what's crazy? All the stuff that we had on Line Sheet this week. So on Monday, we were in Italy with the Gucci moves and the YNAP rumors. On Wednesday, we came back to Brentwood with Gwyneth Paltrow and Goop, which is once again, they had some layoffs earlier this fall and Rachel Sturgaerts really got into the restructuring and what they're doing. And you know, as Gwyneth would say, we wish her the best. I love Goop Kitchen. It's so delicious. Then on Thursday, we were back in New York virtually, obviously. I was actually in Chicago, but via Columbus, Ohio, because as I'm sure you've heard, former CEO of Abercrombie and Fitch, the really famous one, Mike Jeffries, was arrested for sex trafficking on Tuesday. And so I wasn't going to just like do a report of that because it's fine. And as this stuff trickles out, I'll keep you all updated. But I wanted to talk about Mike Jeffries as a leader and what he did with Abercrombie and Fitch and how he accomplished that because I think it speaks to how he ended up in this situation. I also went into his sort of relationship with Les Wexner. They had a big rivalry and he worked for Les Wexner who used to own Abercrombie and Fitch. And then Wexner spun it off in I think 96 and then a year later, in 96 or 97, a year later, he divested fully even though the business was on the rise and he would have made way more money if he had stayed in. So it was an interesting thing. We get a little bit into it in the book and I just talked about the two of them and how they lived their lives and how their personal lives affected or at least connected to their work lives. So there was no love loss there as you would say. I'll say that. So definitely check that out. And next week, I'm going to write about this tapestry situation. Not sure if you heard, but the FTC blocked the merger between tapestry and Capri. Tapestry owns coach, Capri owns Michael Kors. Friend of mine who's an economist sent me a very sensible explanation of how it happened and why it made sense legally that it was blocked. And it makes sense. I understand. But one of the arguments they're making. So one thing that wasn't great was that I guess in meetings, I don't know which executives I need to look at all the documents said that, oh, well, coach is priced higher than course. We can definitely get coach up to course prices. And what the FTC kind of took that as is price gouging or just like eliminating competition. Whereas maybe this is just me being drinking the marketing Kool-Aid, but it's more about like, yeah, Michael Kors stuff is too cheap. It should be more expensive. It's like, it's not the price value equation. And it needs to be more expensive so that they can make some profit. Because right now they don't make a lot of profit on their stuff because it's heavily discounted. The other thing that this guy said in this document in this newsletter was that it was bizarre that the company was talking about how like a conglomerate, like brands within a conglomerate would compete against each other. Of course they wouldn't compete. Of course it would be value-driven. And it's like, you don't understand how fashion works. Because that's like the whole thing is they're just competing against each other and fighting for space. And though, you know, it's just interesting, but I think I'll try to get into that. I'm going to talk to some people on Friday, which is today when you're listening to this. I'm going to talk to some people today and then over the weekend. And hopefully I'll have some interesting information for you. I think right now at Capri and Tapestry, there's a lot of shock. I'm sure there are some people who are expecting it to happen. But yeah, it's very interesting. So definitely check that out and I will have more on Monday. I hope you enjoy this conversation with Diane. It's very funny. I mean, I've interviewed her many, many times. And I just really like her. She's a fun person to talk to. She likes talking to the press. She's happy to chat with the press. She doesn't totally dodge questions. She doesn't always answer them in the way you would love someone to. But she's, I'd say, more honest than most people. And that's a huge reason why she's been so successful. And the thing that she talks about in our conversation that I think is important for people who work in fashion or if you're a designer or whatever is this idea of legacy and succession. And we talk about it so much, but we see all these designers who are in their 90s or in their 80s who they don't have a succession plan in place. Or if they do, it's managed very privately. And I don't know. I think it's important to think about what's going to happen after you go and we get pretty, we don't get deep, but we talk about some deep stuff. So I hope you have fun. If you want to talk about tapestry and capri, if you work there, let me know. And I would love to speak with you. And we'll talk next week. If you're going to the CFDAs, say hi. I can't wait to see you. Diane von Furstenberg, welcome to Fashion People. Hi, how are you? I'm very well. How are you doing? I am good. I was up at four this morning and I feel like I've had a full day. I love to wake up early because I love to watch the sun go up. There's a magical moment when the day starts. And so I'm good. I'm good. I am very busy because I'm an interesting moment of my life where I have started what I call operation legacy. And because of my age, I'm 77 years old. So it's time to do the inventory of all of the things that I have learned, the experiences, the archive, this and that, and trying to put everything in order and everything in part, the appropriate parts, so that hopefully I can leave something behind me as I enter the window of my life that is inspiring and will help other people. Do you think that there's something about the fact that you're a woman that you've decided to do it this way? So if you look at like Mewchaprada or Donatella Versace, succession and legacy are things that a lot of women have in fashion have faced head on. Whereas as we know, there are many men who never face it and then it's dealt with. But I think as a rule, women deal with immortality much better. I mean, with mortality instead, much better. I mean, for me, maybe one of the things probably that explains very much the essence of who I am. And this is not something that I realized as I was growing up. But now that I look back, I realize that what really explains the person that I am is my birth. Because my birth was a total miracle. 11 months, no, so to say, 15 months before my mother, before I was born, my mother was liberated from concentration camp and she weighed 49 pounds. She was just a bunch of bones into the ashes. She wasn't supposed to survive, but she did. Her parents, when she went back to Belgium, her parents could not believe that she was alive. Her mother fed her a little bit like a little bird so that she wouldn't explode or die. And within six months, she was normal. I mean, she was always tiny, but she was normal. At that time, her fiancee came back from Switzerland where he had been and they got married. And the doctor told them, you absolutely have to wait three years to have a child because you won't make it, you will die and your child will not be normal. And sure enough, they married in November. I was born the following December and in a sense, I was not normal. But anyway, my mother didn't die and I was born. So in a weird way, just the fact of being born was a triumph over misery. It made me and because my mother taught me two lessons, no matter what, never be a victim. And the other lesson is fear is not an option. Okay? So these two lessons is what she taught me. And she always made me very independent and she pushed me ahead. She never said, be careful. She always said, take your responsibility. And she used to say, God save me so that I can give you life. By giving you life, you gave me my life back. You are my torch of freedom. So it could be in a sense a little happy for a little girl to have a torch of freedom in her hand. But now I think that's the best gift she gave me. So that explains very much the kind of person that I am. You know, I just go for it and I own it. And more important, I honor life. And if you honor life, you cannot not think about death. Because thinking about death gives value, so much more value to life. And is that part of the reason you agreed to do that documentary with Fabiola? We had her on when she launched in. No, but the documentary was different. Fabiola, who I knew her father, you know, I knew her father when I was a teenager. I, he shared bedroom boarding school with Agon for four years. So I know Fabiola's family forever. She always wanted to do a documentary about me and I always, I was not interested. I met Charmine, the director, the Pakistani director, because I gave her the word for glamour of the world. So we became friends. And with Charmine, I wanted to do a series of short docs about the women that I have, the women of vital verses, the women that I give awards to on the DPR award. And we tried to shop it and no network was interested. And they kept on saying to Charmine, why don't you make a documentary about me? And I say, I don't really want to do that. And then Charmine said, you know, through you, we can talk about the women. So I got Charmine together with Fabiola and this name bothered, Oulu in America, this name for the rest of the world. And at that point, I said, then I cannot be a producer. I cannot be involved. I trust you guys. You have my archives. You have the contract of my friends. I will tell them that they can talk to you and you're on. And they did it. And this exhibition at Skirball, which is an incredible... The exhibition is very funny because three years ago, three years when COVID came, I had a kind of a moment of... I said, when COVID came, my business was losing money because I had had the wrong management who spanned and opened too many stores, too many outlets and everything. When COVID came, I said, oh, this is a moment to stop. And I do. And at that point, I gave the operation of the business. I closed all the stores. I paid all the people. I did everything that I write. And I gave the operation of the business to my Chinese distributor because they were my largest clients because they had 59 stores in China. Okay. At that time, I thought, I am going to take the inventory of everything that I have. But now I forgot what was the question. Well, it was about the Skirball exhibition and how it connects your legs. Oh, yes. At that time, two things happened. I get a call from Belgium, the Museum of Fashion. There's a small museum in Brussels who used to be the Museum of Lace because Lace has a long tradition in Belgium. A few years ago, they turned it into the Museum of Fashion and Lace. And usually they would take curators from the outside to curate special exhibitions. This time, two years ago, they decided to hire their own full-time curator. They hired this very fashionista young person who had worked at Chanel's in the archive and had a deal in the exhibition. He was hired and he decided that he wanted for his first exhibition to do me. So when they called me, I said, how old are you? And he said 29. I said, you're 29. You got this museum. And your first exhibition is me with all of the great avant-garde designers you can find in Belgium. And he said, yes. I said, but why? And he said, because what you stand for is very relevant to my generation for now. So of course, if you are known the woman and you're being told that by a young guy at a moment that you're in crisis with your business, your identity and everything, it feels really good. So I said, OK, if the museum sends you to New York, you can stay with me. And I will take you to Connecticut and we will go through the archives. And I liked him and he did this exhibition called Woman Before Fashion. Because I liked him, I introduced him to Vitzoni and I arranged for him to do a book of which, again, I'm only the subject, the exhibition and the book. I am the subject, but I was not the writer, which is a wonderful way to be, especially at the time that I was reflective about me. Because to hear it and the same thing happened with the movie, that also. I was able to look at the body of my work and my life through the lens of someone else. So it's not a marketing effort. It's not my point of view. It's my life and my work and whoever. It's me, but it's seen from somebody else. And so and then a few, I don't know, six months ago, eight months ago. So it lasted one year in Belgium. And then the Skirball contacted the Museum of Brussels and asked, they said, we would like to have it on. So they are the one who brought it. And Nicola, the curator, called me and said, you know, they want to do it in LA. And that's how it happened. And what would you say when you look at your legacy and you seem like a very self-reflective and introspective person, what do you think that your legacy is and how does this particular show display that? Well, that's the, did you see it? No, you didn't see it. I haven't seen it yet. I will live in LA now. So I'll be able to go, but I wasn't in town when you all did the event. Okay. You should say it's very nice. It's very, very nice. It's, let's see, well, it's first of all the timeline and then you have the wrap dress. And I mean, the wrap dress by itself is a phenomenon. I mean, you know, that's why there's a court of me on the wall that said, I created the wrap dress. Or is it the wrap dress that created me? You know, because through the wrap dress, I found my independence and you see a wrap dress through the decade, the 70s, the 80s, the 90s, 2000 and 2010. So it's pretty amazing. That's pretty amazing. And then, you know, the influence of the kimono and the toga and then it's with art, all the dresses with art. And then after the inspiration of nature, because the two things that inspire me is nature and women. And then, of course, women before fashion. So he had a lot of women designer from Chanel to Vionette to Donna Karen, I think, a few more. Just showing that women, which is something that Cristiana Cuato me years ago, men designer make costume, women designer make clothes because women designer wear the clothes. That's why women like jersey. I mean, if you have to choose fabric, you know, if you don't wear it, you will be much more attracted to a satin du chef or something like that than a jersey. But if you wear them, you know the value of jersey because. And then after that is liberty. And then they have, because it's a Jewish center, they have my mother on the little corner, the two notes that she had left behind. And she speaks the poor thing. She's on a loop. Which is the only thing that really bothers me because she's speaking on a loop and I just feel she will be so dying. And after that, so there's a liberty and liberty because I was the godmother of the statue of liberty. And next to my mother, who told me that I was the torch of freedom. And then after that, oh, La Petite Valley is the little suitcase, because I always had my best, always had my best designing ideas when I'm packing. And if you know how to pack, you know how to live. If you pack like you, you live lightly. So I'm a great packer. And I always have less luggage than anyone else. I also, because my clothes are very tiny, tiny and they fold very well. After La Petite Valley, what's after that? A woman in the clothes, is that it? So all the, you know, the queens and the celebrities in the dresses, I think there's something else. And then the Philandropole. It's very well done actually. Question for you. You have always engaged with the press. As long as I have been a reporter, you've always been very accessible to people like me, no matter where I worked. You're very open and comfortable, I think because you know yourself so well. This past year, this is happening at Skirball. It talks about you're a child of a Holocaust survivor, like very deeply connected to your being Jewish. How have you communicated in the past year with the war? And I know that you don't shy away from that kind of stuff, but like it's so difficult. No, I hate wars. I have to tell you I hate wars. And I think I'd rather be killed than killing. Having said that, October 7 was a horror. I became very good friend with the mother of a hostage actually when I was in Davos, but she's great and she's brave and she has dignity and she's not a victim. I am totally 100% Jewish, but I'm not religious. And maybe because my mother was a Holocaust survivor, I feel like I have more freedom to even criticize. So I'm very much like that. I mean, I didn't choose it to go to the Skirball, but I think it's very nice that it did. And I mean, when the Holocaust Museum in DC was created, I was one of the founders. So I am absolutely, I didn't know that. You have to understand, I married the German aristocrat. I became a German princess. Nobody knew I was Jewish. My children were, you know, I did not, I don't practice religion. My children, no, no, no. And then when I was 30 or 31, ADL, Anti-Defamation League honored me and I didn't want to go. And then finally I went there and I listened to what it was about. And when I was on stage, I was what 31, 32 years old. When I got to stage to get me at my award, I heard myself say something that not only I had never said, but I had never thought, which is you all know me because my dress, but what you don't know is that 30 months before I was born, my mother was an archer. And I was shocked and I don't let myself be emotional at all. But I thought in that moment, I realized that actually it was important for me, because people didn't expect it, it was important for me to say it. Why do you think it's important? Why do you think it's important to talk about? I am Jewish. I am not Jewish. I know it's everybody's big surprise, but why do you think it's important to talk about and also just generally engage with press more broadly? Because if I call you, you call me back and not everyone is like that and curious why you think- I know who you are. I know who you are. I like you. You know, you have a, you know, you're a little bit provocative, which I like. My relationship with the press started really early, early on. I was in my early 20s when it started. And I remember I used to travel all around and meet the press. And then, I mean, I don't really read the articles, but then I realized that their perception of me was a Park Avenue princess. And I didn't like that. So from that moment on, I was quite outspoken, sometimes provocative, because at least it was my narrative. I mean, then you realize you have a voice. So if you have a voice, you may as well use your voice to be inspired, to inspire. You know, I mean, if you're lucky to have a voice, it's not just about selling yourself. You know, it's making a point of what you're trying to do. And I was always a feminist, very neon neon. And I was making a dress that was making women feel good and sexy and this and that. So there was, I don't know, she's turned out that, you know, the other day I was so tired. All I do is talk about myself over and over and over. And I called my daughter and I said to her, because she's the one who is the strictest with me. I said, what kind of destiny is it to talk about myself all the time? And she had a wonderful answer, which made me feel so good. She said, you know what? Probably your destiny is to be a conduit. And I like that. Well, I think that you. Did you see the documentary? Yes. Yes. Did you like it? Yes, I did. I think that you are a person who and I also really like Fabiola and think that the director, you know, I think that. Two directors. I had two directors because once we started, my director, Shamil, got hired to do Star Wars. So she had to hire another director and then there was a strike. So she didn't get involved with Star Wars. So I ended up two directors. I think the thing that I admire about you and a lot of women and a lot of your, your customers admire is that people are given a lot in life and some people use it for good or to be productive and some people don't. And you have faced a lot of challenges, but you've also been given a lot of gifts and abundance and you have. Used it in a way that is admirable and inspiring to a lot of people. And I think the way you talk about your business is also inspiring to people because again, you've been very open about your business. You're talking about everything you were going through, through the pandemic, but when you look at all the iterations, iterations of your company before we started rolling, you said you've never had like a true investor. You've had partners that have worked on. So, so how did you, because there were many times when your business changed or you, or you stopped for a while and you started to go through it. Yeah. Okay. All right. So I started, I was what, 23 years old? I mean, I was really young and the reason I started is because I had worked, not even work, I interned at a printing mill in Italy. This guy was making, it was making a print, right? So he used to print. So I learned everything about printing, you know, all the different and how to make a color palette and this and so on. He also had a knitting factory where he invented this Jersey fabric at the time that I was there. So we have this Jersey fabric. Oh, we should print on that. Oh, we should make a little t-shirt and a polo shirt. Oh, the polo shirts could be a polo dress. I was there at that time, you know, when, and so, and I, and no idea that this unglamorous door to work in that factory was going to be my door. It's my birthday. My mother gives me for my, for my birthday a ticket to go to New York to visit my boyfriend, Agon, who I had met at university and who was doing an internship in a bank in New York. I go to New York in 1969. New York is incredible, right? It is dirty. It is dangerous, but it is cheap. And because it is cheap, you have all the artists and, and it's the, you know, you have Warhol and Westerman and Rauschenberg and Jasper Jones. Everyone is there. There's nudity on Broadway. There's all this crazy hair, all these things are happening. And I just couldn't believe, oh my God, where I had landed. So as the girl friend of this very eligible, eligible prince, you know, they all were like the girls in really Magna, but they pretended and they were all these young designers that would invite me to the showroom and give me clothes. Halston, Georgia, St. Angelo, Stephen Boroughs. Okay. So, and those also were clothes so different than anything that was in Europe. So after a month that I'm in New York, I have to go back. I go back and in the plane, I'm thinking, all I'm thinking about is how do I go back to New York? When I arrived in Italy and I see the factory, all of a sudden I had a major breakthrough. This is my opportunity. I am going to make little samples of little dresses and I'm going to try to sell them in America. And I started and I worked with a pattern maker and this and that. I would pick any fabric that wasn't being used. And I started it. Aegon is in May. It comes to Rome on the way because he finished his internship and he had a job in September. So he had the whole summer up. So he's going with a friend of his to go to a trip to Asia. And after that, he was going to spend the holiday in Sardinia. He says, meet me in Rome. I meet him in Rome. We meet in Rome. And he takes me shopping. He buys me a beautiful jumpsuit and he said, tonight I've organized the dinner with all our friends, blah, blah, blah, and this restaurant. And he gives me a ring, a ring that he has designed. And yes, vaguely we talk one day, we should really get married. But it's all very vague. So you could say it was an engagement, but you also say it's not an engagement. Nevertheless, that night, I must say before he left and I spent the night with him, I did say to him, tonight I will make you a son. Okay. But it was very much of a neurotic thing. It wasn't something that I really meant. He goes on his trip. I go back to it. I go back to the factory. The man who owned the factory, he has a Lamborghini and you know how Italians drive. And we go from factory, from factory in his car and he drives like a maniac. He drops me in Milan and in the middle of Vesta Sambabela, I faint. Everybody thought I was dead and they said, I'm dead. I'm dead. I said, no, I move. I say, I'm not dead. I was not dead, but I was pregnant. Okay. So. So you did make him a son? I did. I did. I did. And I didn't used to tell that story, but now I did. And not only I made him a son, I made him a good son, a great son. Anyway, so to make the story short, I mean, I go, I mean, I didn't want to get married pregnant. I thought everybody would think I did the non-professionals. So I offered all the suggestions and he sends me a telegram. Absolutely not organized wedding, July 15, Paris. I said, really? So anyway, so we got my, so I went to the man who owned the background and I said, listen, I am pregnant. I'm getting married and I'm moving to America, but I absolutely need to be independent. So please, will you allow me to make samples and give me good terms? Okay. So he said, absolutely. And this man is one of the most important person in my life because he allowed me to do this and to make samples and I would pay him after I got paid and whatever. And so in a sense, I was financed by him only because I had good terms, which is why I've always told designers, I said, don't take money for just money. Take, go to the manufacturer, go to the people who make the clothes because those are the people who are the most interested for you to be successful. So that's, I'm telling you that because for the people that listen to that, they will remember. Okay. So that was my first. So I can go through the whole thing. If you, anyone is interested, they can read, listen or read my book, The Woman I Wanted to Be, I tell everything. Then it became a huge, I'm trying to make it short, a new success overnight. I mean, you know, within two or three years, I was making 25,000 wrap dresses a week. I mean, it was insane. And then of course, because my salesman didn't want to diversify, the manufacturer didn't want to diversify. I knew there were too many wrap dresses around. Every woman in America had one, two, 10, 20. And so the first hurdle is that all of a sudden one day, everybody marked down the dresses. And so there was the saturation, but at the same time that there was the saturation, I also need the security 24 seven on my, in the warehouse, because they were so much in demand in the street, you know. So that time, I licensed my dress business to Puritan fashion, who is Andrew Rosen's father, who at the time had Calvin Time jeans. So it was a big thing. He had Calvin Time jeans and DVF dresses. And that time I started a cosmetic company. So my dress business was a license. Then I built this huge cosmetic company. Then again, when it was built, I am a manifesto. I know how to manifest things. I know how to build things. I don't think I am a good CEO for sure, but I am a chief manifesto. So, and then so that went to that. And then what happened? And then I sold the cosmetic company. And then at that time I actually went to boarding school. I went to Paris. I fell in love with writer. I went to Paris for four years by then. And then I came back because, and then when I came back, that was difficult because I felt like I had lost my identity. All the product that carried my name were licenses. They weren't really listening to me. And I felt like I had no identity. It was very weird to a point that I got cancer. I got cancer at the base of my tongue, which I think has to do with fact that I couldn't express myself in any case. At that time, somehow I discovered QVC. So QVC was absolutely, I mean, this tacky network that would sell, you know, things. And I went there with Marvin Traub. You know who Marvin Traub is? Yep. Yeah, I know who Marvin Traub is. It was. Bloomingdale's. And so I, and they were dying to do something with me. And I thought they wanted to do cosmetic. No, they wanted to do clothes. But how can you sell clothes on television without thinking? But anyway, they were making me an office. So I said, let me think about it. And I went to Hong Kong to the sales manufacturers. And I came up with this concept of silk assets. And so there were five pieces, a big shirt, a pull-on pants, a tunic. I forget what that is, five pieces in two prints and four coordinating colors. And I said, okay, so I'm going to make me, because that's something you could buy without trying. And so we did that. And that again, was a huge success. And did Barry own QVC at that time? No, I am the one who brought Barry. When I, while I, You brought Barry to QVC. I brought Barry. At the time, Barry and I were two losers. At least we felt like it. He had left Fox and I had, and I felt like I was a total loser. And so we basically didn't have a job either or anything to decide for two people who had been, you know, wounded kids in their 30s and 20s. So, when I went to QVC the first time, I told about that to Barry. And by the time I had my first show on QVC, and I killed it, I think we sold a million, two in an hour or something. I went back to the hotel and I got flowers and Barry said, welcome home. He had taken over QVC. Crazy. True power couple, the definition of power couple in the dictionary. But you know, in a weird way, and he's writing his memoir now, so next year, that's going to be some bomb. In a weird way, we, our lives have been very parallel. You know, I moved to Miami Park this week first, and then he came, and then I discovered the, those two young guys with the dream of doing the highlight. We became the major funder for the highlight, and then he did the little island. And then, you know, for some weird reason, our lives are parallel, and we, we are always at the same time. Yeah, it's very, and now it's, you know, today or after tomorrow is 25. No, what are we talking about? 49 years that I married. So you've been friends for 49 years and married for over 20. No, first we were lovers. It was a big, huge love affair. Then we were friends, and then we were lovers again, and then we were my mind. Do you feel like that partnership, obviously it's your life partner, but in business, like how much are you two engaging with each other about that stuff? Not very much. Like giving each other advice or? Not in a weird way, not very much, because I get impatient and he gets impatient. My son is, yeah, my son is involved. So you can't answer the question from my puck colleague, Bill Cohen. Was Barry ever really serious about acquiring Paramount this year, or is it just a big head fake? No, I can't answer that. Paramount is to Barry, is Paramount will be in Barry's heart forever. Okay. You understand, he became chairman of Paramount at 32 years old. This was, so Paramount, and that's when he met me. So Paramount and the mountain of Paramount is in his heart forever. So, you know, it was a dream, but it wasn't.

So, when you had these sort of big changes in your business, then in the late 90s, it changed again, and you had all the success in the contemporary market. He doesn't know about the rag trade. He's not being like, yeah, you should do that or no. No, but he did help me when I was negotiating with Carl Rosen. He tried. I mean, yes, he gets involved when he needs to get involved, but not really. Anyway, so how did that happen? So, yes, after QBC, that was a success. So, I'm feeling like I'm a pioneer game. But I know that QBC is not really what I want to do. I want to make flows for people like me. So, then, oh, then, yes, inventory was always something that I hated. And so, I thought- Do you think inventory is the biggest problem in the fashion industry, not being able to manage it properly? Well, in my case, it certainly was something that I hate. So, I always try to find shortcut. So, I thought at the time, I still mess with this, you're so knowledgeable. It's easy to talk to you. At the time is because when I started, there were 1,300 good department stores in America. When I slept around the country doing my personal appearances, all the department stores, they were privately owned. And usually, it was the owner of the store who would pick me up in his car and drive me to the TV station and then drive me to the store. And they would call their clients patron. They were the heads of the community. Then what happened with the malls and with real estate and all the malls, the department stores had started to build branches. One branch there and another suburb there, another branch. And that's how they started not to be so profitable. And that's when the mergers happened. And then the mergers and mold mergers, and before you know, there's three department stores. You know? So at the time, my idea was when federated was at the time it was called federated. And then it all became racist. When federated happened, I thought, okay, I was successful in home, in beauty, and in fashion. Why don't I become a private labor for one of these massage stores? I said, I will design. I will help you source. We will work at that. But you own the inventory and you pay me a commission on cost. And so I had this massive idea, which was a great idea. And so I remember Alan Queston was the head of federated. He said, great. And we start to negotiate. And I realized that for them, it was going to be a big investment. So I say, listen, this is what I'm going to do for you. I'm going to write a book. And that book was called Signature Life. And I will tell the story of until now. By the time the book comes out, we will launch the book and I can go through your stores do personal business. And I'm going to buy this little house. It was a little house on West Welp Street, which used to be a studio of a painter. But before that, it was a military stable carriage house. And I say, I'm going to. And then that will be the showroom. I mean, that would be the design studio, but also the showroom for your bias. So your bias can come and work with the designers, blah, blah, blah. I had it all wrapped up and see. We are about to sign Mr. Questrom leaves his job and goes to Disney or some other job. And so then my anyway, my deal fell through. No, we don't think we want to do it. So I was really upset. So then I called Rosemary Bravo, who's then the president of Saks. And then became the CEO of Burberry, right? Right. And she always wanted desperately me to bring back the dresser. She would. She before that, she had been my buyer for cosmetic. And she wanted so much, so much me to do the best. Yeah, you have to do the dresses. So I called Rosemary and said, you want me to do the dress? Let's do this. And that's when I started again. It was more or less 97 98. And that's when Paula came in and Paula. Paula Sutter. Paula Sutter invented. She basically invented the contemporary because there was no contemporary. It was either this Andrew and theory. That's one. That's one. And you guys. Yeah. So nice to have someone who's knowledgeable. It's fun. I'm a student. I'm a student of your history. Where did you work first? I remember. Well, I worked at Forbes. That's where I first interviewed you. But then I worked with Imran for a long time. Yeah. So I've just been doing it. But I remember interviewing you when I was at Forbes so long ago and editor from the FT came. It was at your store and she hand wrote her notes. We were all recording you on our phones. It's probably 09 or 2010. And you let her hand write her notes. You were so patient. She would ask you a question. You would answer and she'd spend all the time hand writing the notes. I'll never forget it. Oh, yeah. Because it felt so. Okay. Yeah. But you were so patient with her. It was incredible. But so you and Paula had an incredible run. And I remember. But we had an incredible run. I mean, that was my second thing. It was a great run and it was great. And it lasted really until 2014, I would say. More or less. Oh, 13. I think she left. And then I was stupid because then I said, okay, now. But I mean, we had 100. It's a story. I mean, we were really great. And then I said, now we should go on steroids, whatever. And then I met Silas Shaw and then he introduced you. He said he was interested and introduced me to this guy. And then I made a deal with him. And that was, and then he, he spent so much money. He opened so many stores and I started losing money. And, and I didn't like that. And when, when that guy came in Paula left. So that was that. And then, and then all that until, well, I, I mean, that man didn't last because that wasn't possible. And then that's it. And then COVID and now. And so now, where am I now? So now I, for the last three years, my Chinese partner, I mean, my Chinese distributor took care of the business, but they started to, not to listen to the design. You see, DVF has a very specific, I mean, it's very specific. And that's why I like the fact that they call this exhibition woman before fashion, because me, it's woman before fashion. I became a woman in charge because of my business. I make clothes for the woman in charge, which means that I don't mind making uniform for the woman in charge. Not woman in charge. She could be four things. You're the same woman and have four attitudes. You could be a boss lady. You could be off duty, right? When you relax, you can be a diva when you go out and you think, and a hostess for me. Those are the four attitudes that a woman has. I give enormous attention to fabric because fabric is everything because it's how it feels in your skin. It's the quality of it. Fabric is first. Then you learn how to color the fabric and to print the fabric. Print is my strength. I mean, I make prints all day long. And because I photograph everything, all my installations come from nature. The movement of nature, the days, and then the silhouette. And the silhouette has to be effortless, easy. It has to look very simple, but yet have all the tricks of old-fashioned, old-fashioned sawers, sewing people. You know that because you follow the body. So in other words, DVF has a very specific DNA. And these people, they were the fabric were getting cheaper. They were trying to do all these things. And I realized that if they keep the operation a few more years, I will have nothing. And I did refuse when COVID came, I could have sold for hundreds, for lots and lots of money to somebody who owned the name, the archive and everything. And I was done. And I didn't want to do that. So, all right. So then I go to Domenico de Sole. I invite him to lunch. I say, Domenico, you are the pope of fashion. Tell me. I mean, I realize that this brand has value. It has asset. We have one dress that has been selling for 50 years. Nobody can claim that. Nobody has a dress that's sold for 50 years. And every 20 years is the 20 years old who discover it. We have a very specific design vocabulary. And we have, and more also more important than anything, I have a relationship with women for 50 years. You know, when I was 25, my mother was only 48, right? So I had her generation and some of the generation people, and my generation, my daughter's generation, my granddaughter's generation, I have touched so many women. And because, as you say, I speak very openly, people can relate to that, you know, because nothing is more inspiring than the truth. So I have this relationship. I told, I met these people at YouTube the other day. I said, you know what? Instead, I'm the grandmother, maybe the great grandmother of influencers. I was doing social media before there was social media. So all of these assets is, I saw, I tell that to Domenico, and I said, what do I do with the business, meaning who could take advantage of all of this? And then he said something I didn't want him to say, he said, you know, you should hire Zilio and have him do a plan. So I hired Gazziano De Boni, who I had met, who's very nice and Italian. And I liked it because he started the game with the manufacturer. I like, I like people who start with the product because it's, it's all start with the product. And I like people who understand products and who have touched it. And so he went to China and he came back and he said, you know what? You can't continue like that. And with that, it's going to be worthless in two years. And so I decided, okay, so I'll take it back. And now we're starting in February. We will have the control of the product. We already, I mean, we will have the product that will come down out in February will already be the new product. And so control of the product and control of the narrative. And really focus very much on the digital and focus very much with the relationship with the world.

One thing I wanted to ask you about is the department store and the distribution element of it. And you have gone, you were wholesale, then you had a, you were a mix of wholesale. Then there was a stint in the mid 2010s where you were really focused on direct to consumer when you hired Jonathan Saunders. I remember seeing you at a WWD conference. I think it was 2013. And so maybe it was like right before after Paula left. And I remember you saying to the audience, to the department store owners and the store owners that you need, you said, we need your help. This is not a partnership anymore, essentially, like that the dynamic and the power had changed. What do you think now, like you've been through every single phase of this business for the last 50 years and experienced the highs and the lows? Like what do you think the next 10 years of the fashion business and the way consumers buy fashion is going to look? Like when I think of stores, I think they need to exist, but most people just go to try stuff on and then they buy it online. So I'm curious what you think. Well, I, I just, first of all, who knows what the planet is going to be 10 years from now. There's no, there's no industry that you can actually predict. There's nothing that you can predict right now. Right now, I'm in reverse of my scenes, you know, praying for this election. And that's why I talk to the woman and that's why I just talk to the woman, talk to her and, and follow her and go on digital and do pop-ups and do some partnerships and stores, but on your way, in your, you know, is it there? It's crazy. Companies that you think they're so big and so, and they're cracking, you know. So the, listen, do you think I would like to start now on my age? It's absurd. It's ridiculous. But also there's an advantage and that goes back to the, the being a survivor, you know, there's an advantage. I mean, the company has never been smaller than that now, but there's an advantage. The name is completely virgin everywhere. I have no ties. I have no, and therefore you can, you can design your future in a way that is true to it. Just like us as individuals, the most important thing is that, you know, to be true to ourselves. It's the same thing for a brand or for a business. As you're getting the brand back in order, are you thinking about legacy and succession planning and how do you see the brand being set up 20 years from now? No, right now I am actually, I don't know if I said that before, I'm starting, I'm in the win, I'm in the winter of my life. I hope it will be a long winter because I have a lot of energy, but I am in the winter of my life and my, right now I am in operation legacy. I am, you know, I build the building for my archives, not just the dresses and the fabric and the collection of textile, but the cultural archives that I have because I was photographed by everyone, illustrated by everyone. I mean, I have a zeitgeist of 50 years, you know, so I want to put all that in the foundation. The business I want to set it up so that it's very clear what the vocabulary of the brand is so that at some point, you know, who knows, whether, I don't know, but at least the base, it's like being able to take a brand that's 50 years old and being another person. You may as well take advantage of me, I'm still alive. Let me put it in order, at least from the inception of it and then we'll see. And then the third thing, which is very important to me, is this in-charge movement that I have started and that also started completely by accident. You know, I used to say, I didn't know what I wanted to do, but I knew the kind of woman I wanted to be. I wanted to be a woman in charge and I became a woman in charge and I became a woman in charge because of a little dress and because I'm a feminist and I fight for women and I, you know, I mean, that's very important in me and I help women and that, that, that, that. I, you know, and I've always celebrated international women's day when nobody knew what it was. And these international women's day are always women in charge. Then a few years ago, I started to think, what does it mean to be in charge? Is it aggressive? And then I thought, no, what it means to be in charge is a commitment to ourselves. It's owning who you are. You own your imperfection, they become your asset. You own your vulnerability, you turn an interest rate. And that is the practice that I advise everyone to do all the time. When you're very, very high at your success, don't believe your own bullshit. Don't be delusional and know that it can change. And when you very know, know that, okay, it's this door in the open, but it's because another one is meant to be. That's the thing. And then once you do that on a daily basis and you stay as true to yourself as you possibly can, then you start to think also about others. Because I believe my, that's my new thing, that kindness is a currency and it compounds just like money. And generosity is the best investment. And I am determined to make kindness sexy. Because right now, what is sexy is conflict, conflict brings ratings, conflict brings whatever. And I think that kindness can do just the same. And then there are the four steps of in charge, which is to connect. I make them, you can make a miracle, you certainly can do it. Make a miracle every day by introducing one person to a person they would have never met without you. It doesn't cost you very much just to write a nice email. And you'll be surprised how powerful your magic wand is. Step number two is to expand the quality time to people that you normally don't talk to or haven't talked to. And you think you do it for them. But if you pay attention to what they say, it will expand your horizon. The third one is inspire. And of course, we know that inspire is about narrative and about storytelling. But what is inspiring in storytelling is not the success. It's the challenges. That is anytime a friend of mine gets fired or gets a bad article or anything bad happened to them. I always pick up the phone and I said, remember, this will be the best anecdote when you write your book or you do your TED talk. You know? Yeah. And then the fourth one is to help others. Anyway. So advocate is the last one. And so that's it. And so I want to turn this kind of movement. I want to turn it into a platform. I would like to make this global platform about interest because it's not it's not selling me. It's selling every every person themselves. So it's very pure and it's very good. And I'm just in full incubation. I don't know what I'm telling you. Well, you've certainly lived your truth today by being very generous with your time. Can we do a quick Sun Valley round? Because everyone at Puck loves Sun Valley. We love writing about it. All the deals. I want to know what do you do at Sun Valley, Diane? Oh, Sun Valley is a conference that's organized by Herbal. And I've been going there for 25, 30 years. I don't know. Is it mostly like hanging out and seeing people you know? Have you ever done a deal there? I don't make any deal there. I've spoken there. But all these conferences, Google camp and Amazon camp, it's always very interesting. I would say that I go to Sun Valley because of bearing. I don't know that necessarily they would invite me alone. I don't know at this point. I feel like you're part of the promenade of the way, which has become a story in and of itself. Especially, you know, that I mean, you see people aging. I mean, I was a young person. I'm now a known person. I mean, it's really, yes, yes. But that's life, you know, that's time. That's the great, great richness of aging. Everybody talks about aging, but it's fascinating to age because first you have made them through this time and the experience and the thing you have seen. So Sun Valley, I don't know. I don't know what to say. Is it the best of those kinds of conferences? They're all different. They're all different. It's very much a banking world, you know? Yeah. Well, I find it interesting to see you all walking up and think about what you're talking about as you enter. Well, next time let me know. I will. I'll text you. Final question, which is usually the first question we start off with, but we really got into it fast. What did you have for breakfast? Well, I have coffee. I have plain yogurt so that I can put my vitamin in it and swallow that. And I had a toast. Perfect. Not very interesting. No, I mean, I'm just obsessed with making sure people are getting enough protein, so it sounds like you are. No, what is the protein? There's no protein. Yogurt. Oh, is there? Yeah, very high in protein. Diane, this was great. Is there anything else you want to say before we go? No, I think I've talked enough. No, but it's nice. It's very nice to talk to somebody who I don't have to explain, that you know all the players and you've been around, but I don't understand how old I am. I'm 42. You're so young. And so you started at 16? I started at 24, 23. But I just never stopped. Most people stop. As you know, I mean, it's the same thing in your business. Usually people give up. I just didn't give up. But Park is nice. It's nice. It's very provocative. It has a purpose. Tell the guys that I said that. I will. They're big fans. They were very excited that I was interviewing you. Okay, so I will see you next time, probably next year. I'll see you. Are you going to be at the CFDAs on Monday? No, I'm going to Europe tomorrow and I will be back after. Enjoy. I voted already and I fear what do you think is going to happen? You know, I really don't typically talk about it publicly, but I am not, I would say I'm not very hopeful at this point. No, no, we'll see. You know, it, it, I keep thinking about what happened in France and it sort of worked out there. And so that gave me a little hope over the summer, but we live in a very different country. I don't understand what, how can people vote for this, this beyond? I mean, it's just so weird. I think it goes back to our education system and there's critical thinking is not taught in schools. And I do think that that is the core of it. But I mean, there are some educated people. Yes, that's true. I mean, that's just money. Money and also I think people are crazy and we're, you know, I don't know. It's, it's, it, yes, money and power and all of that, but, but I do think the lack of the, the education system and how it is managed in this country and, and, and that's an inequality in and of itself that has nothing to do with how much money you have. It's just about not being able to think about things in a 360 way and most people can't. So it's really scary. All right. It was very nice to talk to you. Please come back from Europe though. It was lovely talking to you. Thank you for taking the time. Congrats on the exhibition. I can't wait to go see it. And by the way, you know, very pretty. Thank you so much, Diane. Your best work taught your life. Thank you. I feel a little bit, a little bit prettier. You always look very pretty as well. Good bye. Bye. Thank you.
