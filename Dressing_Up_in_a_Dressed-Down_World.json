Thanks to Rachel Sturgatz and Sarah Shapiro team line sheet for their incredible work this week. I'm headed to New York tonight for a one day appearance to interview Mickey Drexler at Columbia Business School and then it's off to London, Milan and Paris. I can't wait to see you somewhere. Let's get going with the show. Amelia Wickstead, welcome to Fashion People. Thank you very, very much for having me. Thanks for being here. So what did you have for breakfast this morning? I knew you were going to ask me that. I actually, my husband very sweetly makes boiled eggs and soldiers for everyone in the family. But this morning I had porridge, which reminded me of my Italian grandmother who used to shake her hips and make porridge for me as a little girl every morning. So I had porridge and I'm a New Zealander. I have three Kiwis every morning and I drink AG1 every morning, take all my supplements. So breakfast is big for me. Okay, so we need to talk about AG1. When did you start taking it? My husband was an AG1 freakazoid for about three years and then just stopped taking it one day. Okay, that's really interesting. So I actually, years and years ago, my head of atelier, her name is Tony, also from New Zealand, was drinking it and I kept getting sick and it was, I think it was the, you know, the beginning of the end when your body just starts to cave in and you're sort of like, oh, this is what it means to be an entrepreneur. And she said, drink this, it's going to keep you healthy. It's going to keep you from being sick. And it actually did for the longest time. And I'm saying this with a sore throat, but I truly, truly, truly do believe that I, you know, in touch with that I have been lucky enough to sort of stay healthy and it keeps me going. And so I really believe in it. And, and I think also it's from New Zealand. So I'm completely invested heart and soul. What I will say about it, and I have no evidence either way. And I feel like for me, it's like, if something makes you feel good, then you should take it. And it's not going to hurt you. And I'm sure there are some benefits. The big thing is my husband said that it forced him to drink a lot more water in the morning, which is immediately he was like, I realized I'm not drinking the same amount of water because that was the first thing he would do every morning before coffee. And so he need, he needed to like readjust to have like another eight ounce glass of water. And that it might seem like trivial one, especially now that we all drink out of these giant water bottles that are like 58 ounces or whatever. But it is a thing of it. And I also think it's just like a routine. It's like meditation or whatever. If you do it every morning, you feel like, okay, I got that done. I can get everything else done. It is a routine. And it's all your vitamins and minerals all in one. It also tastes great. And then it becomes like a little bit of a ritual. So I'll do lemon and hot water. And then I'll wait 10 minutes. And then I'll do that. And then I'll wait another 25 minutes. And then I'll have something to eat. So I spent a lot of time recently, sort of, I think, having your own business, you know, the same old lines, having your own business, being a mother, and doing all of that, and just constantly being a little bit on a grind, let's say, is sort of just taking care of yourself a little bit more. And that's been part of my routine. And so I continue with it. And as long as it keeps me well, I'm thrilled. How many kids do you have? I have two. And how old are they? So one is just turned 12. And the other is turning 10. Oh, cool. So they're like little people. They are little people that answer back and are really cute and have great conversations. It's really fun. It's a fun need. And at this point in the process, so this is probably going to run right around London Fashion Week, where you're doing a show. We are, what, a month out from there, a little over a month out from there as we record this. What point in the process are you in? Like, what does your day look like as a small business? Well, I don't know how small, but as a business owner, an entrepreneur, and also a designer, and you're like many people in your position, you are probably doing 50 different jobs. So what in the process of the collection are you in right now? And what, like, what did today look like for you? So actually, my Thursdays are always my Head of Department days. So we do team operations meetings, and I, and I touch base with all of my heads of departments, which is always quite, quite a fun day because you hear the ins and outs of the business. When it comes to Fashion Week, it's pretty much all oriented, like, all completely connected to show, sponsorship, stylist conversations, casting conversations, budgets, looking at our, at our skews, like how many units are we, are we presenting, and also cutting skews. And then we're talking about commercial styles that we're going to put into the collection. So I actually thrive. I always say that I'm sort of like built in two parts where I like thrive on the creative part of my job massively, where I'm creating this dream world. And, and, you know, Fashion Week for me is, I guess, where my identity and the world of Amelia Wickstead, which is why I'm doing this, why I wake up every day is put out on a runway and showcase to the world. And it's sort of like, how I want the world to dress, which is very exciting. But the other side of my, of the way that I'm sort of programmed is I love the business side of fashion. And so I love my Thursdays. So that was my Thursday today. But other than that, we are at the moment, adding our last designs into all of our looks that we have sort of lined up on the board. And then talking about how fast we can produce them so that our stylist, we work with Harry Lambert, he'll come in, look at the collection with the Fresh Paravise. And we saw him last week as well. He's a big part of the creative process. And, and so the next time that we can see him. So now it's kind of the fun part that the, that pretty much all of the collection or the majority of the collection is designed. I have you listened to Bella Freud's podcast with her, and she does all the, it's called Fashion Neurosis. I love Bella Freud, but I haven't know you have to listen to it. Jonathan Anderson, one was really interesting because he was really forthcoming. And also he talked a lot about his relationship with Benjamin Bruno. And then it sounds like they're very, very good friends outside. But, and I've been, you know, I've gotten to know a lot more stylists who work on collections over the years. How important is your process with Harry? Is it, does he push back on you a lot? Or is it, or is it, are you totally in sync? Like what, what is that relationship like? Well, I think this will be our third season working together. And I think whoever I've worked with, and including Harry, is that, you know, you immediately feel a connection when you start working together and you, you mold nicely together would be the best way that I describe it. If there's ever this kind of feeling of tension, I mean, by the way, don't get me wrong. I love to be pushed outside of my comfort zone, believe it or not, which some people don't believe that I like to, because I'm very clear and like distinct on like, who our woman is, what our vision is, what our world is, I'm very passionate about that. But I love being, I love being challenged. And I love, I almost thrive off of someone pointing out something that I don't like to hear. And then I like to sort of push my limits a little bit, because my buttons have been pushed and, and, and do something bigger and better. And yeah, and I love a bit of a challenge. So I would say, we mold very well together. I think that definitely he comes in with a different, a different eye, a different approach to like a lot of things, but we're also very much in sync with so many things. And I think that that's really important. Otherwise, if we're too much on two different pages, there's no point. Totally. There needs to be some push pool, but also getting each other. Yeah, having a good time. Like at the end of the day, you know, God, I've spent so many years just being a little bit too serious, I would say, and always being worried about everything. And I think now, now that I'm at the tender age of 41, I feel like I've been doing this from my living, we know, started in my living room, but it's been almost 15 years now. And getting to know like who I am as a designer, what we represent as a brand, understanding what women want. And I think having that confidence, but also knowing that you want to keep waking up every day and doing something a little bit differently is pretty exciting. And so it's fun to do that with Harry. That's, that's really fun. What, what is remarkable about you is I can close my eyes and see what an Amelia Wickstead dress or piece looks like, even the knit that you're wearing is, is yours. Correct? It is. Yes. Yeah. So like a knit is harder, but there's something very, um, there's a smoothness to all the materials you use that it feels like they're all connected. Like, it's not the right word, but it's like a matte smoothness that even in this knit, it feel, I feel the connection from the knit to the dress. And that is, is really rare. What was the London fashion scene like when you started out and you started showing there at fashion week, like 10 years ago, right? So five years into the business, what was it like when you, when you got off the ground and, and what did you feel like you were able to bring so quickly in terms of point of view? So it's really interesting that question actually, because I was first off the boat from New Zealand when I, and then I moved to Milan, my mother married, we actually lived outside of Milan, but I moved to Milan when I was 14, my mother married in Italian. And already that, just before arriving fresh off the boat to London for university, was all of a sudden like this gear change of like walking home from school and bare feet and there being like no designer stores in New Zealand whatsoever, although my mother had her own design business, it was just myself and my mum, my mum was a single mum. And so I knew her sort of, her little business that she had, but even the contrast of going from New Zealand to Italy, and all of a sudden everyone's groomed and very dressed up, etc. I think created this little bit of like a commercial buzz and commercial kind of business mode in my mind. Then I arrived in London and in answer to your question, Web Centre St Martins, and all of a sudden it was this city that had this huge sort of like, you know, everyone was so creative and it was this exploration of like independence and individuality and you could be anything that you wanted to be. And coming from like Milan where everyone was so contrived and it was all very materialistic, etc. It's almost like those two worlds merged. And I took the commerciality of what I was exposed to from the age of 14 and which I loved as well. And then this kind of vibrancy and strength to kind of be whoever you wanted to be of London, combined the two. And I think that's where we sort of stood out a little bit because even in my graduate show at Central St Martins, there are only, I think there were only five of us from my class that were chosen to be part of the press show. And I was by far the most commercial. So there was a way, there was strong architectural design. There were like points of difference. I played on tradition. I had a little twist. That's exactly what I do now. It was very much my voice already. But definitely sitting next to everybody else. I already, I think was painting my own picture in that fashion scene. Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting. Do you think, I mean, there are a lot of people who go to St Martins who are not from the UK. So, but did you feel like because of your mother's business, like what was it that made you not fall in line with everyone else? I definitely think that I had my mother in my ear talking, talking at me, which I think was very much, you know, I wanted to study women's wear and she said it has to be women's wear with, you know, fashion design with marketing. So there was never an option of like, you're not going to have the business side as well. And I think that I think that she, you know, I always when my mother had her business, I saw a lot of the ups and downs. I saw the struggles. I saw the benefits. I saw the happy days, but I saw a lot of not so happy days. And I think that I always wanted to build a business that was profitable, that had growth. Even when I started, I did everything backwards. I started with a bespoke business and I didn't carry any stock. And I built a business whereby the customer had to pay 50% upfront because I always had that fear in me of how am I going to withstand this industry and survive as a brand? And yeah, I think that I always had that at the forefront of my mind, I guess, that sort of answer your question. I guess, yeah. Yeah, I feel like when you're young, it's so easy to be swayed by what's like in the air and even very talented people that happens to. But it sounds like because you understood how the business worked, that from the beginning you were able to like, I wonder if it gave you a little more confidence in not only in your design abilities, but your ability to stay on track, if that makes sense. I think completely. And even when I started from my living room, women would come to me and I was clearly the only person working for my business. But it was really understanding clearly what women wanted. So I was a 23 year old. I mean, what I wanted was a mini skirt, a tight pair of trousers and a crop top. But what did women really want? And I spent the first, even so it was in the recession in 2008 when I took on a store, which all stores were closing down in London and it was an absolute disaster. And I sort of struck the steel. I mean, I didn't even know how it happened really, but it was based on how much money we made, we would pay and rent. So and even, I mean, even the fact that they gave it to us. But I think every, every store was vacant in 2028 and it was a bit of a disaster here. There was a recession everywhere. And, you know, I opened the door of that store with no stock and people had to order up of samples and it was just me selling for the first six years. So I was there Monday to Saturday, understanding who my woman was. And even when it came to, you know, I really wanted to have a show because of course I was like very naive faking it till you make it. And I was 24 at this point. And I would put on a show for customers. So I would have customers, they would have a wish list and then I would, because I didn't have stock, they would put an order in and then I would take 50%. So I did everything completely backwards and I did it for the customer and understood, and understood, I guess, where my niche in the marketplace was. And I think even to this day, I still stand strong and can say, I know where our niche is. I know what, what the Amelia Wicks did world is today. And it hasn't changed hugely. And it has.

What did you learn in that process in those early years about you mentioned what women want, you mentioned having like your idea sort of in place. But the thing that I find really compelling about your work, not only that I can close my eyes and see it in my head, but also that you have, it, the dresses fit, like the clothes fit. That is something that there are designers who never figure that out or never really try because they aren't as interested in dressing a real human. It's more about the idea or what have you. And that's fine. There's a place for all of it. But if you want to be commercially successful, it tends to be about making the customer feel good. What were some of the things that you learned and not just like obviously people have body hangups, things like that, but just generally about how people interact with fashion in those early days that you've sort of taken and used as a foundation for your business. I mean, listen, I grew up in my mother's, you know, store, living room, fitting woman, after woman, I mean, I would sit there and fill her pin cushions and just watch. So I guess, I grew up with this sort of acute awareness of how fabric moves and flatters. I also had my mother sort of taking me in stores when we moved to Italy and, you know, turning a garment inside, inside out and sure and explaining to me that the quality of the inside of the garment has to be as good as the outside of the garment. And oh, look at these, look at this polyester lining or look at this overlock seam versus like a French seam. And so it was very, I would say that, you know, the way I design now, I guess I've got this appreciation for tradition. I've got this sort of romance of the past. I've got this sort of, you know, I don't, without compromising, I guess, on modernity, but I've got this passion about, you know, extreme special craftsmanship and good fit. And that's always been at the forefront of my mind, I think purely because I've just watched my mother for years and years and years and that's always been like what she was all about. It was all about the tailoring. It was all about the fit. She was explaining things to me before I even realized that I was taking them in. I guess, I guess an answer to your, an answer to your question. And I think, you know, I'm always designing for purpose. I'm designing for longevity. I'm designing for garments that you pull out of your wardrobe and use to come. That's always been my thing. And so fit, you know, at the end of the design changes and I love being fashion forward and I love pushing the boundaries and I love creating lots of different, you know, twists on design, but at the same time for me, fit is, is the most important part of it all. But it does come with time and age for sure. Understanding fit better. But yeah. Is there a lot of internal construction in your pieces? There is. But I think also something is that, I think something about our brand is that I think that there, you know, we've got a lot of simplicity and ease and a lot of things as well. And I, and I often, you know, we might have a lot of construction in the garment and then I'll just suddenly pull it all out because I think we are women on the go in today's world. And I think it's very, very different from, you know, from, it's very, I guess as a woman, I'm designing for women is what I'm trying to say. And I know that if I'm feeling, you know, completely like caught up in a garment, I'm not going to feel comfortable. And you know, it all goes back to how does, how does clothing make you feel? It's my job to make women feel proud, confident. I mean, I think that we take it for granted half the time of like how powerful clothing is and how it can make us behave and how it can make us feel like we can walk into a room and achieve anything or how we can converse and, you know, all sorts of these things. So I think that you have to make sure, and I've always said this, that the clothing is not wearing you and that you're wearing the clothing. And so yes, we will have, you know, beautiful corsets and dresses that need a corset because it's a black tie of egg and that's what we're doing. And that's the look and the feel. But I'm very, very, very much about, you know, simplicity and ease and everything that we do and the out of a well-dressed life dressing up for sure, feeling put together. But it doesn't mean that you need to have all of these strange little compartments to an outfit that make you feel completely sort of uncomfortable. You have to feel comfortable in what you're wearing. How does the UK or the British customer and the American customer differ for you? So I was just thinking about your collection and you obviously have a lot of day wear and, like you said, there's a real ease to all of it. But you are known for, you have a big wedding business. You're known for cocktail dresses and things for formal events. And when I think of the UK and all the different fun parties people get to go to there and really need to dress up and wear a fastener or what have you. And the US is a much more casual market, especially for like a cocktail party in the evening. Women don't tend to dress up as much as they might in Europe at all. How does your customer differ given this is such a big market? I'm sure it's a big area of growth for you. And how do you sort of think about that as a designer when you're putting the collection together and then working with your team to merchandise it and all of that? That's funny that you say that because listen, I think in the UK undeniably we've got this sort of unique love on tradition and occasion. And I think that there's a real excitement and experimentation here in the UK with fashion undoubtedly. And I think I love that about the UK. But it's funny because I've always thought of the US a little bit like that as well. And it's funny because America is our fastest growing market at the moment. And so clearly they're tapping into us or that occasion dressing. And that's kind of absolutely wonderful. So we see that the customer is very much like in line with our customer here in the UK. I think that, listen, I think that the woman that we're dressing, and I always say that we're dressing for all women, I think that when we're putting together our line sheet of what are all the designs that we're putting for in a merchandising client and who's our woman and what we're thinking about, I always say we're for all women. So we dress women of all ages and all around the world. And it's funny because we've always been known for occasion. And I think again that comes distinctly from the UK and all the different occasions like you said that we have and that's a big part of our business. But I think that that woman that's shopping with us, she's building out her wardrobe. So now like separates and casual wear, like even this jumper that you were referring to, people don't necessarily think or come to us for that. But that's like a huge part of our business. Denim is a huge part of our business. Holiday wear like cotton dresses, like simple cotton dresses are a huge part of our business. And our customer is she's quite forward and original and she's really bold and refined. But yes, yet also quite refined in her delivery. So she's just a very modern woman in a circle. And it's interesting because we've really got that woman. You know, when you say we don't have them in America, we've definitely got that woman in America for sure. Yeah. Well, so our numbers keep telling us. Well, it's also interesting, like what I was saying, the knit that you're wearing, and maybe it is the architectural thing. Like, are you obsessed with, you must be obsessed with color as well. Because I feel like that's the other thing you're very, I can't articulate this, you probably can. But you have your sense of color, it all does feel, there's something like very rich about the colors you use, or and saturated or something. But it does all feel like it's connected, which is extremely hard to manage this far into a business. So it's funny, I am that's the first thing I start with, often with the collection is my color palette. So it's interesting you say that. And I think that, you know, color has so much, you know, so much impact on on sort of mood and confidence of clothing, I think, personally. But also, I always see everything, especially color, I guess, through quite a rich cinematic lens. And so I look to cinema, anything old world. And I really play into those color palettes. And that's, yeah, that's ultimately how I started collection really. What are some of your favorite movies for fashion inspiration over the years? Like, what was on your first mood board? On my first mood board, well, nine and a half, by Fellini. That was that was actually probably my first, which was all in black and white, of course, but I put color into that. So when we're connecting color, that is nothing to do with color. Honestly, anything from sort of anything from the 1960s. I would love to talk to you about like, our, our most recent collection that we're focusing on. Am I allowed to talk about that? Maybe not. But like, for instance, the director that I'm looking at and the films that I'm looking at, the color palette, I mean, that's like a perfect example of how I hone in on color. So when that all comes to life and you see it, you'll see we look to the costume costume design to the mood of the interiors within a film. Just everything that's that's where I pull my color references from. But I can't tell you what that is. That's okay. You know, by the time this airs, everyone will get to see it in the next day or two or it'll already be available. So what day is your show? So our show is on, on the Sunday. So on the 23rd. I mean, it's, it's basically it's, it's like, it's like the world of Hitchcock, right? So it's sort of how his, you know, let's say his color palette leans into the mood of the film. So if the mood, so if it's really gloomy and scary, but then, I mean, it's so interesting when you read about how he builds his color palette out with his costume designer and how he films something, the setting, the scene, everything. The, if there's something alarming is about to happen, it'll be one specific color amongst, you know, a gray and gloomy scene. It's really interesting. And so anyhow, that's an example of how we would play into color. Okay. Well, I'm very excited to see it. And, and Hitchcock obviously is, is, is for you. I was just watching, rewatching because I've probably seen it 50 times, but the Godfather part two, my husband had never seen it. I did, I did an entire collection based on the father. Exactly. So what is the first wife's name, Apollonia? Yes. That was a huge inspiration for my wedding for, for my dress, like that it's, it's so, there's so much. And I also feel in your work, it feels very cinematic, but also the Italian part, like there is something about what you do. It feels rooted in the UK and, and that Commonwealth thing, but there's also something nodding to that time in your life, I assume. And it feels like you take a lot of inspiration from it. Yes. So my, my mother is half Italian. So my grandmother was from, from Italy, and also was a big part of sort of raising me. And I think definitely, you know, this, her name was Amalia and this Italian woman in my life, who was always, you know, great, great. We didn't have much, but like very glamorous in her sort of like every day. And we always, you know, listened to Frank Sinatra, you know, on repeat. And, and it was very much that kind of Italian upbringing and Italian cooking and all about family, you know, eight children and so forth. And then on my father's side, he's, he's Polynesian from Samoa, like half Polynesian. So it's, it's sort of like, I've had this like real sort of mix of cultures. And then now being very British, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm a British based designer with British, with British children. But definitely. And the God, and the Godfather, that was, I did a show, I remember it was, we ended up doing it in a restaurant, very, very, very Godfather-esque. And it was 90 people. And it was, that was one of my favorite collections, actually. And even the colors and that and all the different references. I love a fashion show in a restaurant. I just become so transfixed with film, you know, when people say, Oh, do you go to an exhibition and become obsessed? I'm like, no, I just watch films. I feel like, even when I was at school, the, I think one day I was talking to my biology teacher and I was like, I feel like I'm in a movie. And she was like, every day you feel like you're in a movie. Look, I feel like that's a great way to live life. I also act like I'm in a movie or live my life like I'm in a movie, romantic comedy. Exactly. But that's how you build out your world. And I think when I think of, you know, designers that I've admired from the past or when I think of like what our world is, it's always, you know, a brand that has created a vision where it's like the world of. And it's this ability, I guess, to innovate, but while sort of honoring heritage. And I'm kind of transfixed by that. And I love it when films do that. And so I always think I've always wanted to build a brand that's all about lifestyle and the world of as opposed to just being, oh, I'm ready to wear a brand. So for us, we have made to measure made to order, which is the modern day version of made to measure. We have a bridal world, we have a vacation world, obviously are ready to wear, which comes to life during fashion week. And then we've got our home wear line. So it's all of these like different parts of our world. Like I'm entranced by this, you know, lifestyle that we've created, I guess. How have you built the infrastructure to create do the made to measure and the made to order? Because that is a tremendous amount of work for you and your team. And I, I'm sure they're the customer retention, not to get too marketing speak, but like the customer retention, I'm sure is incredibly high. But it is just so much work. And your dresses are not their luxury. They're not cheap, but like, they're also not the most expensive, especially they're ready to wear in the, in the world, I'd say that they're probably in the middle of the designer range in terms of price. And so I'm sure you're making a lot of stuff locally or in the studio. How, how have you built that out over the last 15 years? So it's really interesting. It's the heart and soul of the business because we started with them. So when, you know, sometimes when you're forced into doing something because you don't really have another option, I mean, I didn't even know what wholesale was for the first seven years of our business. So when people say, Oh, you've been going for such a long time. I'm like, but I didn't even start selling to stores or had a wholesale business or carried stock for a very, very long time. So I think because it was the heart and soul of our business, I always played on that. And I also, what's really interesting is that I don't believe, I really don't believe that a success of having a business can be purely, I think of this day and age and with a lot, you know, in a lot of ways of what's happened to a lot of our peers and different businesses is that you can't rely purely and wholly on ready to wear. And so for us, for instance, during the pandemic, I mean, did we not have the spoke and bridal and made to measure, we wouldn't have survived it. So I sometimes think it's the gift that keeps giving, you know, I've got people in my atelier that have been with me for 10 years. And it's just a big part of like the heart and soul of our business. I love going in there. I love creating on the spot that that's who we are. And if I take that away, and then, you know, like I said, I love the business of fashion, but I'm taking away the heart and soul of what Amelia Wicks did is and how we built this brand. And, you know, we have the traditional route and why I say that we play on tradition, we play on modernity, but then we've also got for the modern day woman. If you came in and you said, I love the stress you're wearing Amelia, or I love this top, but I would never wear green, I only wear black and white. I'll make that for you in 40 working days with a percentage uplift. And so that's kind of a modern day take on bespoke. I just think it's a really exciting way to build a business. I think there's so much more to just having a ready to wear business. And I think it's almost been a blessing. I always call us slow fashion. It's almost been a blessing that we started everything backwards. We became very grounded and deeply rooted in who we are and what we're doing. And I think that's kind of our secret weapon. You know, so long as touchwood, we continue to do what we're doing. But I do believe it's been our secret weapon. And I don't think many brands have started this way, but I was forced into it. I didn't have any upfront money to build a business from day one. And I had three jobs on the go. And I took 50% payments, as I mentioned earlier, I got on the tube every day, worked with a factory, submitted everything myself. And again, I often, I love there's a quote by Estee Lauder. And I love that she says when she built her business, she did every single role within the business. She worked in every single position. And that's effectively what I've done. And I think that's how you know your business inside and out. And when push comes to shove, and you need to like step in and do something else, you can. You're not just, you're not just a one hit one lead.

It was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out it was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th. Follow and listen on Apple podcasts, the Odyssey app, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcast. Do you feel like you have, you mentioned this heads of meeting on Thursday. So obviously you have learned to delegate at this point in the business. Like what would you say your role other than leading the kind of creative direction is and be now that you do have like a team in place and be what do you want to happen with it? What is your dream of where it could go? Global world domination number one. Listen, I've always seen a bigger picture. Let's put it that way. This was never set out to be like a small bespoke business. That's just the way that we were forced to begin this journey. And you know, we're a company of 50 people. I'm really proud of that. And my position currently is I'm creative director and founder. And I'm also the CEO. So, you know, I very much like I said, I'm kind of split in two ways. And I love both sides of the business. But you know, you're nothing without the people that work for you. And so I think we've been, you know, we've started a business on very small salaries, we worked with extremely junior inexperienced people that some have grown with us and are still here today, which is brilliant. And then, you know, it's a wonderful place to be when you're in a position where you've got sort of the bandwidth to have more senior people and you're learning from those people. You know, I came into this business with only X amount of expertise. So I need to keep learning all the time. And that's a big part of my job, which which I love. But where do we want to be? We want to be we want to be huge. We want to be dressing everybody. America is our biggest target market right now. And it's going pretty well. We want to we want to be the wedding dress on everybody. And we want to be everybody's wardrobe. And I think that that's what's quite nice about us now that we've got so much diversity within our within our wardrobe. I think it's, I don't want to say admirable, but exciting that you are ambitious in that way. Because I would say that a lot of designers in the UK in particular, were almost taught or pushed to not have big business ambitions. And I think it's nice to hear from someone who says, No, I want to be a huge company and I want to dress a lot of people and you want that it's it's, um, if it's refreshing for sure. I think at the end of the day, I, um, I love the idea of constantly creating and constantly pushing myself and pushing our boundaries and hopefully doing something that just continues to inspire people's wardrobes. But at the end of the day, if people aren't wearing it, I don't see, I don't see my purpose. Because for me, I, I guess my job is to, is to educate on how one should dress to the office, dress on the red carpet, dress to go to work every day. And that's what I'm passionate about. So if people aren't wearing my clothing, I feel like my job is my job is not done and my customer, but at the same time, I don't want to stand still with that. It's not about, Oh, I'm just going to, I'm just going to create a wardrobe that season upon season is the same thing. And there's repetition because I know that that sells. I also need to be, and I think that that is what is, um, I like to think a little like, you know, a little, a little place in our little world in this marketplace is that we're continuously pushing our customer and pushing our woman to go out of her comfort zone a little bit as well. So that not every collection looks the same. And that every season you're like, God, I want to wear my hair like that, or I want to wear that blazer in that way. And I want to, but at the same time, she can still pick out any of those items in eight years time and still wear them. And that they're, you know, that they're still, that there's, there's stood the test of time. So, um, yeah, I'm always making sure I'm ticking all those boxes basically. So speaking of ticking boxes, so you have this fashion show coming up. Yes. You know, you never know what will happen. Maybe we'll, we don't know. Like there could be some crazy event and I, we need to run this a different date, but the, the goal is to run this right before your fashion show. So you have this show coming up, hints of Hitchcock, we'll see, we will anticipate. Um, why do you show up fashion week? What, what value? I was just, I just did a little store on Emily Bodie and she doesn't really show, she's probably one of, she's one of the most promising designers in America. Has a really strong brand like you. You can close your eyes and see Bodie. But she doesn't really show up fashion week and she never really has. What, what value do you find in it now, especially in the context of where British fashion is post-Brexit and all that stuff? Listen, at the end of the day, I, you know, I'm a creative and I'm emotional and I think it's an opportunity to communicate an emotion and leave a lasting impression. And I think that it's immersing people, um, in the world of your, of your own season. Um, I think that I'm a very shrewd business woman. So do I have budgets like the big luxury brands and am I, no, but it's my expectation to put on a show that looks sort of like that? Yes. And I think that I love that challenge as well. So if I can continue doing that, because for me, that is creating my world for everyone to see, like there's so much more you can do in a show because it's in motion. It's a moment, it's an experience, it's an experience. And now you can showcase that around the world because it can be videoed and you can see people's expressions and you, you can, you can feel like I said, I'm a very emotional person. You can feel emotion from it. I think that if I can continue doing that, it's different from a photo shoot. Um, and I think that I'm also a bit of an old school kind of traditional kind of person that I love it. So if I can, um, I will continue to do that, but I'm doing it in a very shrewd way. Don't get me wrong. I'm being very clever about it and I'm not closing my eyes to like the realities of what's happening around us and budgets and things like that. And anyone that we work with, when we put on a show, especially production, will definitely know that I'm a very challenging person in that respect because there's also no way that I will jeopardize my business model because I'm spending so much money on a show that I can't afford. So I think as long as I can, um, make sure that it makes sense for my business, um, yeah, then I will. But I think passion is, is, is emotion and being in the moment and what it creates also for morale for your team and like that moment and that feeling is just something that you like take away and thoroughly enjoy. Don't get me wrong. It's like really stressful as well, but it's actually really enjoyable. If you've got the right people in your team, it's incredibly enjoyable and it pushes you. I think there's also something about, and I haven't been, I'm actually going to come for a couple days for London Fashion Week this year, which I'm excited about. Yes. Yeah. I think I will be, I'm landing on Sunday morning. So, so I will request. Um, I would love to see one of your shows, but I haven't been in probably because I worked at a UK company for so long, they had people there. So I never, I would go to Paris a lot and sometimes Milan, but never to London for Fashion Week. I would go on other times of the year. But from what, when I covered eight years ago that I loved is the fact that like there is a real pleasure in going to the shows and taking them in and enjoying the experience that I would argue doesn't exist in any of the other cities. They all have their strengths and weaknesses, but there was something about covering London where people just love, love fashion. They just love it. And they're just there because they, everyone who works in the industry that everyone just loves it. It's like, yes, it's commercial, but it's also just about like beautiful things and that part of it, like you said for your team, it's, yes, it's a marketing tool and it's all that stuff, but it also is just like great to be a part of the community. It is. It's great to be part of the community and, and also back to your point, it is a huge marketing tool. You know, I, I kind of thought to advertising big magazines yet. But, but it's, so that's our, that's our, that's our advertisement this season. And also I think like you said, people here are so passionate and excited about fashion is that you can work with some really unbelievable creatives who are starting out. And I don't know, it's just, there's a real, everyone feeds off of each other. And I think that that's great. And I've, wait, the minute I stepped on the, on the soil here, when I came from Italy, I immediately fell into this world of, you know, people encouraging everyone encouraging each other, being, being independent, being an individual and kind of doing whatever you want to do. So I continue to, to do that. And, you know, definitely we have definitely had, you know, challenges where like, we kind of want to work with a stylist. So I'm styling the show or my first show is I would push play on an iPod doc. I mean, we have done, because it was all about, I want to do a show and I want to be, this is what I want to be. This is, this is how I want the brand to be perceived. And not caring that I didn't have the budgets to do it, but I was going to find a way. And people, you know, throwing in favors, I remember people giving us venues and things like that. And I think that there's a real culture of that here. And you remember those people. And then it's the brand grows and you, you know, go back to those venues, but in a different capacity. And I think that's what's really, really special about London. And yeah, and just being yourself. Amelia, congratulations on all your success. And thank you for being here. We've got a long way to go. Thank you for having me. Now, let's check in in a year or two and you can give me updates. You have like level build domination sky. Congrats on, on building something real that, that has a reason to exist. Because that's really hard. You're, you're, you're quite right. And I count my blessings and listen, I come from a, I come from New Zealand, which is all about that, you know, it's very real. And we're very much, I guess, studying, studying something from the ground up, rolling up the sleeves and and never taking no for an answer. So maybe, maybe continue. Can't wait. Thank you again. Thanks very much. I really appreciate you having me. Thank you. Fashion People is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck. This show was produced and edited by Molly Nugent.
