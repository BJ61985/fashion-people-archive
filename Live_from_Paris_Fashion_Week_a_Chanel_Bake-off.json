And today with me on the show is none other than Steph Yatka. She's here to talk all the Paris Fashion Week news that's fit to talk about. Let's get started. Hey, everyone. Happy Tuesday. Today is a long one, so I will try to keep this short. Steph Yatka and I are in the middle of Paris Fashion Week. We just got back from the Balenciaga show. And so we go through everything that happened this week so far. When you're listening to this, if you listen on Tuesday, we still have one more day of shows, but we talk about what happened in Paris on the runway past week, what everyone is wearing on the streets and also what we're wearing. There's a lot of black going on, surprisingly, of course, not surprisingly, actually, but you know, it's the color of the fashion industry. So be sure to check out Monday's Line Sheet. I have a lot more details on that Dolce and Gabbana fundraising effort. I got some more reporting done over the weekend. Also, my readout of the shows in Paris. You know, Paris is weird. I don't know. It's hard because there's like two shows and then there's no shows. And then there's two shows and then there's three shows. And I always end up like today I was supposed to go to five shows. I went to three stuff. Tomorrow I'm going to go to all the shows. And I don't have to really write tomorrow, so it makes it a little easier. But there's just lots of shows. And also I need to see people and say hi. So can't do it all, people. You just can't do it all. There's also some Chanel speculation and wanted to say big congrats to my buddy, Jacob Gallagher, who started at the New York Times today or, well, started in the New York Times on Monday. He's a new styles reporter. Jacob's the best. I can't wait to have him back on fashion, people. Obviously won't be talking about the New York Times just in that he didn't ever talk about Wall Street Journal. But I adore him. I'm so happy for him. He's a great reporter. He will continue not to scoop me. But I can't wait to see what he does right. That's not scooping me. One little update for you all. And I don't know some of you follow me on Instagram and I also discussed this previously, so I felt I owed it to you. Did carve out time today between Gabriella Hearst and Sakai to go to the row and check that store out in Paris as I reported. I was the first to report that they opened a store and also that there was going to be a cafe in it. Unfortunately, so I get there at, I think, 240 and I stand in line. I'm probably seven or eight people deep. And I was like, man, that's not too bad. I'm not a Q person. Like, unless I know a line really well, like I'll stand in line at squirrel because I know it's not like, I know that it moves pretty fast and I'm not, it's fine. I can bake 15 or 20 minutes into that, but squirrels restaurant in Los Angeles where I live. But anyway, I don't do that because a, I don't know. I just, I'm too old for that shit. But here's the issue. I stood in line for an hour and by the time I left, I was still five people deep. This is very common in Paris. I think there are a few reasons. One is if you want to have a luxury experience, they really want you to be able to, and I, I, the same thing happened. I wanted to pop in La Mer the other day after I went to Uniclo to look at the you stuff and there was a long line. So this isn't, this isn't specific to the row, but I don't know how, how this line was moving real slow. And I guess people are trying on a ton of stuff. I saw the sparkly black pencil skirt that I really want to get. Maybe I'll get it for book stuff that's happening in the next couple of weeks. I don't know. I'm going to look online and see how much it is, but it was really slow. And I ran into my friend, Nicole, who popped into the line with me and she was meeting her friend and we got to talk and catch up, which was really nice. And then I looked and it was like three 40 and the Sakai show started at four. And I was like, I got to go. I can't wait any longer. I leave the Sakai show, which started at like four 40, probably. I'm walking to meet my friend. It's five 15. Nicole texted me. It's like, I just got out. I don't know how much longer she was in line, but I'm guessing for like at least another 30 minutes. It's just too long. But what I will say is the store, first of all, it's painted this beautiful like burgundy, brownish burgundy. It looks really nice. It's very elegant. The inside looked really good. And everybody who was in there was having a great time. The little cafe is very sweet too. I probably wouldn't have bought anything because a, I bought the Slitherjacket a few weeks ago and that's sort of my like big thing for fall. But also B, I doubt that like exchange is that good, even with the D-Tex. It's probably not great. I have bought pants from LaBombe Archer from the row previously, but they were like deeply on sale. So I probably wouldn't have bought anything. It was just been nice to see the environment. I'm a big fan of their LA store in particular, and I've spent way too much money in there over the years and also trying awesome stuff and then buying it with a discount at matches.fashion.com. Like a few minutes later. Um, anyway, I would say you can really see in the store. So I would say go try, go and check it out. Maybe go right when it opens, maybe go at a time that's like less, it's probably not going to be as crazy during when it's not fashion month. And like all these people, the one hilarious thing, and then I will leave you is that when I was waiting, these women came up and they were clearly worked at Margaret Howell, who had a presentation on Sunday that I sadly missed. But, um, it was just so obvious they worked at Margaret Howell. They were in like Corduroy and a little loose and scarves and they just looked at the line, they popped for one second and they, they ran. But I would say go and look in, at least look in the windows. And honestly, I saw the sparkly skirt and you know, if it's not insane, I might buy it. So that's it for me. Let's get started with stuff. This is probably the longest episode ever, but it's worth it. Talk soon. Steph Yatka, welcome back to fashion people. I'm so glad to be back and so happy that I just saw you like two hours ago or three hours ago. It's a guy. I know it's so nice that they sat us together so we could do a little fashion people prep. I like when the PRs get it. Yeah, I agree. I just got some seating for tomorrow where I was like, I don't think that that's correct. We can talk about it offline though. I'm not going to be petty. So it's nine PM Monday. This is going to publish in a few hours. Uh, usually I record this very early on Monday morning's LA time, but, um, how are you doing? What's your, your mental health check? Someone texted me this morning. What's the mental health check at this point in the fashion cycle? Cause you've been doing it since London, right? Yes. Um, running out of clean pairs of socks, tired of water bottles with the cap attached to them, but, um, otherwise feeling pretty good. I think it's been a really exciting season. You can feel things changing, which makes it fun to sort of pop from city to city and show to show and assess that change. Yes. I just realized, so you stay in a hotel, right? You don't stay in an air movie. So how do you not do laundry? I try to do a little bit of laundry, but I mean, I have two suitcases and I've probably packed like 900 pairs of underwear, which is maybe TMI for the podcast, but, uh, I pack a lot. Do you ever go to a hotel where they'll do laundry for you? Is that part of it? Or? Yes. Okay. Yes. Okay. That makes sense. As, as you know, I'm a very much like Airbnb person since like 2011. I was probably the first person to stay at an Airbnb from America to go to Fashion Week. I'm just too lazy to have any sense of like autonomy. Like I like someone to be like, here's your wake up call. Here's your glass of water. Here's like, we made the bed for you. Yeah. My bed is currently unmade. I, but I like being able to do my laundry and making my, my kind of coffee in the morning. So. Yeah, true. It's give and take. Uh, you know, it's like as a control freak, I like to be in control. Even when it makes things harder. You can't relate. So really quickly, this news just dropped, this press release just went out. LVMH, which were the most recent owners of off-white, the brand that Virgil Abloh started in, I want to say 2012 or 2013. Let me look at the 2012. They have sold off-white to Blue Star Alliance, which is one of these like licensing firms that owns a bunch of stuff that we've heard of, but don't shop anymore. So like Scotch and Soda, Bebe, Ale, Tahari, Kenzie, Limited 2, which was a big one, Brookstone, Annette Lepore, Catherine Malandrino. So they've bought off-white really quickly, some background on what off-white ownership structure. So Virgil Abloh owned it, but he, I think he licensed it to New Guards Group. That's who he kind of created it with or who like managed it. And then when he went to Louis Vuitton to be the creative director, at some point LVMH kind of took that over or invested a little bit in it or took a stake in it. It's very complicated. But then I think after he passed away, they bought the whole thing at some point or at least part of it. Maybe Virgil Abloh's family still owns some of it, but it's been kind of running with the creative director who's also a stylist and fashion editor, Ibn Kamara, for quite some time now since Virgil passed away. So, or not exactly since, but pretty much, I think he was named pretty quickly after that happened, maybe less than a year. But anyway, LVMH has sold it. It's not surprising. I have a very small thing in Monday Night's Line Sheet about it. I'm going to do more on it on Wednesday or Thursday, depending on when I have time and I could do a little more reporting about it. But I would say, like for me, the question and stuff, you don't have to engage with this, but is not like what's going to happen to Off-White. I think we can pretty much explain what's going to happen to Off-White in a few sentences. You look at Blue Star Alliance, you look at what they own. A lot of these licensing firms have been trying to buy up cooler brands recently. One of them bought, is it called something social club, anti-social social club, that type of thing. My question is more, what else is on the market at LVMH? I wrote a few months ago that I had heard Kenzo was maybe for sale. There was obviously a lot of speculation that Marc Jacobs was for sale, but they denied that. And I think it was a little more complicated than Marc Jacobs just being for sale. I think someone probably approached them. But anyway, I know you don't want to talk about any of that. I think what I'm curious to know from you as someone who, you are a fashion journalist and you were working at Vogue for a lot of the years that Virgil was at his height. And then also now you work at Essence, which sells Off-White and sells a lot of brands that exist because Off-White exists. What do you think the brand's impact has been on fashion and fashion culture? It's huge. And weirdly, I think we're actually experiencing a season now, Spring 2025, that feels very indebted to Virgil's style of world building. I was talking about the collections on the Metro with Rachel from Washington Post. And it's like the clothes that we're seeing are so interesting and eclectic, but also the way the best designers think is about a full universe and a full lifestyle. The Le Weve show is interesting because the clothes are fantastic, but also because of all of the component parts that Jonathan brings into the world from the celebrities to how it's live streamed to Tracy Emman's little bird in the middle of the runway. And I think Virgil did that in such a human and pop way that is very rare and very singular and really created a level playing field for people to get into fashion. His references were very mainstream, you know, like one of his, I mean, his first LV show was like Wizard of Oz themed, which is something everybody knows. And I think like if one part of the fashion industry is getting more niche and esoteric and highbrow, you do need something that really speaks to people and speaks to the masses and off-white really, really succeeded at that during Virgil's era and today. And also like as an aside, Limited 2 was formative for me. And if this licensing company is looking for someone to bring back Limited 2, please call me. You know, I've actually written about this. They have started to do some stuff with it. So guys call stuff. She's available. And also there Limited 2 is something, I think the issue now is that preteens who, who Limited 2 were the target are basically teenagers now. They're, they have beauty fridges full of drunk elephants. So it's like, it's complicated, but I agree. I think it's, there's a lot of opportunity there. Yeah, I think the thing for me was always that he was making stuff that was going to end up in museums. Like he was an incredible product designer and people sort of associate him with merch culture. And yeah, he made t-shirts with words on them. I remember, what was that? What did I buy? I returned it. But it was like a crisp black was like, yeah, you can wear that. I showed it. I was like, do you think this looks okay with my Celine pants? And he was like, yeah, you can keep it. And I was like, I have to return it. But it was like, he had a lot of stuff with the something woman. Do you remember these? Like, I can look it up really quickly. I mean, while you're looking this up, incidentally, today on Essence, Victoria Beckham launched t-shirts that say David's wife and my dad had a Rolls Royce, which like wouldn't be possible if Virgil hadn't made slogan teas, you know, Totally. High brown and cheek. I'm never going to find this. It's definitely in my photo somewhere. But anyway, the point was it was a really cool sweatshirt. It just wasn't. I looked dumb in it, but it was cool. Like someone who doesn't wear that kind of stuff. I was really drawn to his work. And I think like people sort of think you can just slap a logo on something and then it's cool. And he had so many references and so many references that were so close to mine. Like I only interviewed him probably six times or something. But I we were, I think he was like two years older than me and there were just, it was like one season of off way. It was like hacky sack. Like it was just like so close to us. So, you know, I will see what happens. I know people really loved the last show that was in New York and it got it got great reviews. So, you know, maybe this this company will will keep it and keep it moving in the way it's moving. And we'll see. You can read more about that from me online sheet when Steph is not incriminated. But yeah, I think you made a really good point. And it has just felt like even just going to the shows, we just got back from Balenciaga and. You know, Virgil and Demna were sort of not like clumped together necessarily, but they represented this new era of designer. Virgil went to architecture school and was less or was it was it was it architect or was it product design like industrial design? I don't know. But one of these kinds of practices and whereas Demna is like a more traditionally educated designer and worked at Margiela and all that stuff. But like when they both were appointed, when Demna was pointed at Balenciaga and Virgil at Louis Vuitton, it really like I remember talking to a retail executive and him saying it's just like it's different now. Like they have changed the game. And I thought that this collection, it wasn't like I don't want to say a return to form. Because it this Balenciaga collection, because it didn't feel old at all. But it felt like and I backstage, I asked him, do you feel like you were in control? And he said, I've never felt more in control in my life. Wow. It was the first time since all that crazy shit happened. Like last season was good too. But this one, I was like, oh, this guy is not hesitating in any way. And that felt like refreshing in a way that none of his collections have in the last few years. Do you think that Apple pays for these placements on the runway? Because some of the models had iPhones with the Balenciaga logo on them and then a bunch of like Apple cords, you know, the white charger cord. And it's become so integral to sort of like the language of Demna's Balenciaga like earphones, earpods, Apple products. I'm sort of like, hmm, I don't think they pay for it, but they definitely provide them. That's what my guess would be. Apple is you have to remember that Apple thinks it's a luxury brand also. So my guess is that they either just went out and bought them or that it's just a partnership. I don't think too bad we don't have Dan from around here, but he knows about more about the culture of Apple than I do. But my assumption would be that no, if it was, what was that like weird, the Microsoft zoom or whatever it was called that like. Zoom. Yeah. If it was or Samsung or something. Yes. But I think in this case, it's probably just some sort of coordinated. Who knows? I don't know. When I was backstage, no one asked that question, but it's a good one. I wonder if they'll communicate if any of that stuff like is going to become for sale or anything. Does your bag come with a charging cable? You know, these are the deep thoughts that I was having during the Balenciaga show. What did you think of it? So just for anyone who hasn't seen it, it was like, basically the note he said, said that it was sort of like his returning to, he's been obsessed with fashion since he was five years old or whatever. And or seven years old and kind of returning to his first ideas of fashion. And that's 35 years ago. And I thought, I mean, to me, it looked a lot like what when I was a teenager. What like his idea of what when we were teenagers, what was cool? There was a lot of low rise jeans. Yeah. And and also it was interesting. There was all the like lingerie. Yes. And it was all, um, Lea Trenikov's like, you need to do a clip of all you pronouncing stuff wrong. You know the trompe-loy? Trompe-loy. Yeah. Yeah. That was all trompe-loy. So like, and there was tons of trompe-loy and there has been a lot this season generally, like lots of t-shirts on backs and things like that. But it was like the most straightforward sexual thing I've ever seen from him. Yes. I mean, it's a real shame that you don't see the backs on the Vogue-Renway pictures. I mean, this has been like something that we've talked about when I was at Vogue-Renway for ages. But like, I think almost like 80% of these looks are like backless. Like literally the back of the dress is open and like fastened with ribbons, like a corset. And it's funny that you don't see that at all when you look at the picture. It just looks like a normal dress or a normal jacket, which is probably some clever statement about, you know, flashing photography and how we digest images. But I thought that created like a really beautiful trains behind all of these really basic things, like jean jackets, polo shirts, puffers, like whatever. There were just like shreds of ribbon falling behind. So that was fab. And I love to hear Britney Spears on the soundtrack and Lindsay Lohan in the front row. I mean, it was like there was a part of me when the polo shirts came out, like the striped polo shirt with the low rise jeans and Britney Spears is playing. I was like, this is like my dream fashion show from 2004. Totally. Oh my God, I didn't even see Lindsay Lohan. She looked really great. It's so good. There are so many celebrities. The polos were like a tad triggering. That was like post high school for me. So I was a little bit because I'm much older than you stuff. But I was a little bit like, I'm too cool for this. And he did a show in LA. I don't know if you were there. Yeah. Yeah. So like that show, I also thought was like very much of that era. But this felt it's not nostalgic, but there was something like innocent about it, where he was really digging at it at the show in LA. This felt like more innocent and more like you could almost see the people he grew up with or something. Yeah. I mean, I think he's really great at sort of. Showing you something you've already seen or something you already have a familiarity with in a new light. But what I think was like really. What has been really exciting for me across like four cities of fashion shows has been seeing things that you've never seen before, which I think that feeling is so rare, especially in our like post irony age. But going to that Clone des Garcons show, obviously like very conceptual, deeply unwearable clothes. But like my jaw was dropped for the full 20 minutes of that fashion show. So I didn't go. What was I know I'm not. Here's the thing. When I worked a business of fashion, there was literally no reason for me to go. I was never going to do the reviews. There were like five people from business of fashion that wanted to go to all the comb shows, the comb universe shows. And then also, so if I went, I would have had a very shitty seat and like, or it would have been annoying for them to beg for me to have it, like the fourth person to have a ticket or whatever. And then last season, I was like, I'm going to go to all of them. And I did. And it was amazing. I'm really glad I went. I feel like for what I need to do for my job and also for this point, it might. Fashion education and also my mental health on Saturdays, the Saturday of Paris fashion week, I didn't go this year. I was just like, I'm not going to do it. And I love working with them and I love that business and loved over street and all of those brands, but it just, um, you got to like pick your lane sometimes. And for me, Japan Day is something I've decided that for now, I may, you know, next season, I'm going to, someone's going to listen to this and make me feel bad next season. We were like, please let me come to every show I'll stand. Anyway, what made this comb show the most special? It was so singularly bizarre in a way that like you always expect to see, you know, gigantic shapes, interesting fabrications, like things that feel closer to sculpture than clothes. But this was on a whole new level of sort of like unwearability and performance art that was like gripping. I think the thing that Korm Day Garcione does so well is also the staging of their shows is like incredibly heightened and dramatic. Like even if they have the biggest venue in Paris, I mean, we were in, I think it was like a parking garage that they had, but still the runway is like so small. There's only three rows of seats. Everyone is like crushed in next to each other. You know, you can like hear the person next to you breathing, which adds this just like really intense sense of drama. You know, a lot of the themes of the clothes were about like war and displacement and blood and like the female body in a way that felt grotesque and upsetting. But then the show ended with these three white kind of like clouds. And I think like you can see so many fashion shows that are like lights go down, like techno music begins. Like here comes the first girl, her hair is flapping in the wind. Like and it just all looks like stuff that I think what's really stuck with me has been shows that have like a really big emotional component. And that's more than just the clothes. It's like the whole experience of going to a show. And you know, few people do that as well as Rey Kawakubo and sort of like the whole Korm Day Garcione universe. Yeah, it's just also like when in your life are you going to see someone wearing like a pink brocade trapezoid as an outfit? Not only. It's a palette cleanser as well, I think, between sort of like fashion brands that exist to sell product, fashion brands that exist to sell handbags. And then fashion brands that exist to sell ideas. And I think the brands that are selling ideas are the ones that are going to come out victorious this season. Yeah. I hope. I mean, here's the thing. Look, like Korm Day Garcione is an amazing business. Yes. So like they have an amazing business. They sell really conceptual work at a very fast clip and they also sell a lot of t-shirts and a lot of other stuff. And you, a lot of people have talked about the universe, the fashion universe writing itself. So this idea of like, we saw a bunch of creative director appointments where the designers were like commercial. And the idea was that they were going to sell even more stuff than they sold before. And I think what happened was what Europe has done and European executives have done better than I'd say American executives and why the business here has really thrived over the last 20 years. It's like, if you have a really creative person making awesome stuff, it's sometimes that stuff's sellable. Sometimes it's not. You can sell other things. So like a great example of the sort of ideal type of creative director right now is Jonathan Anderson and Loewe. And the show on Friday, I thought was really, really great as always, but it was like, Oh my God, this guy is it. He to me is like the talent of his show. Yes. The ultimate. Yes. He has, you were talking about this set. He has the set. He has the celebrities in the front row. It's all the coolest celebrities. It's all the like most serious actor celebrities who are also cool and good looking. He has them all. There's not one that isn't interested. Then he is designing like pretty conceptual stuff. Obviously has, takes a lot of references from other designers, but so do most designers. Not everyone is Ray Kawakubo. So like there, it's okay. And then he's also selling high top sneakers. So like a person who shops a lot, who follows my work, message me and said, I know those sneakers are going to fly. And it's like, Oh, also he made an amazing pair of like twisted waist trousers that I want. So there's just sort of something for everybody, but also it makes you think like the thing that I think happened is in the past couple of years, the business got so big that executives just got scared and they were like, how are we going to get bigger? We've become more generic. And for a while that worked. And now there's just like a really big pushback to it. And you see in the brands that are like, quote unquote, successful at the big houses, it's often the brands that are on the smaller size that are generating a billion dollars a year in sales, not eight billion dollars. And that's what people are really attracted to. I also loved at East Lamans lookbook and collection, which I thought was so good and did have like a lot of things that sort of look like Chanel, but I was looking with someone who works at a magazine. She did a market appointment. I don't want to out her here. She's showing me all the photos from the market appointment. And there was like a lot of Balenciaga references to and she went up to see the tour as well. It looked, it was incredible. It was so good. And so, you know, his idea is sort of the same idea every time, but it's an idea. And I think with Virgil and Demna, because they were a little bit punk about what the way they did it, people who weren't as deep as they are sort of took it for face value and tried to copy that. And that's doesn't work. And so it's kind of going back to, oh, you have to actually give people something to think about or they're not going to want it. Cause like why I was talking to an investor on Saturday morning and they were like 20 years of buying stuff. If you have five air mess bags, you don't need another one. No matter how rich you are, like why would you need, if you have 40 air mess bags, you don't really need one. You have to be given a reason to buy more. And that's if you're shopping, she in her shopping, Zara shopping, Dior. Like it's all sort of the same way of thinking about consumption. Yeah. I thought that this season was good. I think Paris is really long and it's harder than Milan or even New York and London, I don't go to London, but I might try to go next year and go to Burberry. But it's harder to tell a story in Paris because it's like starts on Monday night really with the car, which I didn't go to, but it was fun. It was great. I just like really, but I really focused on doing meetings and did like three shows a day and that day I didn't do any shows. I just, I just worked, but all the way to tomorrow night, Caperna. So it's like, that's a lot. And then in between there are tons of these like, we have tons of $22 billion a year business, Dior's, you know, I think it's probably over 10 now, Chanel's 20 something. Like these are giant businesses. And then you have like Marie Adam Leonard or, I don't know if I'm pronouncing her name right, but Hoda Kova at the beginning and you have the row and you have like, there's just so. There's so much. It's like getting like pelleted by like paintball shots all day. It's like every show has like a huge gravitational force around it. And that happens like seven, eight, nine times. You ever hit that moment when your kid asks for help with homework and you're like, wait, when did long division get this complicated? Or maybe your child's flying through lessons and getting bored in class. Yeah, been there. Whether they're struggling or soaring, IXL can make a real difference. IXL is an award winning online platform that helps kids really understand what they're learning. It covers math, language, arts, science and social studies from pre-K through 12th grade.

We started to talk about it at Sakai, which was, let's just talk about Sakai first. So, Sakai was awesome. Sakai was incredible. And actually, we haven't indulged ourselves on the podcast yet to talk about the millions of designer change-up rumors that are afoot. But I really think, and multiple people texted me this after the Sakai show, that like, if you're hiring a new creative director for anything and you're not thinking about Chitose Abe, you're insane. Her deafness making clothes that are conceptual, that are wearable, that are streetwear, that are luxury, that are feminine, that are masculine, that are punk and that are sophisticated is like almost like unmatched. And she's so fun and so nice and just seems to never run out of ideas. And that show to me was like, give her everything. I agree. I mean, it was very nautical themed as well. So it just, it did feel very Chanel. Like everything right now is about Chanel. We are going to talk about the, we're going to do a follow up to our Sophia. We're still, we still want Sophia, but we're still going to make it happen in our own way. We're going to make it happen. But so much, it was so aerodynamic. There's something about her stuff that like reminds me of a bird. But that one piece that was like a stripey dress that came down and I just looked at you and I was like, holy shit. She's just, she really has it. And her work looks like no one else's. It feels like so powerful and empowering. Like it's just so, she's so fabulous. And I totally agree. And it's interesting, like undercover thinking of two Japanese designers in that world, I feel like undercover is the same thing. Like I walked down those stairs. Did you go to that? It was, I didn't. It was in the basement of Dover Street. They had a sort of market setup of all this Japanese breakfast food that felt like I didn't end up including that in my write up because I just got too long. But it felt like it was a part of the presentation. Cause it's just so beautifully. There was just all these, all these cakes and like different little items. And it felt like so, it's so meticulous. And the clothes were so meticulous, just like very thin seams down a dress with dotted with safety pins, but in this way that looks so, so specific and meticulous is the best word. Like it's just so finely done and so beautiful. And, and yes, it's punk, but it's also really, really refined. And I was just thinking like, I would love to see his take on the queen, like, or another house or whatever. And I wonder, I mean, this is a sweeping generalization, but I do wonder a lot of the Japanese designers aren't really in the mix for those jobs, even though they are revered in the industry. And I wonder if it's part of Japanese culture to not be as interested in those kinds of gigs because, you know, a lot of these designers live in Japan. And also just like the way Japan is like a very entrepreneurial culture. I'm curious, I have no idea, but it is interesting that like all these amazing designers come from that world and they're all interconnected. And yet none of them are ever up for these jobs. And it doesn't totally make sense. No, I think you would know more about this than I do, but it seems like French conglomerates just want someone under their nose. Yes. 24 seven that they can supervise even when they're not in the office. And I think, I mean, even Pharrell had to move to Paris to do LV. Totally. Exactly. So that that part of it is really interesting. Was there anything else? And oh, Valentina. Yes. So what did you think about it a little bit? I wasn't there. So I've just been voraciously consuming the pictures on Instagram reels. I was just revisiting it before we're recording this. I think like there's a lip and see or like I'm a little champagne drunk on a fabulous yacht in the Mediterranean. And like I'm feeling sexy and naughty vibe that I think you could feel in some of those in some of the Valentino, Valentino shows that maybe you don't feel in this collection. But I don't know if that's just because looking at a two dimensional picture like doesn't capture the spirit. I mean, the clothes are gorgeous and there's so many great ideas in that collection. And I thought it was styled really well. I know people are like, it looks like Gucci. And I'm like, it doesn't really. It doesn't. I preferred it vastly. I never really liked the Gucci stuff. I understood and like respected it. But I was always like, whoa. Yeah, it was a lot. It feels really contemporary to like it feels really modern, great clothes that you can wear and have a great, fabulous life. And I think that's sort of the message of Valentino. Yeah, I think the thing I think what it's what is it's a really interesting point. So I was lucky and I got to go and what I and I only saw I saw Alessandro's last show, Gucci show, which with the twins and I went to the press conference after and he was like, I'm miserable. I hate this. I want to leave and I leave a Tim Blanks. And I'm like, that guy's not going to work here anymore. And Tim was like, no, no, no, it's fine. And I was like, no way. And two months later, he quit. But or whatever happened. But anyway, I always was sort of like there's something I wrote something undisciplined about the work at Gucci. Like I understood why people loved it and they were into it and it like made them. It's like a drug. You're just overwhelmed by it. But I I was always like, this this is a folly, like it's not going to last. Whereas what I think is really good about the Valentino is that he had a framework and he kept talking about I'm in someone else's home or I'm in another man's home or something like that. He's very poetic, but but wearing his techno is my boyfriend. Cap sitting in a throne, but there's a framework and I love 70s, 80s, Valentino. So to see all those like sculpted ruffles, which is something he did at Gucci, but just looked different. We were talking about the Italian journalists were asking about the polka dots. Like there were a lot of polka dots. I love polka dots. I loved all the shoe shapes. And I think that's the other thing. His CEO, Jacopo Venturini is a merchant by trade, merchandiser by trade. So he like knows how to do it. The bags are really nice. The shoes were all these different vintage shapes, like a bow flat, a sling back in in really nice textures. I love the jeans had like calico tipping on the on the pockets. Just like really nice details. And all this to say, because our reader, our listeners, our mix of like industry people and people who don't really know a ton about fashion. I won't wear any of that. And it doesn't mean anything. Like I loved it. It was probably, you know, your personal taste does get into it. Like I didn't really love low eva. And it is also stuff that I would wear to an extent. But you have to really take yourself outside of it. Like there are a lot of shows that I, I obviously wear a lot of the row. I don't think this is like the best show they've ever done. And you have to, you really have to take yourself out of it. Yeah. I thought the show was awesome. And I was just like, I liked it. I thought it was much bigger idea. And I think someone who can't control themselves needs some restraints. And so he got it. But the point you're making, someone said to me, who is like a big consumer of fashion and in the industry said, I bought a ton of Gucci the first couple seasons in this, I wasn't like immediately, Oh, I have to have it. And so I will see, like the test is going to be, is if people buy it and not just the devotees from Gucci, but like a new generation of customers. And also the sexiness thing. It's an interesting point that I didn't really think about when I was there. It, it wasn't sexy. And right now a big reason for this is Phoebe Filo, whether or not she's directly influencing the shows or not. Like Demna is not influenced by Phoebe's work directly, but like the fact that he showed something that felt like at all sexual is new. And right now I think in, did you read Alexa Chung's profile, the one that just Katesta did in the New York times? Yes. She, I've been thinking about it a lot today because of this Valentino collection. And she was talking about, I think she's 40 or she's around my age, but you know, 2011, 2012, a lot of those Peter Pan collars. Yeah. And I think like people my age, and you also, you're very precocious and started working when you were 20 or whatever. I think we've already told the story of how I tried to get you to quit college. But, um, but anyway, no one who was into clothes was like trying to look sexy. Yeah. Like, no, no, of my whole adult life. Like it hasn't been, it's not like you want to look sexy, but you want to, like, I don't know. It's just hard to explain. And now I feel like, and I did an interview with Yael Aflalo, who found a reformation and she started this new brand Aflalo that just launched. And she said the same kind of thing. Like, and it's funny when I did a thing at Lucky Magazine with Alexa Chung, where we went to reformation and she tried a bunch of stuff on. We did like a video shopping with Alexa Chung or whatever. So it's a funny sort of confluence. But yeah, I also the same thing. Like it's not about like wearing like slutty clothes, but it's about like looking sleek and not being uncomfortable with like showing off your body a little bit. Whereas like literally for the last 15 years, that is not, that was not in the conversation unless you were a hoe. So it's interesting. So I see that I think the thing you're picking up on that, like that sexiness from Valentino in the seventies and eighties feels really like of this time. And the fact that that wasn't like super prevalent in this collection, maybe it will be at retail. We don't know. But it's an interesting point. And because he isn't like, he isn't the kind of person who's sort of driving that conversation. No, but I do think like another brand that felt sexy or even like sensual was Chloe, like it's not a hot brand, you know, but it's like the way that the fabrics move around the body and the things that are sheer or the things that are lacy or even some of the like voluminous shapes have a sensuality about them. I mean, I felt also the same way about Simone Rocha, which is very not a sexy brand. It's like big pink poofs. And yet like at the show, there's like a little tinsel undies. I'm like, I visited the Simone showroom and they have a black pencil skirt, sexy by nature with a sheer circle cut out right over the crotch with a rhinestone flower on it. Amazing. And I was like, well, obviously need that. But you know, I think like I'm looping us together or lumping us together here. But like as our generation of women designers really reach their power, there's this new kind of embrace of sensuality and your body and your freedom. And there's been a lot of clothes on the runways this season that like dance around the body, like a lot of really big swing skirts like at Sakai. I have a feeling we'll see more at Louis Vuitton. I had a preview of the Kiko Kastadenov collection and there's some really great like sort of like dresses in motion that are happening at that show. And I think like women just want to feel like sleek and empowered on the go. And part of that is like feeling a little hot, like the wind could flip up your skirt and you like show a great pair of underpants for like two seconds. And then you're like, oops. And your day goes on. It's true. Yeah, I'm going to Kiko. I'm going to a lot of shows tomorrow. Tomorrow has like like a hundred. How did the last day end up with the most shows is a real question. I'd like to ask the federal student. I'm not going to this Chateau Voltaire party. I'm going to go pack. I'm going to order some food from whatever that what's the website here. I don't know. See, this is why I'm in a hotel as I just have room service. I'm going to order from Deliveroo. I think that works here. One of those like weird delivery services and just pack because otherwise.

Shout out to your dad who walked in London. I don't want to do it comprehensive, but I do think we need to shout out that your dad was a model in a show in London. Yes, he was a model at the Chicovaluana show. He loved it. And he is interested in more booking. So if you're listening to this podcast and you need a white haired 75 year old model, please hit me up. It's going to happen. He looked great. He has a big head of hair. It's very fun. Yes. He had a lot of fun. It was very sweet. And also a very nice way to jumpstart Fashion Week is travel with your parents. It's so fun. That's so fun. So what have you seen on the streets here? That has really made you think about the way people are dressing right now. I was sort of amazed by how many people have leather jackets at the shows. I also bought a leather jacket this season, but it was crazy. Like everybody has a leather jacket. Yeah. Everybody wants this rounded shape sort of 80s leather jacket. Yesterday I ran into Julia Hobbs who was wearing a Louis Vuitton from Jonathan's first album. That's incredible. And then Cynthia Marege, who's the designer of Renaissance, made herself this incredible maroon leather cocoon jacket that she was wearing at an appointment yesterday. And I was like, you need to put this in the collection because it's just tough and gorgeous. And I actually think one of Leanna Satinstein's recent newsletters was about this like belted leather jacket that she's obsessed with. I mean, it's like that look is very much coming back right now. It's also like the tailwinds of the Phoebe look is like the cinched leather jacket. Yeah. I think it has a lot to do. I got the Oralee, like Blouson, just like classic bomber. So many people were like, is that Phoebe? And it's not, it doesn't look like anything she's done. It's much more classic. It really reminded me of the one the row did, but it was much more affordable and also lighter. The one the row did a couple of seasons ago, which I was like, if I don't have this, I've got to die. And then it was $7,000. But even if I got it on sale, apparently it was very heavy. And it was just especially for LA. But anyway, it was interesting to see all these people. And then also a lot of that really vintage heel shape. So I have the row did this Almond Toe Pump three or four seasons ago that I, the minute I saw it, I was like, that I was like, I will have this shoe. No matter what happens, the shoe is mine. And so I like didn't even, I didn't get it on a waitlist, but I literally went and bought it the day it was on sale. And I got it in, I have it in like taupe and black and it's been so great. But I've seen just so many more of that sort of like curvy heel Almond Toe just very vintage style pump. Yeah, definitely. I also think which Noah Johnson just published his column today. Is it about Evan Kenori? No, but it is about pants. It's about jeans being back. And I think that's really real. And obviously I've been seeing Mel Ottenberg around. Oh my God, I need his jeans. They look so good on everybody. But just like, I feel you'll read it and know as Colin, because he does a great job sort of explaining how like the winds are changing and jeans are becoming cool again. But it's like we spent so much time. Wait a second. What is Noah going to do because Evan Kenori doesn't make like a light jean? I know this was not addressed in the column. So we'll have to like DM him and find out what his like personal strategy is. I'm confused. I'm shocked he noticed. I did really like the Evan Kenori lookbook just went up. I think Noah posted it and it looked really good. And there was an outfit in there that I was like, oh, I would wear that. But I went to the store and tried stuff on it. Not if it looked right on me, but I like it a lot. I'm a big fan. I just think it's funny how much Noah loves it. Yeah, they're like besties. But I think, yeah, jeans are definitely having a comeback. I think, you know, I was kind of surprised. But I guess maybe this is the state of fashion six months ago. Like all of the collections were very commercial and basic to see at the Sakai show. And then later at Balenciaga, how many people and okay, including myself. And I also think you are just wearing like really great black jackets. And obviously, like I just bought another really great black jacket. But I think like people have been dressing a little bit more downbeat this season. Because there's so many shows and it's been raining in Paris. And, you know, I still think like the best people you see, the best dress people you see are the random people in Milan who are just going about their lives who have clothes from like an unknowable provenance and look chic and so that's it. And look chic and sophisticated and eclectic and weird. And I think maybe like that spirit of being yourself, wearing your life on your sleeve is what like makes the best shows this season the best. You know, like I'm really taken by Saint Laurent, which like the theme was if Saint Laurent, they were just going to make like the best clothes. I was like, okay, great. Like every single look is a banger. Yeah. So, you know, I think like personal styles really, it's really back. Dress however you want. Yeah, always. Wear whatever shapes jeans you want. Just do it. Yeah, it's interesting. I was, I wear my vintage Levi's a lot in LA and but I always bring them on these trips and I sometimes I'm like, is this too much for Paris? Like am I to LA with these jeans on? And you know, it used to be like no one wore black jeans in Paris also. Now I think they do more, but like five years ago it was like, you wear black jeans. These are just blue jeans, but it was funny. I saw this really cool woman at Cafe Charlotte because I still go there. I'm sorry, but she had on Phoebe sunglasses, a Loewe bomber and what was the thing she had a summer? She had the Phoebe bag and but she had vintage Levi's on and I was like, okay, that woman is cool. So I can still wear my vintage. But it is so true. You've got to just wear what you want. Let's do a rumor of the week really quickly. I think that we need to talk about Chanel because it is out of control. Can I just give you some of the insane, insane things people have said to me? Yes. Jonathan Anderson is going to Chanel. He's starting in January. Three people. Then someone else messaged me. He works at Chanel tells me this. Then, oh no, it's Peter Mule. Oh no, it's Nadej. Oh no. It maybe it's Julie De La Bron. Who would know? I mean, I think that was a joke, but because referring to our last conversation, then other people are like, they haven't, they've barely started looking. Then other people are like, it's, I mean, I think the Jacquemus thing, that's everybody's like, who knows? That rumor seemed to have run its course, although all that stuff about him setting up that team and meeting with them is, was 100%. Anyway, then it's like, well, what about Mark Jacobs? Well, what about this? Well, what about this? Well, what about this? Remember when Gabriella Hearst was a rumor? It's crazy. It's totally crazy. It's totally out of control. It's completely insane. I truly have no idea that I have people who are like pretty good and tight in that company who are saying it's an unknown woman. It's me. No. I mean, that would be amazing. I have no idea. Other people are like, you know, just remember this person has to be able to deal with all these like ateliers that they, they're pretty vertically integrated that they own. It can't just be a person who's like on the marketing side, but then other people are like, it can just be a person on the marketing side because the company runs so smoothly already. It's just such a mess. And one thing that I wrote on Monday's newsletter that I think is important is someone said they really should have figured this out before Carl Lagerfeld died. Like they should have tried to plan this. And I know that the previous CEO was trying to do that. And so, and one of the reasons that she left. It's just, it's a word of warning to all the companies where the creative director founder is like almost 100 years old. Just like start to think about it. I know it's hard and a lot of those people are like mentally and physically still really with it and they're not going anywhere for several years. But think about it. Like look at it's interesting that like Mewchaprada, she brought in her successor to work with for years. Like who knows what will happen when that's, and she's quite young compared to most of these people. But like, of course a woman took the high road and did the right thing for the company. And you think of someone like Donna Tulliver Sachi is still doing super well, but there's always talk that like they might bring in someone to be with her. And it seems like I truly don't know what's going on with that, but it seems like she's open. Like it's not like they, it's like Jill Sander, I mean she left three times and came back, but she left. Like it's so interesting. But what is after hearing about all this like chaos for the last week, what do you think? Where are you feeling right now? What do you want to happen? I believe in my heart that the answer has been in front of us all along in Sofia Coppola. Sofia is in Paris. She posted on Instagram that she went to an art gallery yesterday. So I'm on Sofia watch 2024. Maybe she's going to LV tomorrow or she's definitely going to Chanel. Definitely going to Chanel. Not LV. She's Marc Jacobs LV. I forgot. Yeah. I think after living through the rumor cycle of like every possible designer going to Chanel, I think like what would be really amazing is to see someone with really strong ideas. Like there's so many people that we talked about who are probably not going to Chanel, like Jonathan Anderson or Alessandro Michele or Heddy Slamaine or whoever. But I think you really need someone of that caliber of talent who is both able to manage all the vertically integrated ateliers and do the marketing and have a fashion show that blows people's socks off, whether it's like a film or a lookbook or a campaign or a party or whatever. Like Chanel is the ultimate fashion brand and it requires like the ultimate designer to helmet. It's really hard. I don't even know if we even mentioned a dutch, which I think is a rumor started because Kathy Horan wrote that she would love to see Nadezh do it last summer and it has spiraled. So I don't know. My personal feeling is, you know, they really want this person to be there for 20 years. They want this person to grow with the company is the company is changing. They have a new, a new CEO, you know, a lot of the people who have worked there for a long time are going to leave in the next couple of years. Like it's a changing of the guard in that way. I mean, someone like Jonathan Anderson actually makes a lot of sense. Like he could totally do it. He has the ability. He's only scratched the surface of his talent and range and he's in control and he's like this generation of designers is just so much more. Manage their lives better than the previous generation that were just so overworked. And I think he has that sort of ability to do a lot of things at once and do them super, super, super well. So he's an interesting person. I still think Eddie Salman is like would be amazing and really, really good at it. He's probably what is he? He's probably like close to 60 or 60. He might be a little younger than that. But the thing is, there just really aren't that many people. Like there's just not, he's 56. So like he could definitely work there for 20 more years. People are 86, 90 still working. And so that's possible. He's so young, but it depends on what they want the job to be. If they're thinking the job is just like the runway show, there's a lot of more options. A runway show and like the marketing. So like the thing that I keep coming back to is the supermarché. Like who's going to do the supermarché? Which did you go to that show? No, I didn't, but I have FOMO. I went and it was really hilarious. There's all these things of journalists stealing stuff. Like people who were not, who worked at like newspapers taking shit from the supermarché. I didn't take anything, which now I'm like, why didn't I? That was silly. But it was like, no, I can't take anything. I can't break rules. But like I should have taken a mat or something or like a box of cereal. Yeah, it's so dumb. Why didn't I do that? But anyway, there's like hilarious caught on tape of these idiots taking like running like supermarket sweep or something. But it was, it was really amazing. And then like the campaign that comes after that is just so fun. And so is it the person who can do that and really have fun with it? Or is it the person who can really keep it all the shit together and make it better, even better than it is right now. And also work in tandem with all these people because there are just so many people and they're not all going to retire tomorrow. So it's a real question. And I think as much as I had heard from so many people in Milan that like the decision was done and they were probably going to announce after the show, I think more and more like, why do that? Why rush it? Unless you're absolutely sure. And it doesn't also the answer may be right in front of our faces and we're just not seeing it. We're all going to be like, duh. You know? Yeah. I mean, I think what they probably, what I would love if they had is someone who made clothes that we would want to wear. You know, like the Chanel suit is the most iconic garment of the 20th century. Or, you know, one of the most iconic silhouettes of the 20th century. And I think it's like, can someone come in and do that for the 21st century is really the question at Chanel. It's like there's all this other stuff, but at the end of the day, the clothes to me really have to like move someone to be inspired and fabulous and chic and expensive. And so I think in that regard, there's a lot of options and hopefully they choose someone exciting and fun. Yeah. And you know who we never talk about because she would never do it, but it's Phoebe Fiello. Oh, totally. Actually, someone recently was like, the Olsons are going to go to the wedding. Yeah. It's, there's no way. Like if that happens, I might retire. Like it's just, it's so, it's so dumb. Like it's just such, just because the family office invested in them does not mean they are trying to build the next Chanel. Like, and I don't, I'm not being hyperbolic. Like that is literally what they think they want to build the next great fashion company. And if they are designing Chanel, they're not going to do that. So like, if that happens, I will be disappointed in everyone involved. But I do think Phoebe is, to me, Phoebe really is the Coco Chanel of her time. And like, she makes things that we all like so much of what she does. But what she's made will influence fashion forever. So it's, I don't think it's right for her. It doesn't seem like that would be good for her, but I wouldn't mind it. And you know, this is fun. And if it ends up being Sophia stuff, like we're going out to dinner. I will be hell yeah. We're opening a bottle of champagne. We're going to have Sophia take us out to dinner. Yeah. And we're going to drink Sophia sparkling rose. Yes. But also some other alcohol that actually gets me drunk. No, not some sparkling rose. Stuff we went way over than we normally do on Monday, but this was so fun. So much fun. I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow. I'm going to go to Kiko and are you going to Peter Doe? Yes. But you're not going to Disneyland. I am going to go to Disneyland. Oh, me too. I'll see you there on Space Mountain. I'm going to see you all day. I'm going to all that stuff tomorrow. So we'll hang. Well, thank you for having me back on the pot. I love chatting about fashion. I love you being here. It was so fun. Happy fashion month. And we'll talk soon. Yeah, see you soon. Fashion People is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck, hosted by Lauren Sherman.
