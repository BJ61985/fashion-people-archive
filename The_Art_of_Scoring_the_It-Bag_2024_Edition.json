I am really in it. I landed in New York on Tuesday. I hit up a bunch of events on Wednesday. I went to the Perenza Scholar Show on Wednesday. It was really beautiful and it's really great space. I'll have more on that probably on Monday and my fashion week kind of review type saying that I'll publish. But tonight, it's Thursday when I'm recording this. I'm heading to Ralph Lauren in a few hours in Bridge Hampton. And I'll also have on Monday my take on that. And we actually have three back-to-back issues this week. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Wednesday, Rachel did a great piece on celebrity beauty brands and which ones are actually successful. You'll be very surprised. She had all these great numbers. You should check it out. And then Thursday, I asked the question, who wants to buy New York Fashion Week? A lot of people, apparently. But what is it worth and why is Endeavor thinking about selling it? It's not formally for sale. That is what I will say. But I'm actually still reporting this as we're talking. But by the time you listen to this, it'll be out in the world. So let me know what you think or if you have any more intel on that. I also had a little bit about the row in Thursday's issue, some funding changes, some HR scoops, some updates, changes of Victoria's Secret on Wednesday. There's so much going on. Anyway, you should subscribe to Line Sheet if you haven't. And also check out that SMS channel. It should be up and running for French and English people very soon. Thank you all for reaching out who weren't able to access it. Americans, Canadians, you're all good. And it's been really fun texting with all of you. I had a really great time last night out and about. I was supposed to go to six things. I think I went to four. But the Harper's Bazaar party at Laval d'Or, which I definitely mispronounced. And people who keep sending me like, you're pronouncing this wrong. Thank you, but I don't care. It's not my thing. But anyway, it was really great. Love the restaurant. Very impressed with Samir Nasser and what she did there. And it was a fun party. I hope the Hearst people were happy. And because it seemed like all the brand people I talked to thought it was super fab. It's the sort of. Remaking of that restaurant is really great and kind of encapsulates what's happening in New York right now. So I had a great time. I'm going to try to go to a ton of stuff this weekend and Monday night while still reporting and writing. So wish me luck because it's not easy, but I'm having a lot of fun. And I hope to see you around. And as always, text, email, SMS, whatever, find me DM. I'm there for you. I hope you enjoy this interview with Gab. We recorded a few weeks ago, but it's a really good insight into what's happening in the market right now if you're confused, because I think a lot of people are. So enjoy. Talk soon. Gab Waller, welcome to Fashion People. Thank you. I am so excited to be here and to chat with you. So the first question we ask on Friday mornings is what did you have for breakfast? What did I have for breakfast? I had a smoothie. I have the same smoothie every single morning. And because I love a good routine, I've been having the same smoothie for about six years. I'm addicted to it. OK, what's in it? You need to tell us. So it's like a base of cacao powder. So it's like a chocolatey smoothie, but it's got avocado, banana, spinach, a date, college and powder. It's really good. I didn't drink coffee. So to me, it's I actually can't stop my mornings without my smoothie. Are you from Australia or New Zealand? I'm Australian. Are you friends with Kirsty Godso? I love Kirsty. I didn't know her when I was she's from New Zealand. I didn't know her from Brooklyn, but I met her goodness. I probably met her a couple of years ago here in LA and yeah, she's the sweetest. You know, one of my another Australian, not that you all know each other, but you do all sort of know each other that I'm good friends with is Laura O'Neill from Van Luen. Have you ever crossed paths with her at like one of the like Australians in American summits or anything? The name doesn't ring a bell, but it is funny because you're right. I feel as though there is this concept that all Australians do know each other. But there's a lot of us. I don't know Laura. Maybe it's someone I need to meet. I think you do. You should do a collaboration with her on ice cream. They just did a Hello Kitty collaboration. She's the founder of that. Yeah, she's one of the co-founders and she lives half time in most time in LA and a bit in New York still as well. The rest of the team is in New York, but she's out here. I didn't know that. I love her ice cream. So that's well amazing. We don't have. Delicious. So how did you get from Australia to Los Angeles? Yes. So to give you a good little background story. So I do fashion sourcing. I'm considered a fashion sorcerer and I started my company six years ago now. I just crazed it to think how how long I've been doing this. But I started it from Sydney and I realized pretty quickly on within the past of with sorry within the initial six months that the US was going to be a big market for me. And in Australia, there is I really feel there's there's a certain level that you can get to where it's like I can't really go any further than this without going overseas. And I felt that I I shit that within that like six to 12 month period. So it was just a natural progression for me to relocate over here. And I will say there are so many similarities between Los Angeles and Sydney. So LA was my number one choice. And it's been hold who in a bit years I moved here in September, 2021. OK, so let's start with what is you said you're a fashion sorcerer. Yeah. What is a fashion sorcerer? Amazing. I love this question. So it's really interesting when I first started this time, sourcing or source or wasn't an industry within fashion. It really did not exist. And we've had, you know, fashion stylists and of course, personal shopping and personal shoppers for a very long time. But the best way to describe a fashion source that is I source pieces by request. So I work on inbound requests only and I specialize in sourcing pieces that are sold out or are in very high demand. So the difference between say fashion sourcing and personal shopping is fashion sourcing is all inbound. It means the client knows exactly what they want. They don't need my advice. They just want that shoe or that bag. And it's my job to find them. Whereas on the flip side with personal shopping, it's flipped. It's usually the personal shopper will be making recommendations to their client. So I almost think it's fashion sourcing is it would sit under the umbrella of personal shopping, but I would not consider myself a personal shopper. OK, so what did you do before you became a fashion sourcer and how did you how did you get into it? Yeah, so I would say in my early to early twenties, because I started the business around like my mid twenties, but early twenties, I really did kind of dabble in every part of the fashion industry prior to getting into fashion. It almost feels like another lifetime, but I did work in the government. That's what I did pre like, sorry, post school and pre fashion. I was working for the state government and then I went into federal government. Is that like a typical thing people do in Australia? It's not. No. How did you end up in the government? I don't know. Can you talk about what you did? Yeah, so it's it's true. I really have to sometimes just be like, that's why I did that was me doing that. But I never went to college. I'd end that's one thing I will say in Australia, that concept of university or college, it's very different to America. So it's of course, you know, we do have our universities and our colleges there, but it's totally normal that a lot of people would go straight into working or would have their gap years. But straight out of high school, I didn't know what I wanted to do. And I certainly didn't think fashion was an option from me. I grew up in a very small town in Australia, so I was not exposed to, you know, fashion growing up or this kind of world. So at the time, I graduated high school and I was like, well, I need to get a job. And I got a little admin position working in the state government, just in like my little local office in my small town of Rockhampton. And I realized very quickly that I was like, OK, I am ambitious. I am going to be a career girl. Like I'm I want to climb my way up this ladder. Like this is this is the trajectory of my life. And so I set out doing that within the government. And I eventually relocated to the city, which was Brisbane, and then eventually to Canberra, which is where I was in the federal government. And I had a few different positions, but this is where it kind of gets a little bit funny is my last position before I moved into fashion. I was working in compliance. So I was essentially doing detective type work, where I was constantly having to find information in order to produce what we would we would consider warrants at the time. So in a funny way, I think I've always had that desire to find things and discover things and just like, you know, find the missing pieces of the puzzle. And it's in it's I always like think of it in a way it's like bizarre that I was doing that. And now I'm actually finding that shit. Amazing. That's so that's so interesting. It's bizarre. So how did you decide, oh, I'm going to do this? And you did you start your business on Instagram or did you have clients like around town? How did you actually get the business off the ground? Yeah. So in my early 20s, once I departed the government, I dabbled in different areas in the fashion industry. I landed on styling. I thought, you know, this is what comes what feels most natural to me. I feels very organic. I think I can do this, but I never really had that like extreme zest for it. I never really felt that like heart on fire moment for it. So I was on a trip to Los Angeles funnily enough. And that was kind of my epiphany moment of, wow, they have so much stock here that I wonder if there's a way of getting it to Australia and offering it to the Australian market who doesn't get much. And if we do get something, we tend to get it much later than everyone else. And so that was my epiphany moment. But when I went back to Australia, I spent about six months doing, you know, market research and, you know, who would be my client in Australia? I did not come from like a, you know, I wasn't a VIP client at these brands. So I really was starting from scratch on every angle. But I started the Instagram and still to this day is a very Instagram focused business. But I started the Instagram and the best thing about Australia, in particular, Sydney, I will say is that everyone is very supportive of one another. And it's such a it is a small market. So once I was in the circle of like a number of clients that I knew would be fantastic clients for myself, my name really spread. And it was like a very much a word of mouth approach for the first six months and still to this day. And so what was your first post? Were you just like, I have, I don't know what the very cool thing was in 2018. But were you just like, I found this thing everybody wants and you hashtagged it. And someone bought it from you. Like how did what was the first thing you you listed? Yes. So there's two parts of this. I vividly remember my first post. It was the Dior Obligue Settlebag. This was when they had just brought them back and it was like, it was a thing. Everyone wanted that to your oblige saddlebag. So I vividly this was 2018. It would be maybe, which April, April, May, June of 2018. That was my first post. I very vividly remember sourcing that for one client in Sydney. But at the time I was kind of keeping my eye on Facebook groups. There was a number of like Facebook fashion groups in Australia. And there was this one girl that posted desperately looking for the Balenciaga triple S sneakers. This was when they were so hard to get. And that was my first West. I remember being like, I need to prove myself to this client. And she was my first client. Her name's Holly. And it goes to the point of like, I think I ended up getting her like three different sizes because I was so damn desperate to just prove myself and be like, hey, I can get these. But yeah, it was the triple S sneakers. And how quickly like did it pick up? How fast were you kind of able to make a decent annual salary off of it? Yeah. So when I launched, I was still working full time. And because I did not want to allow like to allow any kind of conflict of interest, my second passion outside of fashion is interior design and any kind of thing relating to furniture. So I was working full time in this like furniture concept store. And I I would say within three months, I knew that I had enough to at least support myself and not like make a huge profit per se, but I knew that I had enough to support myself. So it was within three months that I resigned from my full time position and went out to be like, I'm doing this on my own. And at that time, I still had a roommate. I mean, my expenses were very, very, my overheads were very, very low. But I think it was within then for eight months that I've got my first office and then kind of really went out and be like, this is this is happening. How do you make money? How does it work? What? So my business model is for that rate sourcing fee. So there's two ways to do this kind of business. You everything's based off like because we are a service based business. So we only get paid when we provide those services. So there's you can do a flat rate fee, which is what I do. And I like to keep it very low. And I'm happy to say it's 220 USD for any item, no matter what it is. And then the other option is percentage. So it kind of varies, I think anywhere between five to 10 percent, maybe the going rate. But I opted from day one to go flat rate because I'm focused on quantity. I want clients to come back to me for everything and anything. And we certainly have a lot of clients that are putting in requests daily, weekly and certainly monthly. And I like being transparent, like that's the flat rate. It's not going to be based off the item cost or anything like that. It's just very transparent. So that's how we make money. And that's how we've been able to grow the business. It really is a very high quantity business. So it's a volume play, whereas some sources would do, OK, we're going to do a five or 10 percent and maybe not have as many clients. But like it's like that that veers that probably that approach. You're more of a personal shopper. You end up doing more personal shopping type stuff. That's exactly right. Yeah, it certainly is volume based because that's that's the thing on the flip side. If you do decide to go through the percentage option, yes, you may make more money per sale, but you would be certainly transacting less orders.

Explain to us how sort of the business works from the customer side. But from the brand side, like how did you build relationships with the stores? Do you have direct relationships with the brands? How do you operate? How do you get this product other than, I mean, we all know that what you put in, you get out. So like, obviously you're doing a lot of legwork. But how did you build up relationships with brands and how does that side of it work? Yeah, I will say six years ago was definitely a very different space. And I think because this concept of fashion sourcing didn't exist at the time, I will say it was much easier to establish those relationships back then. And I felt the brands were a lot more accommodating. And again, they perhaps saw us as a personal shopper slash stylist. And I think that's how like that was that certainly the advantage of starting very early on. And I think being able to develop those relationships early on. And it really does vary so much between each brand, some brands, the relationship maybe with the PR. And that's how I'm being able to source and obtain the pieces that I am. Whereas some brands, it may be purely just as like the store director level. And that's how they're pulling pieces from all over the like all over that region. But the biggest thing is it really is having eyes and ears globally because there's only so much I can do within say the US. But the real pull is having relationships globally because I need to be able to obtain the stock in say Paris or Dubai or of course Australia. So the biggest thing is those international relationships. And I think it's just over time, I've been able to establish those more and of course true as my perhaps my reputation and the business has grown. It has been easier for these brands to look at me and be like, OK, she's worth my while because in the early days again, I didn't I didn't have any relationships. I didn't even own a Chanel bag. I I wasn't a VIP shopper. So it was very much like just having to prove myself to be like, I am worth your time. I will I have clients I can make you sales. And then from there, it's just grown quite organically. So are there any brands where they have a sort of database of because the interesting thing about a lot of these luxury brands from a retail perspective is sometimes the stock online and the stock offline doesn't match or they don't have like you can't see where something's available. Most of them I'd say their customer management systems. Relationship systems, CRMs, what is it called like customer relationship management or something? Those systems are now much better than they were, you know, when you started for sure. Is it essentially like you kind of have to have relationships with the store directors on top of or are there any brands where you can just call and say, do you all have this? Can you look in the inventory database? Yeah, I would say that I realized pretty early on that a lot of the regions don't speak to each other. There's no kind of their systems aren't connected. I'm not exactly sure of that back end system with the the brands, but it is. They may say, OK, I can see it showing in XYZ so I can see it showing in Dubai. But I can't we can't pull it for you. So that's why for me it's been really important to not only establish relationships globally, but establish my team. So at present, I have about 10 sourcing assistants around the globe and they are physically on the ground. They are liaising with our contact person in that region and they're also physically collecting the item, physically dispatching the item because, yeah, some brands, although they may have visibility of another region's stock, they don't have the ability to pull it and do like an international transfer. Got it. And also, it's that thing of like, like I was at the product store in Milan in June and I tried this dress on and the woman was like, be a be a treacher. I think that's what her name was. I think that's how you say it in Italian. It looked like Beatrice, she was awesome. We loved her. She was like, oh, this is on hold for a client and they like had put 50% down. So she had to call the person and I ended up getting the dress. But so much of it like, they're holding stuff for their top clients too. So I wonder if a lot of that stuff, it's in the system, but like only halfway type thing. That's it. And that's exactly it. It's a lot of that because also that the stock these days, especially some of the stock that I'm sourcing, it never even hits the floor. It's either pre-reserved or like I said, deposit paid and on hold behind closed stores or whatever it may be. It's some of these pieces that we're dealing with. They never make it onto the flux store. Yeah. Okay. So I have one more question about how you manage your business. And then let's talk about the consumer and consumer trends and behavior because I feel like you're on the ground for that stuff. But one more thing is when did you hire your first employee and like how big is your team at this point? And how do you train people to do this kind of work? Yeah. So I, if I could say one mistake I perhaps made in business is I waited a little too long to make my first hire. And I think that was perhaps out of fear. And this is my baby and just letting go of the robust was very early. Sorry, very hard for me in those early days. So looking back, I definitely would have hired much sooner. But I vividly remember my first hire was in December 2019. That's in terms of like in-house hire. Prior to that, I did have my, a couple of sourcing assistants globally, but in-house like physically assisting me with DMs and the logistics of the business. That was in December 2019. So I did go like a whole year and a half-ish just harrowing at it on my own. So yeah, that was my first hire. And then in terms of training the team, that's a good question. I would say in a way I feel like I do have a really good sense of exactly who I'm looking for and, you know, finding the right person for this, the internal team. My thing to me, the biggest thing is like we are just like a communication-based business. So anyone that's kind of coming in, like we are known for our service and the service that we provide to our clients. So I want every part of the business to really like scream that essentially. So I'm looking for, you know, the great communication skills that genuinely, genuinely want to help people because of course we are also in a people-based business. So that's something that I don't think you can necessarily train on. You have to have a genuine desire to help people and want to help people to want to do this type of work. And how is your team kind of spread across the world? Yes. So I have one full-time team member here in Los Angeles with myself. He is more operations. He's back-of-house logistics, managing all that type of thing. And then I have a general manager in Australia. So she is really basically my right hand. She's doing, you know, everything that I would potentially be doing. And she is fantastic. I, yeah, truly, truly brilliant. So they're my two full-timers. And then I have my 10-sourcing assistants basically globally. So they're on the ground. I can list the countries if you like, but they're on the ground. They're picking things up, shipping things out. And then most recently, I have two content creators that are assisting between Instagram and TikTok. Amazing. What's the easiest way if there are people listening to this who actually want to use your service immediately? What's the easiest way to use it? Is it just DMing you? I feel like maybe I filled out a form once or I might be making that up in my head. Was there a form at some point or? There is no form at present. I, DM is the way. DMs, it is always the best. And for me, the reason for that is I want to meet the client where they are. They are on Instagram already. So the fact that they just have to DM us with an image and their size, like, I want to make it as quick and easy as possible. The only alternative to that is, of course, not everyone has social media. So we also do accept requests by email and we can begin the hunt for them. Got it. And I'm sure it also helps with if you see their Instagram, the kind of stuff they're into, because I assume that sometimes you do get tipped off of things. And so if you think someone would be into something, you could say, oh, I heard that like the mu mu flip flop. We have that in red somewhere and it looks like something you'd like or what have you. Exactly. I'm actually so glad you said that because that is another reason why I have kept the business on Instagram is it is so personal. I love the fact that I can, yes, click on the client's profile and get a feel for their style and everything like that so that it helps create that personal relationship. Quicker than if it was by email where it's like, I don't know. I'm such a visual person. I love having a face to a name immediately so I know who I'm speaking to. And Instagram really does. I think it creates that personal relationships, you know, tenfold quicker as opposed to perhaps email or like a web form or anything like that. Totally. This show is brought to you by Boca.

Over the years, you've been doing this for six years. What has been, and I remember that Dior saddlebag because I'm assuming that was the time when the internet was flooded with that influencer campaign that they did. Shout out to my friend, Gary, who organized that. It was really amazing. But throughout the years, I want to talk soon about what they're into right now. But what has been the craziest thing where people are driving you nuts and you're just spending your whole life trying to find this item? It's a great question. It's so interesting because there have been a number of pieces over the years that have created exactly that. I call it a wave. It's this massive increase of requests. And then I will say within a couple of months, it certainly dies down. I would say that one that has remained pretty consistent is Chanel. So Chanel is definitely one of my most requested brands. But they're dad sandals. Like this is going back to OG days. Like that was a style that I could not keep up with. It was constant. This was maybe 2019, 2020. Any time I got a Chanel dad sandal, it would immediately sell. But if we're speaking more to the present, one style that I cannot keep up with and I'm actually very surprised by because I did not see this coming is Mimiu has this crochet multi-color pouch bag. And it's actually from last summer. So it was released. It came out. It had some casual sales that it did eventually sell out. And then that's when it really started to create this influx of like, OK, there's a lot of interest on this product and they've released it again for this summer. And naturally it is now completely sold out. But I'm talking like I will get multiple requests for that bag a day. And I do think the reason for that is it is what I would consider in this current time a reasonably priced bag. We've also seen the price increases, which don't seem to be slowing down. And this Mimiu pouch, I believe it retails for around like 800, which. Oh, wow. Yeah. That sounds like 50 bucks at this point. That's what I mean. We just crazy to save it. Yes, that's exactly it. It's a well-priced bag. Interesting. So how has the consumer changed in the last couple of years? Because you went through, you started in 2018 when things were still really on the upswing. 2019, I remember feeling like we were just on this hamster wheel. We were never going to get off. 2020 crash. But 2020 to 2024 essentially was like people were just going nuts spending and things seem to, at least from the numbers that I read in the financial reports have slowed down a bit. But what has the trajectory of the consumer been since you started and what are they feeling? What is your feedback from them telling you? I would say one thing that I've noticed tremendously is in the early days, it was very much that we would refer to as like logo mania. Like it was very logo heavy. Everyone wanted the pieces that visibly had, you know, a Louis Vuitton logo on it or wasn't even a Mimiu logo then because like Mimiu is a whole different conversation to be had. But it was logo heavy and I would say fast forward to now and within the past year or so, it's completely opposite. Clients do not want the logo crazy pieces and it's much more about that. Like the row and Kate and these brands that 2018, 2019, I don't think I got a single the row request. Like it's not what the consumer wanted at that time, but it's just the switch has been made and it's much more that I don't want to say the word quite luxury. I'm not going to sport, but it's much more just understated and all that like investment dressing pieces that will have longevity to them. Except for Mimiu though, right? Like what how do you explain the phenomenon? Their earnings came out with this. This is going to run in a couple of weeks, but the day that we're recording this, their earnings came out and like Mimiu's sales once again increased by 50%. It eventually will slow down people. Everyone needs to chill out. It can't go on like this forever. But like what would you attribute that being okay with the logos with Mimiu versus other brands? Yeah, such a great question. I saw that this morning too and I'm like, I'm not surprised. It's doing so well, especially for us. We can't keep up with the Mimiu request. I would say like they just know their customer, they know their consumers so well and they design for that Mimiu girl. They have such a clear vision of who she is. And I feel even I think I'm a great example of that because I would consider myself like I Mimiu is by far probably one of my most favorite brands. And I'm drawn to just the aesthetic of that girl. Like I want to be a part of that brand because everything they design, it's just like it's me until I see myself as dressing. So I feel they just know their consumers so well. They know their clients so well and they're also designing cool pieces. Like the Mimiu person is very, very cool. And so, you know, we've seen everyone and it attracts such a wide range of clients because they might see the influencer wearing it. And it's like, okay, cool. I want to be that girl. And so that attracts like the younger consumer. And to me, it spreads so wide, but I get it. I really do get why it's selling so well. What about Prada? It doesn't have the same because I always say like I love me. I love the Mimiu. So I don't think I'd wear, but I actually have like an Intarja Prada sweater. I have more stuff with Prada on it than I'm still like not, I'm not going to be getting the triangle shoes. But I bought jeans with a little triangle and I have like, you know, so is Prada still hitting but maybe not as wild and crazy as Mimiu? Is that the instinct? That's it. I definitely feel it is hitting. But and I think like you said, like that little triangle, perhaps more subtle, but I would say it might be hitting in a different way. Whereas I feel Mimiu, it's across all categories. Like the Mimiu bags, the ready to wear the shoes, like it's, it pulls you in on every direction. Whereas I feel for Prada, I don't really get that many requests for, say, their bags, but they're ready to wear pieces. I do. So I think it's more like the, which categories they're hitting and Mimiu is hitting all categories. That makes sense. I assume that you mentioned Chanel is sort of across the board. I assume that like the way Chanel does its logo stuff, that logo is always OK. It is, yes. It is. Everyone loves the CC. I feel that it's definitely perhaps gone. But like I'm seeing not as much like CC all over the place, but something is there's a cardigan right now that Chanel has released. And it's just got those little CC buttons and everyone loves it. So that to me is like the logo that's like standing the test of time. Everyone loves it. Do your clients like even know that Virginie VR doesn't work there anymore? That's a good question. I, I'm actually going to say yes. I do. I will say that I feel as though my clients are very, I can they, they are partly passionate about fashion. They know what they want. They do their digging there. They don't come to me as like a first resort. I think they do do their own work on their end. So I think they know kind of what's going on and what's happening in fashion and what pieces to how much like they would certainly know about like who is the creative director at the time. I'm not sure, but I would definitely say my clients are. They're, they're on top of it. Like they know what's going on. Where do they get their information? Is it mostly from Instagram and TikTok or do they read sub stacks? Do they ever message you with like a picture from a magazine? Like where are they finding out about stuff? This part I love so much because I find it's so fascinating to track. Where is this coming from? Like you said, is it TikTok, Instagram? It's, it's fascinating to me, but I would say at present, TikTok has a huge pull. The amount of screenshots that I will get from TikTok is definitely increasing and has increased over the past a year or so. And it could be from anyone. It's whether it's like an unboxing TikTok or it's like the girl walking down the street and she's doing an interview like that screenshot that. So I would say I've seen a huge increase in TikTok screenshots. Instagram, I wouldn't say as much. I'm like, like trying to envision right now, requested them coming over the past 24 hours. But I think also the biggest one that I do get is again, this kind of shows how savvy my clients are that they are doing their own search for coming to me. But it's usually a screenshot from a website and it says sold out. So they try to look for it themselves or it might be like a screenshot between them and the essay and it's like, essay says like, no, it's gone. And so they've sent that to me being like, I'm being told it's gone. Can you find it? So there's, there's certainly doing the digging on there. And but I would say majority of the time it's, it's like from a multibrain that they've tried to look for themselves. How many clients are you juggling at a time? Like on average? I would say that it really is so varied because and one thing I will say is we would never at least, you know, touch wood and I like, I feel very confident in saying this. I would never get to a position where I'm like, no more clients. We can't take it because the way our business works is we have a lot of clients that just come in for that one specific item. They get it and then we don't hear from them for another six to 12 months, potentially even longer. So it's hard to say like how many we're juggling at one given time. But in terms of requests that we receive every day, it's, it's between like 40 to 50 minimum. And it can go up to like 100 on like a crazy day. So it's hard to say how many we're juggling because it all happens to the DM and and it's also quite a quick exchange. It's not a, and I guess that's also the separation between that personal shopper and that stylist is it's a quick exchange of like, here's what I want. Here's a picture. Here's my size. Can you find it? And then like communication would be like, we're on it. We're going to log this, let's do what we can do. And then we don't circle back until it has been found. So it's more about how many conversations we're juggling at any given time. And that can be in the hundreds on any given day. You know, it's interesting because I'm sure your business is growing each year because it's becoming better known and it started out small. It wasn't like you had an established business before 2018. So I wonder if it's hard for you to see this because you're going to grow no matter what at this, at this stage of the business. But have you noticed the last year, like a drop off from certain regions or like the request coming from different areas of the world? Because again, like I'm looking at the financial reports and I see nobody's shopping in China, everybody's shopping in Japan or whatever. Like, can you kind of suss out those trends from the trend you see in the consumer behavior or the area the requests are coming from or the types of things or the cost of the things, all of that? Yeah. So I will say the US is definitely still my biggest market. It has been for several years and I have not noticed any changes here. But I will full transparency say that I have noticed a dip in my second biggest region, which is Australia. And I feel the consumer behavior has definitely changed down there. And I think based on just conversations I've had to, I do think the media down there is kind of scaring Australians with what they're reporting on. And it's different to what is happening here, I feel. But in Australia, it's of course like the whole talk is about interest rates and recession and everything like that. And I think it's scaring the consumer a little bit. And I'm sure perhaps some people are feeling it, but Australia is one of the regions where I have noticed, unfortunately, a dip. Is Australia a less consumption driven culture? I've only been there once and during the holidays where everything was closed for a month. But is it less because like Western culture, American culture in particular is so like our GDP is just so driven by consumption. Yeah. Like the idea, it's interesting, someone DM me once at the top of the Monday show, I usually ask the guests what they bought this weekend. And someone was like very repulsed that I had asked someone that I was like, look, I mean, this is what we do. This is the culture. But would you say there is just like a baseline difference in the way people consume their versus here? It is true. I would say that for sure. It is very different. And I think that perhaps took me a little because I'm from Australia, I grew up there. So perhaps I didn't see that straight away in the early days. But I can say that now. And with that said, like I certainly there is a very strong luxury clientele market in Australia. But you're right, then they're not so much driven by that. I think they come nowhere to pull back. And I will say also, you know, Australia, we we are so far away from the rest of the world. So a lot of clients kind of like Europe, the European holidays and like the some holidays are a huge thing. So naturally, over the past few months, like a lot of my Australian clients have been traveling. And so of course, while they're in Europe and everything, they're getting those pieces. But yeah, you do raise a good point and I definitely would agree with that. So final question. What is next? Like what are people starting? What are you seeing in the market? What are your predictions? Like what are people starting to ask you about or or maybe stuff you just like have seen or you know is coming from looking at the runways that you think is going to be like the next big thing? Or like what are your predictions for for what people are going to start buying into in the fall? Yeah, this is exciting. So yes, lots of good things to come. I think my focus right now is certainly on fall eyes being, you know, very much laser focused on summer over the past few months. But we're going to see a shift definitely within the next month or so moving into that. I would say in terms of brands, I see Mimi continuing to do so well. I'm very excited to kind of see the trajectory there. I'm also really excited for Chloe. I know that you spoke about them. I love your newsletter. I'm going to pop that in right now that I'm obsessed with your newsletter and reading that when it comes out. But I know you were speaking about that this week. So I'm really excited for what's to come there. And another one that's, you know, high up on my radar is doing very, very well. It's continuing to do so well is a liar. So I think like their fall collection will be very strong. So that should be interesting. And anything else I want to pop in there? Hmm. Nothing else for now other than like, of course, it's going to be a lot of the row, which I'm not surprised by at this point. Yeah, the row can do no wrong. One thing I just learned about them is that they switch up their shoe designer every few years to, I think the last shoe designer may have gotten poached, but that's I can't, I can't report that officially, but they switch up the shoe designer every few years to keep things interesting. And so it doesn't feel too stale. And I think it's really smart because I end up buying a new silhouette from them. And then they repeat old ones too. Like you can always get that Teva sandal interpretation. But it's interesting about Chloe in particular, because as you meant, thank you for plugging line sheet at puck. Everyone should subscribe. It's puck.new slash fashion people to get a little discount. But you, it's in, you mentioned the other day I had in in line sheet about Chloe and I had just a couple of my friends who are fashion editors had worked sort of sharing links of they have a very cute, like dainty, healed clog and then another and a pair of platform, platform sandals. And it just feels like I, I wasn't sure. Like I really liked the first collection I thought was beautiful. I actually went to see it in the showroom and it looked good in the showroom. It was very busy, but I was still like, is this stuff like differentiate? It's very expensive. Is it differentiated enough? And the Met Gala, it was like whatever. But then this last, these last couple months as the product started to hit stores and I think they've done a really good job dressing celebrities with Danny Michelle, um, dressing Daisy Agar Jones. It's interesting to see that. And it does feel like the stuff's pretty and looks good. And, and it, it must be fun for you to get those requests for, cause it does feel new and different from what else is out there. I agree. I 100% agree. That to me makes me very excited because, you know, I will say like, I probably over the years, gosh, not that many Chloe requests at all. So to suddenly be seeing traction there, it gives me like a good sense of excitement. And I will agree that the prices are on the higher side, especially for they're ready to wear, but I am still getting ready to wear a request and it is selling out. I am seeing sold out on some sizes. So it's going to be interesting. It's going to be a good one to watch. See, people still have money, right, Gab? They definitely do. There is money going around. This was so fun. Thank you for joining me. Well, thank you so much for having me. Fashion People is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck, hosted by Lauren Sherman. That's me.
