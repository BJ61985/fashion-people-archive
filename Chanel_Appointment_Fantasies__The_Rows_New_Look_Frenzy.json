And today with me on the show, I've got Steph Yacca, head of content at Essence. We're talking couture, Peter Copping's new job. Plus we answer the question, are you going to look dumb if you wear a skirt over your pants? And of course, we'll finish things off with the rumor of the week. Let's get started. Hi, everybody. I am back in Los Angeles. I landed on Saturday and realized I was up for over 24 hours but somehow made it through and I've slept like a baby the last two nights. It feels good to be at home and back in my sweatshirts and jeans. But I had a great time in Milan and Paris with Liz Goff, our chief operating officer and co-founder and it was great to meet with brands and talk more about Puck. What we're doing and beyond Line Sheet, of course, I know you all read that. But it was a great time, really interesting experience. On Monday's newsletter, I decided to take a look at caring and the state of its restructuring one year in. It was about a year ago that Marco Bazzari, the CEO of Gucci left and there was reorganization there that Francesca Valentini, the San Laurent CEO was promoted to deputy CEO of the group. More recently, Laurent Clacquann, who was the president of Caring Americas, was moved into a chief brand officer role. He's moving to Paris for that. There's been a lot of movement and I see it as a way for Francois-Henri Pino to set up his business so that when he's ready to not be the CEO anymore, there is an organization in place. Not like LVMH where there are five kids chomping at the bit. One of his sons, Francois, does work at the business but is quite young and who knows? I haven't looked into any family succession conversation there. I think also remember that Francois-Henri is the second generation, not the first. It's just a different situation. Caring's in a very interesting spot. It's lost a lot of its value on the market and there's a lot of work to be done. It's much smaller business because the brands are fashion-driven for the most part. It's much more if the consumer changes its mind about something, it's much more affected than LVMH. LVMH can hide behind Sephora or behind travel or behind alcohol or if alcohol is not doing well, it can hide behind fine jewelry. It's just a much more diversified portfolio and Caring has spent the last decade, the last 20 years actually pruning its portfolio to be pure fashion and luxury. It's an interesting moment for that group which is really the only remaining true competitor to LVMH and even that I'd say the industry is just bifurcating into two things. One is LVMH and the other is everything else. It was fun to look into it and do some analysis on what's happening there. I also wanted to mention the Jill Biden Vogue cover. I don't mention it on the podcast because Steph used to work for Vogue and not everybody who used to work at Cond√© Nast likes to get into it like I do and just didn't think, I didn't want to put her in that position but I think it's important to address. The cover itself is really lovely. I thought it was nicely lit and shot and she looks beautiful and she wore classic American brands in white and navy. She wears Ralph Lauren. She wears Coach. She wears Michael Kors and then she also wore Irene New Earth earrings which was very fun and Irene New Earth is an LA based jewelry brand that she had a relationship with Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris has worn her jewelry long before she was vice president and so it's interesting that they both wear Irene and she's like the go-to jeweler of this administration because she represents the future and it's a pretty new brand whereas everything else Jill was wearing was super established. Whatever, honestly none of this matters because what really needs to happen or what many people in the Democratic Party feel needs to happen is that President Biden needs to step aside and let someone else run against Trump in November. All of this and her hopeful forward thinking reason for doing this Vogue cover is cast aside because of what happened last week. I don't think it's going to be very impactful as I wrote in Line Sheet. I really think the only thing that they could do to make this work is Anna Wintour needs to say, President Biden you got to step down or step aside or whatever you want to call it. In the past the fact that Vogue started endorsing candidates was a pretty big deal but now the impact of that is very small. It would really have to be Anna Wintour herself going out and saying we need change. She's a big fundraiser in the Democratic Party and she does have influence. So that's what I'd have to say about that. I hope you enjoy my conversation with Steph. We've known each other for I don't know 15 years and she started out as my intern. So we talk about that a little bit and I love talking about fashion with her so I hope you enjoy it. Steph Yatka, welcome to Fashion People. Thank you so much for having me. I'm so excited to talk about fashion with you. It's going to be fun. So when did you get back from Europe? Saturday evening, so the 29th. Are you feeling better? Your jet lag is done? No, I've been up since 3 a.m. So I'm going to try to keep it together for this podcast and then honestly maybe take a little nap. We were texting and you mentioned that you went to bed at 7 p.m. I went to bed at roughly because I also got back on the 29th. I went to bed at roughly 8.15. I was watching the Bratz documentary. I've been watching America's Sweethearts which is the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader Docuseries on Netflix. Oh yes, a friend of mine mentioned this on her podcast. She said it's really depressing but good. Yeah, I agree. It's a little scary. It's a little funny. It's a little heartwarming. But it does the antidote of after seeing 100 fashion shows and talking to 1,000 fashion people just watching something that's so different I think is essential. Yes, I would say that Bratz equally. I was actually texting with Lea Chernickoff, the executive editor of Harper's Bazaar, who we both have worked with and know very well. But I was live blogging my Bratz experience with her and then I fell asleep and she was still awake when I woke up because she stays up way too late. But the one thing that Andrew McCarthy, the quote unquote director of Bratz and one of the members of the Brat Pack has in common with fashion people is that he is totally unaware of himself in any way. He has no self-awareness. What did you think about the shows? I know you went to Men's Ancouture but this last week, what was your big picture takeaway? The couture shows are really the freshest in my mind. I think I'm really interested in the conversation that seems to have sparked up online around the Balenciaga show. I think people were really annoyed maybe that there was a lot of casual clothes in it. To me, it feels like that is the most interesting aspect of couture is how do you make something that's beautiful and luxurious but also useful? There's only so many gowns you can wear, let alone see, across seven days. I thought that show felt really energizing in that there's a desire to establish a way of dressing that feels realistic but still expensive. Yeah, and special because the reality of our lives are that most people wear sweatpants or leggings or whatever every single day. Or jeans. Or jeans. And that's kind of dressed up. And I thought at Tom Brown also, I guess these weren't in the show but I posted a picture yesterday because it just came up when I was looking through my phone of these little lace-up sneakers. I guess you could call them Peds but you also can call socks Peds so I'm not exactly sure. Plimsoils or whatever, little Ked style sneakers that Tom Brown had done and the guy whose photo I took, you could see the band-aids on the back of his feet which I thought was funny. But the point being that like, and I thought the Tom Brown show, I only went to a couple shows and you were there too, right? It was just like, it was grounded in a certain reality and we think of couture as being the dream but the reality of couture was that it used to be the reality. So you can dream in different ways and yeah, I thought that the discourse around Demna and Valenciaga in particular was, it's not surprising. I mean, of course people are going to be mad that they see jeans but Pier Palo did something similar a few years ago, right? Yes. At Valentino. I feel like that is really what the couture week was missing was like the Pier Palo effect which is he always had great day wear in the Valentino collections and I think 80% of the couture shows are just evening and you're kind of like, you really do get gown fatigue so I thought it was really refreshing to see what does a couture hoodie look like, what does a couture polo look like, what does a couture flannel look like and obviously Valenciaga is a little bit more conceptual and grungy and it felt very close to like Demna's personal style but just this morning I was looking at the Julie de Lebron look book which I wasn't there but I thought that was so fab. It's like, it's couture but it's great dresses like easy separates of gorgeous white bridal calf tan look. That sort of stuff feels more interesting to me than just costume. Really like I live for like the very dramatic Tom Brown things that are like so extreme but like your jaws on the floor, you know, like the level of craftsmanship is incredible but I think fashion is really looking for a way to dress now. You know, like there, what is the predominant trend for how normal people can dress every day like no one seems to know what the answer is and so I sort of prefer watching designers work that out on the runway rather than maybe just doing only fantasy, you know. I agree and I think Demna's sort of mission at Valenciaga at this point is and always his mission as a designer is to sort of move the conversation forward and kind of rewinding back to remember at St. Laurent when Hedy Salamon did a cashmere flannel shirt and everybody was so appalled and now that's super commonplace. Brad Pitt has a line of cashmere where he does cashmere flannel shirts all the time but thinking about how Demna approaches fashion and how do you move the conversation forward and the interesting thing about Valenciaga right now is it's doing really well within that group within carrying it's performing maybe better than they don't break out their individual numbers but it's performing really well the bags are doing really well everybody wants a motorcycle bag again and so he has an opportunity to annoy people a little bit and that's sort of what he does well other than making clothes that people really like to wear he's able to annoy people in a productive way. So I agree and I think Julie de la Bron is really great and I'm glad that she uses couture as her platform in the same way Peter and Alaya who didn't show this season is showing in New York because Alaya never showed on the schedule but the point being like it's not just about the fact that this stuff is custom made or made to measure in most cases it's about it feeling special and that's what normal people quote unquote want right now is to feel special.

Speaking of feeling special you and I actually had a conversation at Sakai that I ended up sort of using in in luncheering about this thing that happened last week where the Rose lookbook got released and Brian Malloy the Rose stylist is like the best. I just I love everything he does but he did a sort of it looked almost like what's the New York Mag column where they photograph people on the street with the white backdrop. Yeah I think it's just called the lookbook. The lookbookers. Yeah when he did the whole row lookbook for this season and I think it's they call it spring 2025 whatever that means they don't use their traditional names but I think they had done a similar thing for spring 2024 and it was essentially like really styled the way street style looks but it's all the the rose products and the first image that someone sent me and was just like going around the internet was this picture of a model and a pair of I think they're corduroy's they were definitely boot cut flip flops that I really want those flip flops even though I hate flip flops a lace dress and a cashmere like pull over gray sweater and the internet just like exploded with talk of skirt over pants and you were saying that like I mean you travel way more than I do you go to every single fashion week you go to market week you're out and about in the world this is just like the way people have been dressed young people have been dressing for a couple years right. Yes to me the skirts over pants has been happening since 2022 or earlier you know you can see people walking around Paris walking around New York walking around well I guess driving around LA if you know where to drive wearing these kind of like layering pieces you know I really think like in an effort to find a new silhouette or something that feels 2024 and doesn't feel 2004 or 1994 you know young people have really been experimenting with how they wear their clothes and to me like skirt over pant or slip over pant has been happening for a long time so I see why the conversation once the row uses it in a lookbook becomes suddenly like it's a thing but I think if you go back through like street style pictures from two years ago you can sort of really track the trickle up effect of this yeah which is maybe another reason why people are infuriated by it or obsessed with it it's sort of similar to what Demna does it's like the row is paying attention to how people dress or how people look or how people carry their bag or wear their towel or go to the pool or get on an airplane and so you are sort of looking through this twisted mirror back at contemporary style and I think that really like gets people excited or really irks people because they're like what this isn't fashion you know it's like it's jeans but to me I'm like so good yeah it's very reductive so it's interesting if you really try to trace this trend someone DM me and they were like this goes back to junior and I don't know in the 80s or the 90s but if you think about it that way and then you think about like tennis and sports which have also kind of are connected to this and the brand High Sport has been doing like a mini skirt with pants for a while but you don't think of it I think the reason this lookbook triggered people was because Ashley and Mary Kate Olson who really prefer to be referred to in that order yeah we IT's that you know I love you but they wore this trend when they were like how old are they they're they're like three or four years younger than me or five years younger than me they're probably in there I think they're 37 or 38 or something when they were in their early 20s in the 2000s and if you look at the way I mean people document their street style online in an insane way if you look at the way they're dressing right now it does sort of harken back to the way they dressed in that era and I would say for me I'm the same way like I bought a couple years ago a pair of boot cut quarter rice from Gap from that era on Poshmark for like 20 bucks and they were I'm sure I owned them in 2000 when I was in college so you do sort of as trend cycle through you do sort of repeat things but the thing for me with that look in particular and I had a friend who from college who was really obsessed with skirt over pants and it just like never worked for me it's just not I don't like the other thing I wonder if all the layering because we're in this weird climate situation where it's cold half the time so people need layers and it just was never my thing the idea of like adding another layer to my waist is just crazy like I don't it was never for me but I do think it speaks to like we don't have mono trends we don't have a monoculture anymore that was never really a thing that was adopted super widely but the fact that everyone it kind of is like a micro version of everybody freaking out that like skinny jeans aren't a thing anymore or whatever and I don't know it's just as someone who who tracks trends that's a huge part of your job and you do an amazing trend report on essence that's really fun what do you think it says about the state of our culture that people like how to freak out over this knowing because you have all the context that many of them don't have like do some psychoanalysis on the consumer yeah let me psychoanalyze the skirt over pants I mean I've pulled up the image on my screen that we're talking about I think what is really getting people going here is that in theory this is an incredibly basic outfit it's a gray crewneck sweater it's a white like lacy slip dress it's I can't tell if the pants are denim or sort of like a navy chino and it's a flip flop like these are all items that you could buy at the Gap in 1999 it's not fashion that feels particularly new and so I think it's really like it taps some nerve of feeling basic but also innovative that I think everyone's trying to get out and I would say like you know you're right about the skirt over pants going for a while I think in the past two years I was just looking this morning because there was a pair of Kiko Kostadov women's trousers that had like a mini skirt sort of half built in on the front and the back but not the sides and that was like 2022 and that's when Kalina Strauta started doing the mini skirt belts over cargo pants and so I think we're sort of seeing this trickle up of this look that feels I'm going to do air quotes here unstudied you know I think there's a general air for people to feel not so formal all the time you know everyone's trying to find a way to look unplanned but still fabulous yeah so I think this kind of taps into that psychological urge that's like oh I just threw it on like I'm just wearing my flip flops with my boot cuts I'm not overthinking it I'm just I mean it is they Ashley and Mary Kate or Mary Kate and Ashley paradox which is like you know they care so much about clothes they have the best clothing collection in the world but their goal is to look unsteadied and just casual and so I think like seeing something like this just really it provokes nostalgia it provokes desire it provokes confusion because again it's like this model is you know six feet tall and very thin like this is a look that maybe doesn't travel so well beyond that body type so I think there's also like an underlying fury where you're like I know it looks good on her but on me I'm gonna look like you know like you're trying too hard this is like maybe what I wear to walk my dog like you're trying to it was really funny I went to a store and then we can move on to to real news but I went to a store a couple weeks ago this is realness and I bought a black pencil skirt and the guy said to me you know you really have like a whole like Mary Kate and Ashley look because he was like do you have a bag I mean obviously I don't look like them I'm like literally twice their size and whatever but he was like you really have their sort of look I wear like a lot of Isaac Raina bags because I never can make decisions and it was like my laptop bag it's like looks if you didn't know it was Isaac Raina you'd be like did she get this a to me or something like that and he was like you should get like a beat up Birken it's it would be very and I'm like you don't get it I can't get a Birken because I'm not I'm not one of the Olsen twins and I would look dumb like it's not but it was nice that he was like you have like a very Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen but like three years ago Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen not now because I'm not that bohemian but um it was just funny because there are certain things you just can't pull off I mean I could if I wanted to but there are certain blockers we all have in in our heads that stop it and it it does come back to like the psychology of why we buy things and this is something that when the Peter Copping Lombam news was announced I thought a lot about which was you know you can really engineer success in fashion by having a bunch of stores to distribute goods and then also selling things like easy merch or sneakers like Lombam has a really good sneaker business they have a good ballet flat business their ballet flat which was really popular 10 15 20 years ago is regaining popularity but the thing is I feel like to have brand heat as a lot of fashion executives like to say you have to make clothes like the row makes to get people excited and I thought hiring Peter Copping to be the creative director which this is I mean they haven't had a creative director I think for almost two years and Peter is a veteran he worked at Louis Vuitton for a long time under Mark Jacobs doing women's wear and then he was the Nina Ricci designer and I have a very funny story about one of his fashion shows where I it was really hot it was in the Tullarys and I was probably like there were 15 rows I was probably row eight or something and it was so hot and I almost fell asleep like beautiful clothes but I was like I'm gonna fall asleep and then like a pita person came out or someone like that and I was like is this every time that happens I think it's part of the show I'm always like is this part of the show before I'm like oh yeah just but anyway and then he went to Oscar de la Renta he was handpicked by Oscar it didn't work out there it was like a really bad fit I think probably culturally like a bad business fit and I remember his collections there like some of them are good some of them were like felt like really forced I don't know how many he did it must have only been a couple but um or maybe I mean it was more than one but it was not that many anyway he was designing Balenciaga Couture for a while most recently he's been doing their VIP so he's grown as a designer but what I'm excited about is that suddenly that's going to be a place that if you do need a dress if you want to dress up or if you need I'm interested in brands that are making clothes that are interesting I might only end up buying shoes but I want the clothes to be interesting as well and I'm I'm curious what you think about like where that brand fits in the fashion continuum and what he could bring to the table well I was really excited when I saw the announcement because I think Peter is someone who just has incredible taste like in the intermissions between his creative director jobs he was posting a lot on Instagram like interior design references and like beautiful travel pictures and I think it's like you just kind of want to feel a part of the world that he inhabits you know very sort of artisanal thoughtful British maybe like countryside vibes happening in Peter Copping universe and you know I think for better or worse everyone still thinks of Lanvane's Albert's brand and when he was there it was really the place I would say for dresses like beautiful dresses easy dresses fabulous dresses day dresses beach dresses night dresses just like a dress is paradise remember the collaboration with Acne yes jean dresses yeah I had this gorgeous denim dress that I it was the only at Barney's right they sold it at Barney's it's gorgeous denim dress with a gros grain like a wasted flared skirt with a gros grain black belt I definitely sold it it's so annoying because I would wear it now yeah in the H&M collab as well that was so good yeah many people wore that to my wedding I was gonna say I think Britt wore that to your life she did I remember but you know what that iteration of Lanvane was aspirational but it was also functional you know like everything had that big zipper so you could zip yourself up into your own dress it was like stretchy breezy and I think like women are desperately craving something like that I think that's why there's so much to borrow the term brand heat at Chloe since Shemina came in because people just need like a great fabulous dress that they can wear with flats or with boots or with sneakers and so I think like my hope for Peter Copping's Lanvane is that it kind of continues to fill that space where it's like day clothes but that are really fab or really eclectic or really beautiful I mean he's a very talented designer and as we know from the three or four Oscar de la Renta collections that he did and Balenciaga like this man can make a gown that's gorgeous like I think about the blue gown with the gros grain ribbon that he made at Oscar de la Renta to me that was like his best show and those dresses were just like stunning I think everyone like if you're trying to have like a princess fashion girl moment like he can deliver but like you said I think it'll be really interesting to see like what are the what are the everyday clothes look like I just am obsessed with normal clothes I just think we need more brands that are making things that people could viably wear yeah it can get a little conceptual yeah and I think going back to this point of you want to see more than just dresses at a couture everything has to have a purpose so we want to see dresses from Peter Copping because that's what he makes well and I want to see his suit whatever suit he's going to do for them whatever like Lanvane there's a lot of black in in those collections so like what is he going to do in black what's he going to do with lace what's he going to do with flounciness all of that I think the point right now needs to be you need to prove why you need to exist these otherwise like we all have closets totally full of crap like I bought more stuff when I was in Europe and I'm like oh I actually didn't need these two Saint Laurent louses like I mean they were vintage so I'm not that crazy but I have like seven Saint Laurent vintage louses did I need two more no but like if you can stoke that desire then it makes it worth it this show is brought to you by

podcasts the odyssey app spotify or wherever you get your podcast so one final note okay want to talk about the rumor of the week which is a long-standing conversation that will not be resolved anytime soon but there was more reporting kathy horn had a good story in the cut last week about what's going on at chanel and bruno pavlovsky who is the president of fashion at chanel's been there forever said they have not made a choice about who is coming in and he said it on the record so interestingly though kathy brought up some names that are obviously not happening like nadej at air mess and nadej please don't take the chanel job i don't want that to happen and it's not good for you it's not good for anyone involved but kind of it was like well this person said this to me and nadej would be good or whatever i'm curious who do you want because one thing that kathy said was that there was a young british designer who's been talking to them she didn't name the person and i wondered if it was samon roshah because i feel like people have brought up samon roshah to me in the same way people have brought up nadej to to kathy like i don't know why they're not no one's talking about samon it's this is a really complicated job like i was thinking about it the other day and if heady is not getting it is he gonna get dior but the same issues like these are just these jobs are gargantuan unless what they're gonna do is just give this person the runway and make the run because they clearly were mad that virgini was not getting good reviews so maybe they are gonna just let this person do runway and it won't really connect with the retail the commercial stuff because the commercial stuff is doing really well like i almost bought five pairs of shoes when i was in in paris so i didn't buy any but um who do you want who is your dream mark jacob's uh well you know day one when the news came out i was like hello mark jacob's like i need eyes on mark jacob's right now his office is very close to the essence office and so you know i like to look out the window and see what's happening there yeah but i think like we as an industry have been yearning maybe for a little bit of a shake up that's felt like a slightly delayed after virgil died and then alessandro left gucci there was like the opportunity for something you know a full round of musical chairs that i don't think happened because a lot of sort of studio design members got promotions or a lot of like existing people just kind of did it like a big job swap in a way that didn't really fuel the gossip industry the way that the chanel job obviously it's just like every dinner i went to people are like i heard this i heard that it's this person da da da so all to say i've been thinking about this a lot and people have been talking about it a lot i think for a job as gargantuan is this my free idea for the headhunters at chanel is sophia capola oh wow this is such a good idea please if if you work at chanel and you're listening to this podcast take this to hr because i think they had ferrell doing some things oh my god this is such a good idea they like need a celebrity basically they need someone who can direct the brad pit campaign yes who can get all the cute girls in the slip dresses who has this like romantic womanly vision and who could literally create a direct an atelier of people to which i would also propose julie de lebron to like do some of the couture heard so and hers their friends yeah yes their friends i really believe that this is the right choice it would be great to see a woman at the head of chanel so phia used to be an intern there so i'm really hard pitching this idea so please this is a great idea this is a great idea also the one thing they could also do is have mark and sophia do it together yes i mean like a raft a raft product mrs prod a combo thing because and and bring in julie de lebron like get the gang from louis baton yeah i get the team back together i think this is brilliant and you need to write an essay about this for someone i don't it is someone write it in the newsletter when you're promoting the podcast be like i will people of fashion here's your million dollar idea yeah i i will let's not discuss scheduling now i might tease it on monday and flesh it out on wednesday but the one thing i would say is sophia coppola her creative process i mean she's busy she's got the augustin's daughter collab she's got the berry collab like she's good she's got she's working i'm wearing the augustin's daughter lip balm right now um the thing i would say is she for rel could do it because he has 50 million jobs and he's constantly working i think sophia coppola probably has a lot more free free time whereas like for all doesn't need that i have a feeling sophia coppola probably needs time to process things and think and this job is like such high pressure that's why i wonder if like her and mark doing it together but this is the best idea ever so i'm so into this thank you i've heard every name as a rumor and i just think like the thing about this job is it has to stick there's no opportunity maybe with other brands you know chanel is like the most famous fashion brand in the world that you can have someone for three years and get rid of them or have someone for two collections it's like they don't really have the luxury to make a mistake here which i think a lot of the people that have been discussed it's like heady would be amazing but he doesn't stay at a place for more than five or six years and then you know i doubt that brunow powlowski wants to do this all over again in well but the the thing that i write in mondays that i already wrote this is coming out tuesday we're going back and forth in time here thing that i write in mondays is like too bad because there's no one's gonna stay for 20 years the idea that they're gonna get someone what i think they need to do is get someone who can reestablish something that which heady slumann can do so like he was at dior for seven years they like were out to lunch on that or whatever that phrase is like what is that called dining out on that they were dining out on that until 2018 2019 until kim jones came so chris van ash was definitely part of the heady continuum and then at san loran same thing like anthony vacarela has changed it a lot now but to be honest like you go into the stores stores basically look like they did when heady was there and also i still go there for the same reasons i went when heady was there which is like i needed a pointy black pump with a slingback that didn't have a big logo on it and that's what i got i need chelsea boots that you get it i need a blazer you go there it's like the codes he established that were connected to san loran but like a very heady thing it lasts a long time so i think like my thing with this idea that they're gonna have to be able to get someone who who stays for more than a decade that is good and that does something i just think like gotta hire nickle guess garak because you know he he sticks around so maybe you can get him out of his contract but yeah i know what you mean i will die on my heady hill or or as one podcast listener said you're not supposed to pronounce the age so i really need to stop but i was like i don't really care i'm american but i will die on my heady hill but i think that the sophia coppola thing is is maybe your most brilliant idea ever ever wow it's really good on the phone with bruno peblowski bruno are you listening i have a feeling not but but maybe one of his deputies is or maybe one of the worthimers yeah like you said it's it's a gargantuan job and you know even throughout obviously carl was a genius and throughout virgini's tenure there was a real effort to build chanel into more of an entertainment business you know hiring celebrities directing these like truly cinematic campaigns and i think to compete on the lv level you sort of need a person with that level of fame or gravitas or influence i think you're right and i think if it's not sophia that you're steering them in the right direction but it should be sophia we love her it would be amazing i would truly die no i know we would i would never die close anywhere else i would become a full chanel girl say if it was sophia say might buy like two things a year yeah i mean it honestly we started talking about the row and it's a similar thing where it's like you fantasize about being ashley and mary kate because they are stylish and iconic and i think like every woman has fantasized at some point about being sophia coppola having the hair the outfits the suits the slip dresses the car heart pants i feel like you tweeted about her car heart of course i bought them yeah no me too it's just like what would donnie mal who's editor in chief of fashionista another one of my former interns said we used to say what would sophia coppola do or whatever and it is a thing of donnie really kept with that i deviated a little bit but recently i've been back i'd say that since moving to california actually it's just like she just has it and there's very few have you seen the jeff mcfederidge documentary no he did um virgin suicides and i think the milk fed logo and sophia coppola and i maybe talked about this on another podcast so apologies people but i have i have no life but um he i think maybe christ was on last week and maybe we discussed this i don't know but spiked jones and sophia coppola are both in the documentary and then he did a q and a was in la the hollyhock house like is so la and i was just like these are the last people that are cool to me yeah like they're the only people in the world that i still think are cool because when i was i don't know 14 or 13 or 12 or whatever they were literally the coolest people on earth i was just like i will never be as cool as these people and they're the last generation where cool actually exists and but she had on like a cashmere sweatshirt and really fancy jewelry and i was just like you're so cool i just want to be you and there's literally no one else in the world you get over that as you age but i still feel that way about her like she just i remember once i interviewed her at this like car tv party and i was doing for in style and it was a page in the book and she was like have we met before and i was like uh i interviewed you on the red carpet for the h&m for sachi clarrish but the thing i wanted to say was no we haven't but i just copy your clothes i'd on a black dress with like little gold chains and my hair was just like trying to be just like hers i was like some some weird stuff but anyway stuff thank you for such an inspiring conversation especially this last bit i hope you can come on again and we can chat more i love what you're doing in essence thanks i love chatting with you i feel like we didn't talk about how you are my first fashion boss i did mention it in the newsletter i did mention the fact that i tried to get you to drop out of school to work for me full time that was actually the people who were running the company i was working for his idea and i was like sure who needs a college degree right this 19 year old seems great i mean you were very mature for your age thanks well every time i walk past that pink coffee i have like an acid flashback to us sitting there and you'd be like well college like you really need it my god that's a story for a friday episode but um yes step this is really great love to air and we'll talk
