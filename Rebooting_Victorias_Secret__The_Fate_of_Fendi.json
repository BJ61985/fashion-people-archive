Today with me on the show, we've got Jessica Testa, a fashion reporter at the New York Times to discuss all the greatest and latest news. First up, why did American designer Mara Hoffman just close her brand? Second up, why is Victoria's Secret relaunching their fashion show? And finally, we will end with the most important question of all, what are these sunglasses Ashley Olsen has been wearing? Plus, as always, the rumor of the week. Let's get started. Hey, everyone. I hope you had a good weekend. I am back in Los Angeles. I landed Saturday morning from the Savannah College of Art and Designs annual fashion show. I took my kid, when I got here, I took my kid to these hilariously exclusive swimming lessons at a friend's house. It's called swim to bill, if any of you live in LA and have a small child. It's the kind of thing that I personally would never strive to do, but I jumped on the bandwagon very quickly when my friend was hosting. So hopefully my kid will be able to swim unaccompanied by the end of this week. I'll give you an update. I also baked him a cake. I had a birthday party for him. I finished yesterday's newsletter and now I'm starting all over again. My Monday private email did have a dispatch from SCAD. So thanks to everyone over there, JJ, Jonathan, Scotty, and of course, Dirk, Jose from Vogue Runway is also an alum of SCAD. Aurora James, not big on fashion graduation shows. I'm not a very patient person. I find the whole process sort of indulgent, but I felt really optimistic and had such a nice time. So thank you all for having me. Who doesn't want to be in Savannah for a weekend when it's not that hot? It was really lovely. In the newsletter, I also very importantly have an update on the very quiet reorganization of LVMH behind the scenes of Fashion Group. I wrote on Thursday about how Michael Burke, the current CEO of the Fashion Group, who previously was the CEO of Louis Vuitton and before that Fendi and has been working with Bernard Narno since 1986. So for a really long time, like before it was a real fashion company when it was still really a real estate thing. He seems to be taking some sort of step back a couple of weeks ago. I had reported that Delphine Narno, Bernard Narno's oldest child and the current CEO of Dior had taken it was it was moving into a larger role in the business. And this seems to be related to that. I don't know how permanent any of this is. Sidney Toledano, who was CEO of the Fashion Group, previous to Michael Burke and before that he was the CEO of Dior. I'm sure none of this makes sense to many of you. And a lot of sense to others. But he Sidney, who had sort of semi-retired as was like advising the group is now back and doing a little bit more day to day. I heard a lot of feedback on Friday from people connected to the group and executives. And they also reminded me that I need to be looking at this guy here at Manuel, Angela Lough, which I'm sure I'm pronouncing that wrong. But he is the current deputy CEO of the Fashion Group. So he looks after, directly looks after a lot of the smaller like sub $2 billion brands, Fendi, Marc Jacobs, Stella McCartney, et cetera. And before that he was Burke's deputy at LV. But only for a few years, previous Pierre-Emanuel, Angela Lough worked at L'Oreal for a long time. And so of this generation of LVMH executive that comes from beauty or CPG and is really like a brand manager. My big takeaway from all of this is that like something is obviously happening behind the scenes that is either personal or interpersonal or something. And because this is not how LVMH does things, the Burke succession into that role with Sidney sort of retiring was really carefully planned like years in the making. And so usually they kind of work all this stuff out. I wonder what Antoine Arnaud's role is in all of this. One of the LVMH comms people told me last year that there were quote unquote big things in store for him after he left his role as CEO of Berluti. So we'll see. He is really involved in the Olympics and is probably focused on that. Yeah, it's just an interesting company to cover at this time. So I'm very excited to have Jessica on today. She's a fabulous writer and there's probably no one I enjoy sitting with at the shows more than her. So I hope you have a good time. Jessica, thanks for being here. We're on the same coast, which is not not typical. How are you enjoying your time in LA? I know it's a brief trip. I'm enjoying it very much. It's quite chilly here in the mornings. Wasn't expecting that. But it's a short short one for me. So I'll be back in New York tomorrow. You need everyone needs their barber jacket here, which is hilarious because it's the last place you'd ever think to wear a barber jacket. But I've had mine for like 10 years and hadn't worn it for years. And now I wear it every single morning. Also helps that these like barn field coat type things are very trendy right now. I was just about to say that I, I'm a fan of this trend personally. Yeah, it's good. It's like an easy, an easy thing to incorporate into your wardrobe for sure. Now, if you were, if you were to buy a barn jacket, would you buy like a true barn jacket or would you get the designer version? No, I have a barber bedale, like a classic one. And I just got the NOAA collaboration one because I saw so many people. A friend of mine out here has one. And I saw two people in New York, a guy and a woman wearing them and they're so good. It's from like two years ago and you can get them for essentially at cost on Grail or eBay. And they came in all these really great colors. I got red. I feel like it's an easy trend that you can wear. It's preppy, but like you don't, you can wear it in a non preppy. I don't like, I don't have designer sneakers. I don't have, I just, I don't do that. Other than I do have a pair of sneakers from the row that look like LA gear. They have the row stitched on the side, but it looks like that, like old school LA gear pads. But what about you? Are you, have you indulged in this trend yet? I have a Macintosh, but I really like the Prada barn jackets with the leather collars that came out last season. I've been lusting after those, I will say. Yes, they're very good. I was sad that they were not at the sample sale. I'd say generally I tend to, if it's, if it's a classic item, I tend to go with the more standard industrial brand, but there are certain things like that, that if you have $5,000, totally worth, totally worth the money. There was some big news over the weekend in the fashion world that I guess I wasn't surprised about in the end, but I think probably shocked a lot of her fans. The American designer, Mara Hoffman, who started her brand at 2000, she's been around for a long time, but has, has become more popular in the last few years. She started making these stretchy dresses made out of a popcorn fabric that became like the go-to dress for wedding guests, I would say. She announced that she's putting a pause on her brand, which essentially means she's closing it, but maybe they're leaving it open to, to reopen it someday. And I guess I'm actually not surprised about it because I sat with her at the CFDA's, this pad, the CFDA awards this past November and she actually said something to me, where she, essentially like, I don't think I can do this forever or I'm not sure it's really hard. She tries to produce stuff in a very responsible way that's environmentally responsible, ethically responsible and it's really created a lot of challenges for anyone who's trying to do it in, in that fashion. And she kind of made this comment about, I don't know if I'm going to be able to, it's just so hard. And I, I mean, designers say that kind of stuff to me all the time. So I kind of was like, sure, but you love doing this and you'll keep it going somehow. But I guess she decided it was just, she had had enough. I'm so curious what you think about this. Well, I think the writing was on the wall too when she closed her store within the last few months, her store in Lower Manhattan. And I also was not surprised because it is so expensive to do what she does, to, to, to do it sustainably, not just using sustainable fabrics, which are more expensive, but producing in, in New York, producing in places where there are more sort of standards around, around worker production. And she, it's just, it's so expensive. And I, and her prices are reasonable. These are not luxury prices. She exists in that mid tier. So it just didn't seem like the numbers were adding up as much. And I'm, and I'm quite sad about that. I do own the popcorn skirt and I put it on the New York Times gift guide this year because it is a great, it's so versatile and people love it. It's like one of those pieces you always get compliments about. I was one of those people who was disappointed and I was also disappointed because she, another thing she did that did not necessarily make her money was offer inclusive sizing. And I saw a lot of people, a lot of like sort of plus size influencers and creators posting over the weekend disappointment for the brand's closing for that reason too. Yeah. I mentioned that in my email on Monday that she did inclusive sizing without it feeling it was pandering or marketing. It just was the stuff fits a lot of different types of bodies and looks good on a lot of different types of bodies. And so it's kind of, it is a bummer that someone who's just trying to make beautiful things that, that people really, really love wearing can't make the numbers work. But the reality of the industry is like we did, I did that pricing episode with Elizabeth Vondergoldsen. If you want to make something in a responsible way with fabrics that aren't going to totally pollute the environment or whatever. And also with, as you said, local workers who are getting paid a fair wage, the amount of money you have to charge to make any profit off of it is, is a lot. And then the consumer doesn't expect that and doesn't, and won't accept that things are expensive. So it's really too bad. I hope that she comes up with some sort of solution and maybe a lot of creative people have other ideas about what they want to do. Maybe she wants to pursue fine art or some other avenue of creativity. But otherwise I hope she, she can figure something out where she can make the pricing work for the customer and for her, for her margins. But it's, it's sad. I was a little surprised that she didn't keep the swimwear going. I thought that that could have been a path forward to sort of keep going because her bathing suits were really popular. But I do think it's, you know, there's always a lot of press, including from yours truly, when a small young designer is struggling. And I think that it's important to have this story out there too, because Mara Hoffman was not small. She was not young. She's been around for a while. She's been working in this business. She's well respected. She actually like mentors young designers. And to show that like it's even hard for somebody like that to, to keep going as import, just as important as, you know, when we talk about the young designers who can't make it work. Yeah. I mean, generally this business doesn't work. And it doesn't, it gets, it doesn't get easier. Every season is different. And you have to, unless you're Levi's or, or you have a sneaker that sells every season, no matter what, it's hard to keep a baseline of profitability. And a lot of brands don't. I was talking to another designer who's been around, around the same amount of time as Mara a couple of weeks ago, and she was also like, I'm so sick of this. And it's gotten harder and harder to be profitable because of all these other factors that we mentioned. On the other hand, I think there's also beauty in knowing when to quit. And I've seen a lot of brands desperate to keep going for a multitude of reasons. Sometimes it's because of ego. Sometimes it's because of shame. Sometimes it's because they don't know what else to do. And so they enter these deals with investors who are kind of not right for them. And then the business implodes again, and you hear about brands relaunching like four or five times over the course of, of their existence. And sometimes I think it's actually just good to walk away. We'll see. She's a thoughtful person. And one thing that is interesting to me about the American fashion industry is a lot of the independent brands are run by women and the ones that have been around for a long time. And I think women just tend to be more practical about this stuff. And so I hope whatever she does next is, I'm sure it'll be just as interesting and impactful, but it is, it is too bad for, for all the people who enjoy wearing her clothes. I mean, fashion is a pleasure. And to be that pleasure to be taken away from you is, is a little, a little bit mournful.

But what did you think about Victoria's Secret announcing that their annual fashion show is returning this fall? First of all, I am skeptical that they're going to pull this off because I don't really understand where they're going to get the money to do this. But what did you think when you heard the news that they were bringing back the runway show? I have to be honest. I felt nothing. I felt I was because it doesn't. It's never been something that resonated with me. And I just don't. I think like you, I don't. I haven't wrapped my head around the fact that it's actually happening. And I just don't. I can't imagine a scenario in which it is an event that is like must see TV like it once was. And how many have you been to? At least four, I think. I eventually stopped going to them. So just some context for people who are unfamiliar. The Victoria's Secret fashion show was this annual televised for a long time fashion show. It started in the mid 90s. And it was the first sort of fashion is media. And they staged the show where they would have models walked on the runway in different costumes and lingerie. And it was really hokey. And then they would have a musical performance, which actually was usually the best part of it. And it became a big fashion industry thing where a lot of people attended. Also like a lot of like financey people, famous people outside of fashion, definitely celebrities, but it became like a real New York thing. They used to host it at the Lexington Avenue Armory. And it was a big deal, especially. It started in 1995. The first show was at the Plaza. And then they had one, I think in Cannes at the turn of the century. And it like broke the internet. If you could do that at the time, it was the first live stream show. It was really, really innovative when you think about it. But by the time I started attending and I probably 2010 around, it was it was just like a huge cheese fest. And I don't know. I always thought it was super gross, but people loved it. They thought it was fun and flirty and silly and all these dudes would go and sit in the front row and ogle. And I always thought it was disgusting, but a lot of people didn't. And then they had to get rid of it because of me too. And the marketing guy had raised, except all this terrible stuff publicly. And then Les Wexner, his association with Jeffrey Epstein kind of came to the fore when all the Epstein stuff happened in the late 2010s. And I don't know if you all know, but I wrote a book about Victoria's Secret that's coming out October 8. Please preorder it. But it eventually they decided to discontinue it. And last week they announced we're bringing it back. And it's so silly. Like it doesn't make any sense anymore. And I feel bad. I don't, I don't, I guess I don't feel bad, but it's just unfortunate for the people who work there who are trying very hard to turn this business around, which has been struggling. It's, it's last quarterly results were a little bit better because they were discounting so much, but generally I just think the marketing and the, the, they have a great designer who'd been there for a long time, who came back a couple of years ago, but the design, marketing and distribution strategy just haven't aligned. And I think they think we need to be sexy again. They kind of moved away from being sexy and tried to really focus on things like we were talking about before, inclusivity and diversity. And it just came off as, like I said, pandering. It, it didn't ring true. And so it just, like, like you said, you feel nothing. The brand means nothing to, I think pretty much everyone, there are people who still buy it because they've been buying the same bras forever. And as, as we both know, it's not easy to find a good fitting bra. I did work at Victoria's Secret for two weeks in college and I quit. I couldn't do it. Like it was just so ridiculous. They, they, I was, I worked at this Christmas store in Boston's Faneuil Hall year long Christmas store called the Christmas Dev. And so after Christmas, it's really slow. So they basically lay everyone off for two, two months. And so my friend was like, well, I'm going to go work at Victoria's Secret because it's booming at Valentine's Day. I said, okay, and I bought you, we all to wear black blazers. I got this black blazer from H&M and I get there. And they're, first of all, they, they're like, here's how to fit a bra. So I'm fitting a bra for people. I've been doing this for like a week. So that's when first off, A, I was never like into Victoria's Secret or whatever. Like I never thought it was that great. But the things that they really pushed were every bra needs a matching panty. And then the other part was that they really wanted you to sign up for the credit card because the credit, external credit card company that a lot of these retailers used was also owned by Les Wexner, who owned Victoria's Secret. So I used to walk around the store with a paper pad to get people to sign up for the credit card. And at some point I did do a couple of good sales. Like I think I got a free bra because I was able to get enough sales. But after two weeks, I was like, I can't do this. It's too much. And I actually just left the H&M blazer at the store. Yes. But the point being that it's not, it, it, the brand used to mean a lot to people. And I don't think it means anything to even people. You're a bit younger than me, I think, but like of our generation and also. Definitely not Gen Z and Alpha or whatever. I will say I have been interested to see Sabrina Carpenter wearing some Victoria's Secret pieces. Yeah. I, when the, when the show was announced, she was my first thought for like, who are they going to get for, to perform for talent? She has this very big song right now that that me espresso. And I think that she. Wait, what's it called? Because I, I obviously know. It's called espresso. No. Okay. Espresso. I don't know. I guess I'll listen to it someday. I don't know it. I know who she's dating. She's dating that guy, but. Berry. Yeah. Berry Cogan or whatever. She, I think Victoria's Secret has made a few custom pieces for her that she's worn. And she has this very sexy baby aesthetic. And I think that that, that is sort of like a retro pinup thing. And I, I think that she was my prediction for who they'll get. But in that sense, I do wonder if there are any Gen Z fans, but this and the casting for the show will be on point, I think, that just based on who they've gotten to be in their campaigns since their sort of relaunch toward diversity and inclusivity. But I don't, I also think another problem with the show happening now is that star power is not the same as it was 10 years ago. And that's what you really need to make something like this work on, on, on the mass level that it did before. And we don't have like the celebrity structure, the structure of the celebrity world is different now. Yes. 100%. That's exactly right. It's such a good point. It's about direct, the celebrity's direct relationship with their fans. And it makes the Sabrina Carpenter thing that, that makes sense. And, and I just don't think they've been very strategic and why they haven't been very strategic. There are many reasons, but I mean, my whole thing is that I think a bunch of different people want to buy Victoria's Secret. It's ripe. It's a public company right now. It's ripe for a take private. There are a lot of people who used to be involved with the business who are interested in buying it. A lot of different like private equity firm type companies. I think that Abercrombie and Fitch should buy it, which would be interesting and full circle because they used to be part of the same group. Les Wexner also owned Abercrombie and Fitch and spun it out in the mid 90s and made a ton of money off of it. And it's big success with its CEO, Mike Jeffries, but Abercrombie and Fitch has been doing really well. They have the CEO, Jan Horowitz, who actually, who also worked at a Les Wexner company called Express for a long time, but she worked at many places. She's not like a less disciple, like a lot of these retailers. I wouldn't call her that necessarily, but the point being she's done extremely well with Abercrombie. And what she did was she sort of divorced it from the whole Bruce Weber catalog, preppy orgy thing and made it very much about like cool jeans and cool shirts and things that like tick talkers will talk about and say I love and it's been a real word of mouth thing. And I know so many people of all different ages who now own Abercrombie jeans, which costs like, I don't 80 bucks or something. You can probably get them on sale for 40. So she's just done a really kind of crazy job with it. And I could see her being interested in applying that same ethos to Victoria's Secret where you strip it of all the history and you just do cute stuff that people are excited about. It's a little more complicated. I'd say the Mike Jeffery's CEO disaster is a little bit more recoverable than what happened with Wexner and Victoria's Secret and also Victoria's Secret's much more overtly about sex because it's something you wear on your body. It's not clothing or whatever. So it's a little different, but that would be the ideal situation to me. It's still a brand that people know what it means and what it stands for. And so that's valuable. But what do you think? Do you think that consumers care about brands today or do they just like are they totally driven by price and aesthetic or what would you do if you could relaunch Victoria's Secret? I do think that there is a desire and a need for a mall brand tier company to make really good underwear. I think that people don't there's not a sort of centralized brand for really, really good undergarments. I personally, I really miss Gap body. Did you ever shop at Gap body? They had great stuff. Yeah, I mean, totally. That's when I was saying I wasn't really into Victoria's Secret. That's because I was shopping at Gap body. Yeah, I agree. I think that like the how to find a good bra thing is just it's great. The industrial engineering is very challenging and just bras are insane and they hurt and they suck and there really aren't. It's very hard to find one. Everybody is totally different. And the Gap body like underwear wise, I agree. I still buy some from Gap. I really like this brand that Becky Malinski recommended, Naturi, which is like an old lady brand, Josie Naturi. I've definitely met her. She also designed apparel, but those are the best underwear I've ever had. And I now only buy them exclusively. It's just cotton, the ones that I buy. But yes, it could be. It's like kind of like the American hand row. But yeah, it's it's really hard to find and affordable and like you can buy them in multiples, but then Naturi, I highly I think they're called the Bliss and they come in all different styles, but they are the most comfortable underwear I've ever owned and I switched over exclusively when after Becky recommended them. I think that people are inundated with these like Instagram ads and TikTok ads for underwear for like these DTC underwear brands that are just these. And there's just so many of them and they're all so small. And I do I think there's like room for a dominant player there. But it's sort of what we were talking about with the way that celebrity culture has changed, where you don't have like you don't necessarily have this group of a few celebrities who are driving sales and driving sort of cultural relevance. You have this wide pool of people who now include like influencers and and it's it makes it hard to know like what hard to hard to have direction as a consumer when there's just so many people, so many brands at this in the pool and instead of like a dominant player being like, no, come shop with us. You want our underwear. For sure. Which is why Victoria's Secret should not be a six billion dollar a year business. They should be like a three billion dollar a year business and have a few more that are around that size. And then we get some choice, but also a little direction. And, you know, if you want to fix the fashion industry, just call me. Also, I think this is so this is great for your book. Oh, yeah. I mean, it's perfect. If this actually happens, it's like the ideal timing because our book comes out October 8th and this would happen in November. Chantal had heard it was going to happen in Chantal Fernandez, my co-writer on the book had heard it was going to happen in November. So usually it would happen in early November and then they would air it around Thanksgiving that week. Instead of watching Charlie Brown Christmas, you'd watch the Victoria's Secret fashion show, I guess, or it was always like running before or after a football game, you know, CBS, whatever. Yeah, it'll be great. So I hope it happens. And I wish that I truly wish them the best. It's the, there are a lot of great people who work there trying really hard and they just haven't been able to figure it out. But let's move on to the most important topic of the session, which is these sunglasses. I saw you posting on Instagram that Ashley Olson, the co-designer of the row, was wearing a couple of days ago. And can you explain to me your interest in these glasses and why they became like a topic of conversation for you for several days? I mean, look, like most millennial women who work in fashion or media, I have an acute fascination with the things the Olsons wear and make. I think you do too a bit. Yeah, of course, I love them, but have probably never received as many DMs from fashion people. When I asked this question, which is basically I was trying to source the sunglasses. Ashley has been wearing lately. There were there were two pairs, both had reddish or orangeish lenses and black frames. And what was the shape? Can you describe the shape? One pair was like a wrap around, like a almost like a sporty style that that's very popular right now. And then the other pair was more also a bit wrap around, but more of a subtle version of that. They were not big oval sunglasses that I think people associate with the Olson twins in like 2008 or something. They were they were definitely more modern. And I think they were able to be worn inside because of the orange lenses. Do you think they were prescription? I mean, maybe, maybe. I put out a call though. I was like, people tell me tell me where these are from. I haven't been able to figure out. I have I had a group chat where we were sort of exchanging screenshots and doing some reverse Google image searching. Nobody could figure it out. So I put out a call and I think that the most likely answer was Mason Maison Bonnet, this custom only in London, only in Paris, Sunglasses brand, which is the most annoying answer that it's custom and it and you probably won't be able to ever get them. But if a friend of a friend of someone in the Olson world reported this back and also Justin from DLX, I had obviously had a lot of fashion PR people who I who I targeted for this question. I was like, you have to I need your and this is your time to help us out. They both reported that they were they were most likely from this custom Sunglasses maker. That's definitely what it is. And we know that the Olsons are now spending a lot of time in Paris, like a lot of their team lives there. They're opening a store there. Of course, that's where they get their sunglasses. If they're not if they're not from the road itself, of course, they're doing some custom thing. Yeah. And someone did suggest somebody sent a link to a row and all of our people's collab that was pretty similar that is currently on the real rail. If you want the link, I'll send it to you. There's they're still available. But it was just crazy. It was like one publicist took an opportunity to pitch via email their own sunglasses brand that they represent. Like I was getting all of these dupes. You know, another popular answer. Another popular answer from people was Jacques Marine Maj. Rory from WSJ. That was her guess. That's in Los Angeles based brand. Also a French person and is really expensive sunglasses. They're made in the studio around the corner and it's in the area. It's in the Sycamore district. Their whole operation where just one eye, a cool store in Tartine and Jeffrey Deitch and Off-Scene General. And it's this whole boaty is down the street. It's like a real little fashion scene over there. It's my favorite. Really the only place I ever go quote unquote shopping in LA. But yeah, I was actually talking to a French person in London last week about this brand. They had just met with them in in LA and it's really impressive. But yeah, you see the thing that the Olsen's tend to do is they will collaborate with these smaller brands and then they end up. They used to sell Manola Blonix before they really had a huge shoe business themselves. They'll bring in all of her people's another good example. They'll collaborate with these cool little indie upstarts that have a lot of weight in the industry and then eventually they do their own thing. So maybe we'll see a similar version of these sunglasses, these custom sunglasses when, you know, in two years or would have you on theroad.com. But we won't see photos from that show from anyone's phone because there will be another social media blackout. But I'm sure there will be. I know I got so many. I mean, I have so many links to dupes that people sent me. So if you're curious, maybe I'll maybe I'll post them when this episode comes out. Yeah, post them and maybe we can put some in the in the show notes as well. Where do you get your sunglasses? I wear a mascot. I also have per sole. I have a pair of per soles, but I mostly wear mascots. I wear again, this is a thing I don't wear designer sunglasses. It's the same thing about the the barber jacket or sneakers. I wear a sunglass brand. So I used to exclusively wear per soles or per sole. I don't even know how you pronounce that. And then something shifted and I started wearing more mascot. So I but I'm interested in Jacques Marie Maj. But it is they're technically men's, but whatever. I have a big head so I could pull it off. If if Ashley Olson can pull it off, if hers are actually Jacques Marie Maj. But what do you wear? I I know I rotate between I have a Warby Parker pair that I wear when I'm not sort of afraid of sunglasses getting beaten up. And then I have like my nice pairs is from Louvay. That's like more design design driven. I I don't know. I'm just I've always been like I want to buy the thing from the company that makes that the expertise is the thing. Sometimes I deviate, but but that's my that's my thing. This has been so fun. And we will be back shortly with the rumor of the week.

Welcome back to Fashion People. Jess, OK, so this week's rumor, there were many to choose from. But I thought the most fun thing to talk about would be the fate of Kim Jones, who is the menswear designer, Dior, the women's wear designer at Fendi. And for the last, for the last, like, I don't know, two years, there have been all the things that I've been doing. All the speculation of was he going to take over Dior in its entirety? Was he going to leave Fendi, which he replaced Carl Lagerfeld when Carl Lagerfeld died on the women's wear? But there was there were the rumors that Alessandro McKaylee was going to come and design the whole thing. And then that didn't happen. And this past week, I wrote a bunch about some executive stuff happening behind the scenes at LVMH and the Fashion Group. And what kept coming up with people I talked to was sort of what was happening with Kim Jones. And I had heard that he was renegotiating his Fendi contract. And then someone messaged me on Friday and said, oh, he's definitely out. I heard it from someone on his team. And then another person messaged me. He was really close with him and said, that's not true. He's he's still there. I'm just curious. You've been covering the fashion industry for what, like five or six years now. And what is your impression of Kim Jones? What do you think his sort of his sort of mark has been at these two big jobs before this? He was the menswear designer at Louis Vuitton. And like, what what do you think is going to happen knowing, knowing everything? In the times that I have interviewed Kim, like a meaningful interview, not not just sort of a backstage high of I thing. It's actually always been about other designers who he has supported or mentored. And I think he's really good at that. And he seems to really like bringing on guest designers and collaborating. And part of that is because of just how many collections he he does oversee. But part of it is also that he's a good eye for what people want to buy and a taste for incubating talent, I think. Maybe this is far out, but actually to tie it back to the start of our conversation, what I would like to see is an expansion of the LVMH Prize Program, which is sort of like the best of the best award for young designers right now into a more substantial incubation program. And I think that Kim should play a major role in it. Like he's been in this business for so long, he understands how to navigate it. This industry needs to do more as we were discussing to help emerging young, smaller designers and who need more than just, I think, prize money and nominal mentorship. And I don't think that can come from fashion schools. And I say that because it sounds like I'm encouraging him to be like a dean of a college or something. That's not quite right. But I could see like I could see them creating a new role for him in this vein. I don't know. What do you think? Yeah, I'm like, wait, I don't care about that stuff at all. Like I don't, I think I just went to SCAD and I wrote about it in my newsletter yesterday and I'm going to, I talked about it a bit at the top of this show, but I'm, you know, everybody needs to pursue their dream. But anyone who is trying to be a fashion designer right now, it's completely insane. So like, I don't, I don't think they should be encouraging it more. And here's the thing. I understand what you're saying. I think you're 100% right that he is an incredible merchandiser. And he also, I mean, they all have a big ego, but he, he can't, he must have some sort of measured sense of self in that he is comfortable collaborating with all these people because it's not just supreme and skim. Right? It works for a thing, if it is a朝 or a week evenly designed or kim Zero and sponsored by the look at Dior men, which he just changed it from Dior home to Dior men, whatever. But the product itself, like the bags and the bar jackets and things, that stuff, he did it. He's done an incredible job with it. I could see him wanting all of Dior, which I think that like a lot of these designers who are really, really good, they want the whole thing. They don't want to just do one part. They want to control the whole vision. Dior is a complicated beast. And I had heard in November of last year that he was maybe going to Givenchy, that he had been like putting out requests to outside agencies for different projects. But again, it's all rumor speculation. One person says one little thing or one little meeting happens and it goes everywhere. I do think it's odd that both his men's, I don't know what season, but he was supposed to do a men's show in China. And then Fendi Couture I heard is also not happening. And so two shows from two different of his brands have been postponed or delayed or not happening. I do think that's weird. And if he doesn't make some sort of move, I would be really shocked. But I think you're exactly right. And not to be like evil about the kids stuff. I agree. I think that LVMH Prize, I went to it. It was really interesting. And the designers that were there this past season were incredible. But I think that he's good. And he probably has another 10 years of something. But my sense is that it's time for that something to be a new thing. And that he will move on. I mean, he will move on. They all move on eventually. But I could see it happening in like the next two months or so. It depends on if Hedim Salman is leaving Celine, there's going to be like a lot of movement within that group. There's already movement with the executives behind the scenes. But there could be like a designer domino situation. But who knows? Then again, he might be there for five more years at both of the companies. And we'll all be like, why were we all speculating about this one? It never happened. And that's what I think. When I try to picture where would I be excited to see him? It's just none of the houses that exist right now really trigger any emotional response for me. It's more like, it would be cool to see him do something like what Heider was just announced last week is doing. And joining a more non-traditional, non-luxury fashion brand, but bringing that sensibility to it, I think that could be exciting. It's just the musical chairs aspect of that luxury fashion tier feels less intriguing like thinking about where he would go next. Yeah, I think you mentioned Heider Ackerman who was just announced Creative Director of Canada Goose. And I think you're right. I mean, is it a bummer that Heider Ackerman isn't making high-end fancy clothes because he's so skilled at it? Yes. But is it cool that he's going to make stuff that a lot of people can buy? Yes. And I think that's a good way to put it. The thing about fashion is we, and this kind of brings us back to the Marr Hoffman thing. There are such specific measurements of success and failure. And there are all different ways that you can be successful. And sometimes success is leaving. And look at Helmut Lang. He's never coming back. And he's still the most successful, one of the most successful designers ever because he left when it was time for him to leave. And you see this a lot with Margiela is another example of that. And sometimes these design Dries Van Noten, yes, he's going to do his goodbye show in June. I'm going. I'm so excited. I'm not going to be going to many shows during June, but I am going to go to that one. And sometimes these people need to just walk away. And I have a feeling Kim Jones has a lot more to give. He seems like a pretty practical person with incredible output. But I hope that, I think you're right. I hope that he does something different next. And maybe it is that he's the Dean of Central Saint Martin's fashion school or whatever. Maybe we'll see. You'll be here. Well, I'll be here. We'll be watching it. Yeah. Jessica, this was so fun. I hope I see you in New York soon or next time you're here for a longer period. Thanks, guys. Fashion People is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck News, hosted by Lauren Sherman.
