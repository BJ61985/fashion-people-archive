Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Puck's fashion and beauty email line sheet. And today with me on the show is Becky Malinsky, fashion editor, stylist, writer, and author of the world famous shopping newsletter, Five Things You Should Buy. We discussed the business of sub-stack, what it was like to be a denim editor. Yep, that job actually existed and much, much more. This was a fun one, so let's get started. Hey everyone, happy Friday. I am in New York for a very, very short amount of time. Last night I went to the Hermes show. You'll have a report on that from me on Monday in the line sheet. And I got here on Wednesday afternoon, landed, basically started getting texts that Virginia Beard, 30-year veteran of Chanel, who's been the creative director for the last five years since Carl Lagerfeld passed, was leaving the business. I tried to confirm it. I confirmed it with another person. It just seemed it seemed like it needed to happen, but also how could this definitely be true? While I was thinking that for five minutes, the news broke and I got scooped, which is a little bit of a bummer. I never liked that, but I was able to do a bunch more reporting on sort of what's going on behind the scenes there. And it's interesting, essentially the Chanel statement said, we're good, the studio team can handle designing collections, which is definitely true. All these people have worked there forever. They're going to do couture on June 25th. It's fine. We will announce a new creative organization soon. But what I've heard talking to executives, former current employees, and also just like a lot of people who have talked to Virginia, people who have talked to other people within the business, is that Lena Nair, who's the global CEO, she came from Unilever. She ran like HR there for many years for like 30 years. She's she's like a real exec. She has had a lot of success at Chanel, the worth-einers like her, and she is going to sort of reorganize the business overall. She really wants to stop the business is split into beauty, fine watches and jewelry, and then fashion. So ready to wear accessories, couture, shoes, handbags, all that stuff. And she doesn't want those businesses to be so siloed. And so I think there's going to be a bit of a reorganization within the business as well. And, you know, all of this stuff could be announced by the time you listen to this. All of it could be announced in months. And I'm sure a lot of it will also happen behind the scenes that most of us won't won't really be privy to. But something bigger is happening than just Virginia leaving. As for who is getting her job, I don't even want to speculate here because you could listen to this on Monday and it be announced. But who I want to get it is Hedy Slumman. I think he's truly the only person who is capable of managing a business of that size. And Chanel is unique compared to especially a lot of the Dior Louis Vuitton in that it is a giant brand. It's almost as big as Louis Vuitton. It's bigger than Hermes, but it has a very consistent point of view. There's not like a Dior Louis Vuitton. You have different kinds of campaigns. You have different designers designing men's and women's and jewelry and all this stuff. And so the aesthetic is it's less about having one aesthetic and more of a state of mind where Chanel is about the aesthetic and Hedy is about the aesthetic. He's a great product designer. He can do it. He can make this brand feel. I hate this word, but relevant. He is the right person. He he is sort of old fashioned in the way he works, but he knows how to bring relevance to everything, which is sort of how Carl Lagerfeld was. If you've ever read the book, A Beautiful Fall by Alicia Drake or Alicia Drake, maybe I don't know. I've never asked her how she pronounces her first name. But the thing that she says about that it's about Saint Laurent and Carl Lagerfeld in the seventies, essentially. And what she says about Saint Laurent is he was, you know, a couturier. He was a designer and Carl Lagerfeld is also a designer, but he's a stylist or however you would say it in French. He is really about the concept. And so Hedy is similar. He can design the heck out of anything, but it's really about understanding how it all fits together. So that's my pick. I have no idea what's going to happen there. All these rumors about Jeremy Scott as I'm recording this. I don't know. He was very close to Carl Lagerfeld also, but I my my pick is is Hedy Salman. We will see. I did message someone from Celine and said, are you working at Chanel now? And they said they haven't gotten a call. So we'll see if they're listening to this. I doubt they are. You're the best. I really like you. Anyway, today at Becky Malinsky on who's a good friend of mine, she's a fashion editor. She writes the sub stack newsletter called five things you should buy. It is the biggest, if not the biggest, one of the biggest shopping newsletters out there. She's brilliant. She worked so hard and it was really fun to talk about her career and also how she made a business out of writing a newsletter every week. It's much harder than you think. And she put so much work on into it. And so I'm so happy to have her on. Otherwise, Alex Wang show, I didn't go. I was at dinner with my friends at Odeon and it was just so hilarious. Like every single person in the world walked by the fashion industry was like at Odeon on Wednesday night. But a couple of people walked by and they said, oh, we just went to Alex Wang and they were showing me pictures. I really wish I knew it was happening. But I was like, I don't need to go. Which I am glad I didn't go. But because I wanted to hang out with my friends and you need to do that sometimes. But it looked amazing. Like he had Dennis Rodman walk the show. There were models splayed out in tanning beds. It looked outrageous. I think Alexander Wang, I think the redemption tour is done. I think he is back. Let's see if people start wearing the clothes. And when I say people, I mean fashion people. Let me know what you think. Loving all these texts and emails, so much feedback. The feedback loop is just on fire. It's been so fun. And I hope you have a great weekend and I'll talk to you next week. Let's get started with Becky. Becky Malinsky, thank you for being on Fashion People. Pleasure. So first of all, I just want to tell you that I did return that red shirt. OK, yeah, for the best. It was for the best. The sleeves. It's cute, but I feel like I want to wear it with a jacket, probably. And you can't wear that with a jacket. And if you have to think about it too much, you just won't wear it. Yes. OK, that's the best advice. First question of the day, what did you have for breakfast? Hmm. How specific do you want it? Very specific. OK, I had toast, two slices of toast, one with peanut butter, one with raspberry jelly. And it is this bread for all you New York fresh direct New Yorkers. It's like a white crustless bread that is so delicious and so ridiculous that I have white bread and jelly for breakfast. But highly recommend. It is white bread having a comeback is a question. Because last week, Mickey Drexler, he he eats wheat, but he eats his bread. They sl they like slice each slice for him thinner. Oh, I don't know. I just have a young kid. And so it is this like a milk bread or something. It's OK. So I actually looked at the brand recently. It was this, you know, so my son, you know, let's start out with TMI. He has crazy food allergies. So we have to buy everything really packaged so I can read all of the labels. And so that usually means bread that is like so overly processed. But I found this packaged bread fresh direct that has only seven ingredients. It's like the freshest possible packaged bread you could buy. And it happens to be a white crustless bread. So it seems to be like the freshest packaged option. And it's white bread. So do you remember the name of it? The brand is La Bre Oche, but split up. OK. Yeah. Well, I'm really happy for you. Thank you. That's interesting. That's I'll I'll check it out. I'm not really I'm more of a sourdough. Oh, delicious. I mean, I love I do not discriminate. I love all forms of bread. Yeah, I had. An egg with. All of sourdough toast. Wow. Wow. So good from Julie. We went to this. Well, so I also live in a house with food allergies with a partner who is celiac. Yeah, which is extremely annoying. I have my own separate toaster. And so we went to Juicda last weekend for breakfast and I bought a loaf of the olive sourdough. And then what I do so it doesn't go bad or I don't eat like an entire loaf in one sitting or not that I do that. But, you know, I slice it up and then I put it in the freezer. And in the mornings when I eat breakfast, which is most days, I like slice one piece or one for me and the kid. And have it with eggs. But the olive sourdough is really good. I'm I'm big into I think bread is great. It's it's my favorite for sure. Yeah, everyone else. Becky, I wanted to have you on the podcast to talk about sort of talk about the business of newsletters. And as I think, you know, I'm less interested in people's journeys generally, because you can go on how I built this in two years and talk about that. Sure. But I thought it would be interesting. You and I have been friends for a long time, but I'd say we became better friends during the pandemic when you couldn't see anyone in person anyway. And so we texted a lot. And so I was sort of with you in this transition from being a very traditional fashion editor to running your own newsletter and your own publication, essentially, and then also building this other business and becoming a superstar. In the world of not only fashion and influence and Instagram, but also in the world of newsletters, you were your sort of the top echelon of these sub-stack people. So I wanted to talk to you about a bunch of that stuff. Maybe we could start, though, not not to go too deep. But but I'm sure you have some funny stories about like how you got into fashion. You were a market editor. What the heck is a market editor? I know. Oh my God. I was actually joking with someone recently who, you know, I always say I'm like the last surviving market editor, which of course is obviously not true. But there are a few of them left. But I was joking with some of the other day. I was like, remember when it was my whole job to cover denim? You know, oh my God, was that a glamour? A glamour. I mean, it wasn't the whole job, but there was a time in my life where I was going to denim trade shows twice a year and I could I could name every fit and wash of Jean from every Jean brand and tell you how it fits and what size you should buy. And so a market editor back in the olden days when magazines had big mastheads was the person or team who was responsible for bringing the product into the magazine. So knowing what was, I mean, I guess in the market. This was a time when you produced everything three to four months before it hit stores. So you basically had to do the shopping for everyone before it was available. And this is sort of very early days of e-commerce. So people were shopping in a very different way too. So it was your job to go to the fashion shows, but also go to showrooms two to four times a year and know what was happening from everyone. At Target and American Eagle and and Taylor up to, you know, the European designer brands and what was coming out and where were the trends and where were the similarities and differences and how do you get the exclusive and guarantee the piece? And it was kind of a crazy job. You had to be a diplomat. You had to, you know, you had to work with the stylists who really wanted something. You had to work with the brands who really wanted something. You really had to speak all of these languages and be able to manage all of that. Was there a surprising, was there ever like a piece of denim, like a pair of jeans that became a big phenomenon that the minute you tried them, you were like, these are going to be the thing or from that era, like a surprising moment in denim history that you track? Yeah. Well, I mean, there was the era of J brand. I covered denim during the era of J brand and the J brand Maria, which was, you know, the high-waisted skinny jean that like was the jean for a very long time. I still think everyone should own a black skinny jean, even if they're not trendy. It's winter and you're going somewhere cold and you need to pull a boot up or you're going at night and you have a long black jacket. You know, everyone needs a black skinny jean. So RIP, the J brand Maria, but there was that. And I was also a denim editor at the time. When brands were making their transition from stretch denim back to non-stretch denim and how much of a fight that was, you know, at magazines, we were very early adopters of wanting non-stretch denim and the denim brands were still heavily invested in stretch. And so trying to actually help coax that transition, you know, I remember going to the trade shows and meeting with this brand and saying, well, what do you have in non-stretch or will you make a pair in non-stretch? And can we produce maybe just a few so we could feature it? And guiding that. There's a lot of negotiation. There's a lot of negotiation. But now stretch is sort of coming back a little. Yeah, I know. Weird. Do you feel like the stretch now is better material than it was in 2012 or whatever? I mean, probably not. It's about percentage of stretch in the jean. And I think, you know, a stretch jean will stretch out and then, you know, it has that flexibility where it comes and goes and comes and goes. And so it stretches out quite quickly and that becomes frustrating to people when they're used to non-stretch jeans really molding to their body and a stretch jean will change. Sometimes that's nice. You know, you can wash it and then feel really tight and snug as you want to. But I think it's just like it's a mindset shift if you're going from stretch to non-stretch jeans. Yeah. Back really quickly back to the black skinny jean. I agree. And you know who else is obsessed with this is Tina Che. And I believe she wears. She's got great taste. I believe she wears the black, black frame skinny and it doesn't because the main issue with black jeans and we've discussed this is that they lose their color. Yes. Like I am actually wearing black skinny jeans right now. I'm wearing a pair from Ray that are like mid-waste. I mean, they get them while you can look fine. Yeah, exactly. RIP Ray, but these I've had forever. They're non-stretch, but like they're basically gray now. And so I bought a pair from feel and apparently they, they have don't have stretch, but apparently they, they, there's something in the copy that said they specifically designed them so they don't lose a lot of color. I haven't washed them yet either. I don't wear them. They're really tight on me. Yeah. I'm going to lose a little color. I mean, also wash uncle, don't dry, you know, do what you can to protect the color if you really are focused on that jet black, but they're all going to lose it a little bit. Yeah. So this sort of expertise is what makes you special is that you know all the stuff. Well, why did you want to be in fashion in the, in the first place? What, what drew you to that industry? You're, you're a very, um, methodical put together. You could have done a lot of different things, but you picked this. So why, why? Yeah, I don't know. I was always going to be a doctor, you know, like my family, interesting. This is our daughter. She's going to be a doctor. Um, my mom actually pushed me into it. I've all my entire life. I've been extremely opinionated about fashion and what I wear and what other people should wear and I've always loved the hunt. Even when I was a kid, um, and my mom actually encouraged me. She said, you know, this is something you should maybe consider this. I came to New York. I actually, my sophomore year of college, my boyfriend broke up with me and my, my older cousin was in New York in law school and my aunt was going to visit him for the weekend and my boyfriend had just broken up and she said, come with me to New York for the weekend. She, you know, get away from it all. So I came with, and my cousin's roommate's girlfriend was a market editor at Cosmopolitan magazine. Who? Her name was Brooke. And you don't, you don't know her. This is like, this is like 25 years ago and her name is Brooke Lux. She does not work in the industry anymore, but love you, Brooke. Um, and she said, oh, come to New York for the summer, be my intern. And so I did. And so, and then my mom said, if you have a garage sale of everything in the basement, you can take that money and go to New York for summer, live in the dorms, use the money, go do what you want. So I convinced my grandparents to help me like sell my entire basement. And like, I went to New York. Did you live in the NYU dorms? Yes, I lived in the NYU dorms. And then I did that one. You did? Oh, so disgusting. I can't believe people. Oh, I did really nice ones. Oh, my was like, Greenwich, Greenwich Avenue. No, I don't have that building that Monica Lewinsky used to live in. Oh, funny. Now mine definitely had like mold on the ceiling of the bathroom. Mine was really nice. And I, I roomed with a bunch of girls who were in Ivanka, Trump's sorority at Penn. They were really nice. Oh my God. Amazing. Yeah, it was fun. It was, it was, I do keep in touch with them and hear where, where is she now? No, I don't think they're friends. They were, this was a thing of like my college friends from Emerson. And these girls, and it was not people who would probably hang out typically. But they were really nice. And it was totally fine. But I know I don't remember. I honestly, I barely remember my actual friends names from college. It's, it's all blur. But I don't, but I do remember. And it was when Monica Lewinsky, because this would have been 2003, I think. It was when Monica Lewinsky was living in this building. And there was a, um, dog, a stenos in it. And it was the, the dorms were right next to this building. And there was, it's by the printing press gym. Yeah. That whole area. And I interned at this quote, quote unquote, interned at a store in Williamsburg. And like worked on the other days. I sold, um, I sold tickets to the Syracuse season tickets to the Syracuse symphony orchestra in like a room. The things we did, things we did to get here. But yes, but I think for me, I always love fashion, but I'm not of this world. And I didn't even know that these kind of jobs existed. So, you know, it was like, you like fashion, you grew up in Minnesota. You like fashion, you're going to be a designer. But so anyway, I went to New York, I had this internship. I loved it. I was like, this is what I got to do. This is where I'm meant to be. And then I just did everything in my power to get back there. And I came back the next two summers and then I moved to New York with no job and took meeting with everyone and anyone who would meet with me. And, um, and then the assistant job became available at Lucky. And I was like, you want to lucky to. Yes, you worked. Oh my God. That's where everybody worked a lucky. Everybody worked at lucky to. That's how we met. Do that. Yeah. And we're talking about Ali Pugh, who is another old school market editor who was most recently fashion director at Goop. And she works at culture now and does a bunch of, she has a great newsletter too. And does a bunch of cool stuff and you two are best friends. And sometimes I infiltrate the conversation. But yes. So that job became available. And I was like, I will get this job if this is the last thing I do. And I remember I like, you know, stayed up all night at Kinko's, like making a trend book of like runway images, copy and pasting in a three ring binder and brought it with. And I was like, here's a seasonal trend report. And they loved it so much. They were like, can we keep this? Oh, and like you're hired. Um, was it hope? Was it hope Greenberg or hope Greenberg and Annie? Oh, and Keen, she's so great. I worked there for a year. I don't think I don't remember if hope actually worked there when I worked there. Julia Kulich. I never came for no. It's genetic. Kulich, Nikov was there. And Anne and Alexis Brian Morgan. And I remember like the third day because I had never worked in a fashion magazine, but I loved, I loved lucky and was like, yeah, I would like to work here. These women seem very smart. And Alexis was like, you could not work at another one. She was like, this is not for you. And I was like, yeah, you're probably right. I mean, I just remember I was like, I can't believe these people behave this way generally. And that was a nice. Yeah, it was like, and they weren't bad there. I've worked at a lot of places. I had just come from like not that. And so I was like, why is everyone acting like this? And also playing the fashion department. They were always playing some game. Like they were all playing some game on their computer. And I was like, how do you all have time to play that? I forget what it was. It was a big team. It was even when I was there. It was and I was there later than you, obviously. But yeah, no, I mean, lucky. It still breaks my heart that lucky is did not become like the best e-commerce platform. You know, it was like it was a time it was before everything was 10 years late with lucky. So lucky should have started in 1990 or 1980. And then it would have had 30 years. Kim Francis, I was just actually emailing with her about something. She was brilliant. It was a great magazine. I loved it. I was I should have never worked there. Like it's it's it's not right for me to work there, but I love consuming it. I worked there when Brandon Holly was editor. But by the time I got there in 2011, they were like, we're going to do e-commerce. And I was like, you guys don't even have a you can't even upload a story appropriately. They were using this goofy CMS that was Adobe. And I was like, this is a joke. I don't understand this magazine is going to fold. I was I at one point I was like, should I stay to get the severance when it folds? And thank God I didn't because when it folded, no one got severance. Right. Because I'm glad by that. Yes. And no one got no one got their severance. The people had worked there for like 10 years. Really bad. But yes. But yeah, it was if they had. But I mean, none of the e-commerce sites ended up working either. But at the time when you looked at like when I started in 2011, that was like Netaporte was on a rocket ship and they also had a cool magazine. And it was like, damn, if they had tried to do that, I'm not the stuff they tried to do when I worked there, there was a digital PDF and they have little they wanted people to scan these barcodes to shop the PDF. And I was like, no, what's going to do this, people? And I was I was the executive editor of the website or whatever. And I just remember going into I've told this story way too many times, but going into I had to meet with these people named Mariko and Heather Hamilton. And they were they were responsible for subscriptions. And I remember being in a meeting with them and they were like, the website traffic is up like a thousand percent since you started because I had a big team and we used to blog the shit out of everything. And they were like, but the print subscriptions are increasing. And I was like, no, that's not going to happen. I felt so bad for them. I forget what that department was called. It was funny. But yeah, it everyone who worked there is awesome. And yeah, like it's too bad because it had all the right ingredients and it just wasn't the right time or something. Yeah. Yeah. Which is so helpful for kids who are still learning how to brush. Bokeh's and hot toothpaste comes in delicious flavors like element and lemon, lavender for adults and orange cream and strawberry mango for kids. All flavors are free from SLS, endocrine disruptors and parabens. Bokeh is the number one children's toothpaste on Amazon with over 40,000 five star reviews for a limited time. Bokeh is offering parents like you and I 15 percent off on Amazon and at Bokeh.com with code her health 15. That's her health 15. Make the switch to Bokeh for the whole family today at BOK.com. Really quickly, because again, I don't want to go this to see about your totally your resume. But so did you go from there to glamour and then to the journal or where else were you? I went from there to GQ. So I was there in 2008 when McKinsey came in and. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Basically, GQ was really protected from a lot of the cuts that everyone else had. And they were the only place that got to keep their assistants on staff. And I was, of course, like a type A dorky star assistant. So I was moved to I had like technically gotten laid off from lucky. And so they offered like I got moved to GQ. So I was a sittings assistant there. And then from there, I went to glamour and I was the American market editor at glamour for many years, which, you know, glamour was at the time, the biggest circulating women's magazine in the country. So the American market was very important. So I like to think it was very important. So that was kind of an intense job. And from there, I went to the Wall Street Journal. What was it like working for Cindy Levy? Cindy was great. You know, she was enthusiastic and a very positive person. And I. You know, I had an important market. I think I got to have a lot of FaceTime with her because I did cover those brands that were important to the mass market. And so, you know, we would go on a lot of appointments together. And it was always like my pages were important because it was getting the pieces for less, which is a funny thing. But, you know, it really was my job to be able to find those diamonds in the rough because we're creating these beautiful well stories like every other magazine. But then we're also, you know, trying to create like actionable, serviceable stories for women. So it was my job to really find the expensive looking pieces that are attainable for the masses. So, but other than that, my interactions with her were very limited because I was, you know, part of a very big market team. I was not writing cover stories. Did you think that, do you think that you're that, your responsibility to the reader at that magazine where you had to show them how to look good without spending a lot of money has kind of shaped your whole way, your whole view of fashion? That's a good question. I mean, yes and no. It was a very important experience. You know, I had to go and look and touch and feel clothes and find the best in the masses. And so to really be able to determine what is good and what is not good and filter that out, that is something I learned there. I'm very grateful for that. But I would actually say my time at the journal probably was more influential in that and being able to give people the why and be able to explain fashion in a way where fashion was not the everything. Influenced that more. Yeah. So the journal job and you were fashion, fashion market director at the journal, right? So you ran this section called off duty, which I actually wrote for. And that's probably where we, we met, right? I think that's where we probably got to know each other better. Yes. And I, when I was a freelancer, that was like my favorite that and B of were like the combo where my, that was basically my job. I would do anything off duty. Yes. It was very top down. So I didn't pitch a ton of stories, but I got assigned a lot, which was great. And then I did a lot for B of and then I ended up going to B of full time in the, my last. We were sad about that thing was off duty. I was really sad. I loved, I loved freelancing for, for me know who she, she comes up a lot. She's truly one of the best. Uh, but I, I just loved that. That was a circumstance where I was a big fan of the section. And I actually made sense in it. Uh, but it was great because it wasn't the thing is the Wall Street Journal consumer or the reader is affluent. So they have money, but they are the kind of people to be like, don't fucking give me, I don't, I'm not spending this money. Well, I can't believe you asked me to spend this money. So funny describing that. Um, so what was that? I think, see, I think that is, that is sort of my whole thing is. Well, one, the journal was very good training in that you had to really defend your idea and be the why, because you are one small subset of a reader's day. You know, they're reading about a lot of different things, even an off duty fashion was two pages and then there was travel and food and wine and cars. So it was not just sheer as the trend. And here are the five sheer looks. It was, you know, if I pitched that to Dale, aren't my editor at the time, you know, it would be like, well, why, we love. Listen to this shout out to Dale, shout out to Dale, one of the best top editors of all time. I learned so much from him. Um, he, you know, it would have to be, well, why is sheer the trend and how is she supposed to wear that? And when was it a trend before and what's the historical reference and where are you planning on shooting this and what do the models look like? And so it was, you had to really be able to defend an idea and know how to explain it to someone who is not a fashion first person. Um, but someone who is a smart person and someone who has money to spend. So to me, it's sort of, I always want to assume that the reader is smart. And I always want to be able to explain that fashion is for them. And it's my job to be able to translate that. And the journal made me be able to do that in a clear and concise way. What always blew me away about that section. And as someone who writes about fashion, but also writes about fashion media. And I was obsessed with this when I was freelancing was what the, I don't think I've told the story on this podcast. So I can, can say it, but I did a story for me. No once it was over the holidays. It was about like the best men's T-shirt and she told me which ones I didn't get to have any say it was like, I would do all that market. And then we would be like, and interview these three people. Yeah. I'm in LA six months later. I meet up with Sasha and Eric from Buck Mason. I'd never met them before. And they're, I think it was Michael Williams works with them. I think it was probably Michael was like, can, can you meet with them? I was like, sure, whatever. And they are like, that T-shirt story changed our business. They said that there were people calling them saying, I don't have the internet. Can I cut this out of the paper? Can I give you my credit card on the phone to get the T-shirt? And then I have lunch with them. Probably it was right before I started at Puck because I remember I really wanted to tell them I was going to Puck and I couldn't. And they brought it up again and they were like, you don't understand. And now they have like, they've done an amazing job. They haven't raised that much money or I don't maybe not even. I think they've raised a little bit, not a lot, but they've just they have a great business and I'm endlessly impressed, way more impressed by them than I was back then. But you obviously saw something in them. And also the reader just really trusted that audience. It was always the papers. Like I remember browsing was another with New York time styles. That section also converted a lot. But off duty, it was special because it wasn't exactly what you're saying. Like it there was a real story and you didn't feel like it was BS. It felt and it was really fun to read and you have an amazing eye. So the the stuff in it was like good and people would go nuts for. I remember our mutual friend and my best friend of like 20 years, Emmy Parsons saying she has a sandals line. I think you had were one of the first credit she ever gotten. It was such a big thing for her business. It's really remarkable. And I wonder now, like 10 years later, if those kinds of things still have the same impact on sales or not as the like culture of consumption of media has changed. Yes. Well, I mean, it's a it's a focused audience. They're not scrolling their phone while they're looking at the paper. I mean, that's it's the same sort of feeling I tried to give with my newsletter actually to it's, you know, it's it's edited down. It's focused. There is a bit of a story a while behind it. But yeah, I still get people, you know, I still have those conversations with people who will be like, remember when you focus my bag or my new shoe? And and it like it's so mean so much. It makes me feel so good that I could have that impact. And the journal, of course, you know, at a very strict ethics policy, we had ethics training twice a year. We, you know, I feel so grateful that I was able to have that. And I was able to be very defensive in the market and have to really use that I and focus that I at a time when, you know, like Instagram and social media rise. I was really I was a fly on the wall during all of that in a time and working at a place that was a very old school newspaper during all that. So I really watched the change kind of background. And now you're in the middle of everything. So you decided to leave the journal. It was like this. Was it the summer of 2020? So no, summer 2022 is the summer I actually left. I had been talking about it like I had been starting to talk to my editor in sort of the very early spring of 2022 about leaving. And I left in June of 2022. OK. And so you are like, I'm going to leave. Why did you you were there for seven years? Correct. So you have this amazing job. Everybody's jealous of your job. This is one of these jobs and there are very few of them, but people get real jealous. They like or like, I'm jealous of your and everybody is kind of is nice to you, but hate you because you have a good job. I remember talking about this with an editor at T Magazine and she was like when I worked at B of everybody's kind of annoyed you like it's the journal job is was a prime job. And you got to go to Europe for Fashion Week. You got amazing access to people. People loved the product. Why did you decide to leave and what was your plan when when you left? Yeah, I mean, I loved my job. I could have stayed there till I died happily. I was challenged. It was wonderful. I left in the spring of 2022. I just. Well, I left to start a totally different business. So I'm sure you remember because it wasn't that long ago that when everyone started going back to work in offices and there was so much conversation about going back to work in an office and around what to wear and office dress codes changing that that spring of 2022. It's all anyone was talking about. Office dress codes are changing and everyone wants to be comfortable and people were taking pictures cutting off ties. And every podcast I listened to was talking about it. I remember listening to a podcast. It was I think it was the Harvard Women at Work podcast. I loved that podcast. I don't even know if it's on anymore, but I remember one of the hosts saying, you know, she's like the editor of the Harvard Business Review. Like it's a brilliant woman. She's like, I have this full closet of clothes and I don't know what to wear. And I just had this light bulb moment that like, well, I know what you should wear. And I was like, I can help people with this. And this seems like it's a business and I could do this. And if I want to start this business, I have to do it right now because this is when everyone's talking about this. And so I kind of don't know what came over me, but I left my job and I decided I was going to launch this executive styling business and I was going to help people with their work wardrobes and really just be a stylist for people, public facing executives in their everyday wardrobe. You know, I don't do weddings. I don't do bar mitzvahs, but I was going to help people with their work wardrobe. And it was also, I guess, backing up. It was also a time when all of a sudden everyone was public facing in a way that they weren't pre COVID, you know, everything was on Zoom. Every, you know, people were going to panels. People had to be in video. And so there was a lot of emphasis on appearance in a way that I think people could get away with before without really having to have that sort of look, having a look at a time when it was very confusing to get dressed. So I decided I was going to leave my job and start this business because again, it was a new, I couldn't do them both at the same time. So I left my, I decided I was going to leave my job to start this business. I did start that business. And at the same time, I also recognize that working with private individuals can be challenging and not always the most creative thing. So, you know, you kind of a client who will only wear sleeves and it doesn't matter if every single dress in the entire market is sleeveless, like you are going to find the thing with sleeves for that person. So I wanted to have a creative outlet for myself. I wanted to have something also to keep me on a schedule. I was used to publishing four stories a week and I'm a type A person. And I was, you know, launching a business on faith. I didn't know if I was going to be busy. So I decided, oh, I'm going to start this newsletter just for me. Just to keep myself on a schedule, just to keep my ear to the ground and make sure I'm still paying attention to what's really going on. You know, maybe my mom will read it. And, and here we are. I'm running both businesses now, simultaneously. And what happened with the newsletter? What happened? What happened with the newsletter? It became a phenomenon. It became the biggest fashion sub-stack. I mean, maybe it's not officially the biggest. It's one of the biggest, but it is everyone I know reads it. And I, you, you and I have a lot of weirdly connected mutual friends like Hannah Fidel, who is a director. Yes. Fidel or Fidel? Fidel. Fidel. Yeah. Oh, sorry. My sister's college. We make Hannah. Yeah. So Hannah is my mom's friend. But like all of Hannah's friends read it. They're all like, Becky Malinsky said this. And a lot of times they don't even know I'm front. We're you and I are good friends. So like it's, but it became so you start this newsletter. It's called five things. You're like, I'm only going to write once a week. It's going to be five things. And it just became, it became the new Lucky Magazine. It became the thing that people were like, I'm going to know how to dress. I'm going to know I'm going to learn how to shop. I'm going to learn how to what looks good on me. I'm going to learn what's in the market that I don't know about because Becky knows everything. And it was a part of this wave of sub stacks, including our other friend, Leandra Medine Cohen's sub stack cereal aisle, but Laura Riley's sub stack, Laurel Panton's sub stack. But you, Leandra, Leandra is interesting because she's sort of. You and her compliment each other like you could, if you two could have run a magazine together and it would have been she has your do you're coming at it from different directions, but like you were, you were the, you were the glamour magazine or the Lucky Magazine of this whole crew of people. And suddenly you were not just a market editor. You were, you were an influencer. You were public facing and you were like a part of this. All these articles about subs to the sub stack revolution, blah, blah, blah. You were in that conversation quite a bit of the time. And just curious, like, when did you realize it was a real thing? Was there a certain number of paid subscribers? Was it a certain number of subscribers generally? Was it the amount of emails you were getting back? When were you like, oh, shit, this is, this is real. I don't know if there was one particular moment. I mean, the, the growth has been pretty steady. There have been a couple of jumps. I was featured in the New York Times and the Sunday business section last summer. Shout out to Sapna. We love her. Yes. Go get back on the retail beat, Sapna. We miss you. As in the story about the changing face of women's media. And, you know, I was hesitant to even do the interview because I mean, I came from a newspaper. I'm a little scared of reporters and it's like, I don't know. But then I ended up having like a lovely conversation with her for, I think over an hour about, you know, what this is and that it's a business. And I think getting to explain it to her and then having it be in the business section and not like no offense Sunday styles. I love the Sunday styles, but like having this story be in the business section was a huge moment. Obviously, and that made me really feel like, OK, no, this is a business and I don't have, you know, when people ask me what I do, I don't really like, I write a shopping newsletter. It's like, I write a shopping newsletter. So, yeah, I think I guess that was a major moment. I think people were really supportive from the beginning, which was wonderful. And, you know, I was obviously you don't just quit your job after working for big companies in 20 years without any nerves. So I was definitely a little nervous. And, you know, it's a nerve racking to put yourself out there. You know, I'm working from my home now. And, you know, I don't have a big beast of a company behind me. So it is definitely nerve racking. So I think even from the beginning with people being really positive about it and posting it on Instagram and subscribing and sending it to their friends. And it was wonder that feeling has been wonderful since the beginning. The process of accepting insurance outside of a group practice can be tough.

I don't think it's evolved very much because you do, you are, you know what you like. You're a good editor. You don't need, you don't waver. What you started with and what you have right now is a great way to get started. What do you have right now? Three years, almost three years later. So I can tell you exactly how the concept came to be. At the same time I was leaving my job and trying to think what my creative outlet was going to be. I had a friend going back to work in an office. She had been laid off on maternity leave during COVID. And so this was, and she was going back to a new job, a creative job in a corporate company. So it was her first time going back to work since having a baby since COVID. And she called me one night and she said, I have been shopping online for jeans for three days and I am exhausted and I have no jeans. Will you just send me five things that I should buy for my new job and I'm just going to buy them? And I was like, oh, that sounds so fun. Sure. And I sent her a list of five things. I think it was a cute jean and a fun sneaker. You know, I don't actually remember what the list is. I think, I do think it is the first newsletter though, if you scroll all the way back. And I thought, oh my God, this is the newsletter. This is the whole point. There is too much and people are doom scrolling all night and there is so much fatigue around shopping online. And this is what I know how to do and I can do. And so that's what this is going to be. It's going to be the well edited place. And you know, every editor can tell you it's much harder to do less than it is to do more. It's much harder to write a description in 50 words than it is in a thousand. So like that was always the point, was to create the space for a reader to not feel overwhelmed and to feel excited and just, you know, have a very comforting space. So that was the initial concept. It was always, and then of course, the idea of five things is very flexible. It could be five white t-shirts. It could be, you know, five different types of weddings you have to go to and get dressed for. It's very malleable. So in that sense, it's a very flexible structure, but it's also very controlled and edited. So that's sort of why it is what it is. And that's also why it hasn't evolved much, because I do truly feel that more is not better. And so, you know, people ask me all the time, well, maybe you should do two new newsletters, like maybe twice a week, one for paid subscribers and one for all subscribers. And I just think I love the relationship I have with readers where they tell me, you know, I'm so excited to, you know, open it on Sunday mornings. And I think that feeling would not be there if it was more than once a week. Yeah, I agree. I don't, I have, when people are like, how do you do everything you do? I'm like, my issue is I do too much. Like I could just vomit out stuff every single day. Yes, like I have it. But I don't have that restrict. I have to really, you have a, one of your talents is the ability to restrain yourself. Rain it in. And also, like that's why I message you when I buy something, because you're usually like, no. Which whereas if someone asks me, I always say yes. So, or 99. I'm brutally honest. And that's the, and that was the other part of it. That was that sense of a place of trust. And I really wanted to create this online place where I have a lot, I think I have a lot of respect for the reader. I think she's smart. I'm really grateful she spends her time with me. I never want her to feel duped, you know. So that's also part of it too, that I wanted it to be a very honest place and a very edited place. Yeah. So you started this personal styling service at the same time. You're still doing that. But like what's the breakdown either in terms of like approximate revenue percentage or in terms of like your time that you're spending on the newsletter versus this other business. And also you also do consult, so different kinds of consulting work. Yes. I got a lot going on. That's how I like to be. Multiple revenue streams. That's the way you've got to be. Multiple, always multiple revenue streams. There's multiple revenue streams for each revenue stream even. So the styling business is probably a little less than half my time, but you know it's very intimate work and it's very time consuming work. So I would say it's only a quarter of my revenue, but it's really important work to me. So it's, and it also all the work kind of feeds each other. So you know, client work is very specific and you know I'm not styling for me. It's not what I like. I'm helping someone be their best self for what their job is. So it's very specific, but there will be a time when 10 clients in one month will ask me the same question and then obviously I know, oh this is a much bigger question and this is a question. Everyone must have this as a newsletter. If it's sort of I'm fighting and seeing a theme with clients. But also the working with people, I've met so many interesting people who are at the top of their field that I would have never crossed paths with otherwise. And you know, I was trying to think even before this podcast, like what about that breakdown? And earlier this year I had a client go to Davos and you know we worked on her wardrobe for the three days. And it's intense. It's an intense schedule. Like you don't have time to go back to your room for morning tonight. So we had to make all of these outfit plans and she sent me a text and that you know she is at dinner with an executive from a top luxury brand and she feels great about her outfit and like getting that text to me is just the best feeling. So that is like work that's very important, but it is revenue wise, not the biggest. Got it. But the breakdown is probably like maybe it's a third of my time with clients and then I spend a lot of time with the newsletter because it is weekly and I work really hard on it because I love it. It's a labor of love. And then the newsletter has three revenue streams, which do you want me to talk about? Yeah, please. So there's the subscription. Yeah. Revenue stream. There is an affiliate revenue stream and then there is a brand partner revenue stream. So I do very limited brand partnerships. But so there are three different. How do you choose who you've, so you've done stuff with Madewell, Levi's. Yeah. So the first two brand partners were Tori Birch and Levi's and I pitched them, I came to them and said, with very specific things. So Levi's is a brand that I you know wear and talk about all the time and I knew they were having a very big anniversary for the 501 last year so I came to them I said, hey, can we do a newsletter? Can we do a sponsored newsletter? And like big shout out to Levi's and Tori and thank you because you know they truly just had to believe in me because I had no template. I had nothing to show them. I was like, well, this is what I wanted to be and I have absolutely nothing to show you, but like I think it's going to be great. And they had to kind of take a chance on me and obviously they both, they both were incredibly successful. They both did very well and you know then, you know, other brands said, well, I want that. And so it was now it's sort of, I'm in a place where I will, I'm sort of thinking of it as I will do one a quarter because again, I don't want the newsletter to be a place that's ever watered down or feels like it's a place where people are just being sold stuff. So, you know, people do come to me and say, oh, can I pay you to put this thing in? And I'm just like, no. So it's, I'm going to be doing them between four to six times a year maybe, but it allows me to really pick the brands and for me to go to the brands that I feel like are brands that I'm talking about anyway, and I or have a good story or something that I really want to share with the reader. So that's kind of how I do it. And again, I pick them based on if it's something that I can truly authentically talk about. I have definitely had brands come to me and with them, like amounts of money that to me feel crazy to turn down, but that it's not real. And so it's that's so temporary. And, you know, I want readers to be able to trust me. So it has to be real. Yeah. And I've been through some of these processes on the outside with you and also the end result. And not that I'm reading tons of Sponkahn generally, but I do just think like you just do such a good job with them. It's crazy. Like they aren't. Thank you. It sometimes I am like, is it's I can't even, even though you're very obviously you say you're very upfront, you're very upfront and very transparent and you do all the legal things correctly. It doesn't feel like it doesn't feel fake. Like you said, and the thing is what I think a lot of these brands don't realize. And I've heard this talking to a lot of influencers, like pure people who are like, I remember the first time I was on a Carolina rare press trip with me is the best press trip I've ever been on. Press trip for Carolina. Areas to Spain for her like 50th anniversary or something. And they had an event at the Spanish ambassador, the U.S. Ambassador's house and everybody was wearing low. I've, it was so chic and Carolina rare, obviously, wiggly, but no, everyone was wearing low. I've a at the Carolina rare party. They were, they were, I mean, they were wearing low. I've a bags and maybe some dresses, but I mean, low is like really big in Spain because it is obviously it's like the and a lot obviously a lot of Carolina, Arara dresses, but it was me, Stelene, Eric Wilson, Arman. And that's it. It was the best pressure by I've ever been on. I had to thank you again to Emily, who's the CEO of Carolina rare for inviting me and Lauren, who is now at Lauren A. Street. Yes. Who is who is not Polo Ralph Lauren. She was still there. I had a great time. It was one of the last paid trips I ever did also. I, it was so great. But anyway, during that press trip, I remember because this was like probably 2016 or so. I met all these people. They had a lot of Middle East influencers there and they were with us because there are only four people from the U.S. Again, the best group of people ever. It was truly amazing. I'll never forget it. And this girl is just like, I said, oh, what do you do? You know, usually in the U.S. if you talk to an influencer, they're like, I'm an interior designer or I'm a model. They'll say I'm a model, whatever. This girl was like, I'm an influencer. And I also, this was when people were still using the word blogger and I was like, right, what is this person doing? Yes. But the point being that I've talked to a lot of them and the amount of control the brands want over the sponsored content is totally insane. And that's why it doesn't perform well because I think what a lot of brands don't realize and what you and other people and in some ways, me are trying to teach them is that if you let someone else give their point of view on your brand, it actually like helps your brand because it gives your brand, it makes your brand feel real. Like you're saying, instead of being this like manufactured thing. And so I, that is a very long tangent to say that I think you and Leandra and other people who are doing similar things to what you all are doing, when you do work with companies, it feels like it's coming from a place of, oh, I actually like this. And yes, I would like to get paid for my enjoyment of it since I make you all a lot of money by sending people to your website or to other people's website to buy your stuff. But like, you should have Uniqlo stock for that nylon banana pack. Yes. Well, I, yes, I think, I mean, listen, I've been doing this a very long time too. I've been in service journalism like 19 years. So I speak designer, but I also speak like in real people language. So I think I do, I do, I understand both needs and I think I am able to balance that. Yeah. So what do you think of this whole sub stack thing? Because you're a person, A, you're, you're, you're very individual. You have your own point of view. You don't seem like a person who wants to be like clumped together with other people. You liked, if, if everybody likes, like I was talking about the MES, I don't know, a picotine or whatever. Yeah, the picotin. Yeah. Like everybody. So sad. Everybody has it on the operating side. I think I'm still going to get, I need to, I want to get an air mess bag in the fall. The one of the more affordable ones, but we get, we'll talk about it, but, but the point being, you don't, you don't want to be clumped together with anyone. Like you're, so how has this whole like sub stack phenomenon, how have you felt? And like, what do you think, what, what do you see as someone who's in it, but also as a journalist and an observer view what's actually going on here? Yeah. I mean, I mean, sub stack is obviously very good at branding, right? Like they're like, they've become like the roller blades of new media. You know what I mean? Remember when it was like the debate of like inline skates or roller blades of Kleenex? Like it's all of a sudden become a sub step. But really what we're talking about is email as format. Like the same as what you do. So I think sub stack is great because they make it so easy. You know, I chose sub stack. I didn't actually do any research, I will admit, but like, you know, the barrier to entry is like knowing how to type. Like all of the backend is like completely set up for you and all the data collection is set up for you. And you pay for that. Obviously they take a percentage of, of your subscription revenue for that. But they do make it very easy. So in that sense, it's a great place. But yes, they are one brand. And this is just a different way of connecting with a reader that feels long form, but also intimate. Yeah. No, I love I love having this direct relationship with the reader. I sometimes I'm just like shocked at what a not kind place the comment section is. So for me, that's what's interesting is sort of the email as format. I definitely struggle at the moment with sub stack because they are like rolling out so many new features all the time. So now they have notes, which is like their Twitter, and then they have DMs and chat and like, I can't keep up with it and also produce a great story every week and be responding to all of that at the same time. So I'm very overwhelmed actually by it right now. But like, I also am very grateful that they make this very easy place for me to put it out there because at the end of the day, sub stack is just a blank canvas, like it's your job to create the content. And so it is kind of what I think it's wild how many there are now, but I also will be very interested to see how many there are I'm more interested in a year from now, what is this going to look like, because I'm already seeing people realize the amount of work that goes into it is something they can't keep up with. Like I've already seen people say, Hey, I'm going to take a write a note. I'm taking a step back, maybe pause your subscriptions or Hey, I'm back from an eight month hiatus. So I'm going to be the consistency is what's so important, I think in writing a newsletter. So 100%. I'll be very curious what this landscape looks like in a year. Once everyone who realized they just wanted to put their personal recommendations out there, probably doesn't want to keep up with it. Yeah, we talk a lot about consolidation versus fragmentation and in media, but in, I talk about it constantly in the fashion industry and industries consolidating, then they fragment, then they consolidate again. And looking at that's what's happened with Substack, like all these journalists, all these people, suddenly there aren't as many jobs and also you can go direct and make money direct and probably in most cases make more money. So what the natural thing to happen next would be like rollups of some of these things. And I'm not asking about you into because I also just as, as observer of you, if I didn't know you, my assumption would be this person wants to do their own thing and like they're not going to get rolled up into something else unless it's like really makes sense. But, but do you think that that's going to happen? Like do you think that there's going to eventually be a thing where like a bunch of these get rolled up and it is like a lucky magazine or a fast company? Like I've heard people talk about Emily Sumberg and Casey Lewis and should they do a rollup of their, of their work and maybe with one other, maybe with Dan Fromer from the new consumer. Or something, you know, that's super interesting. That's interesting. I'm sure everything is cyclical. I actually, I was just laughing. I just sent this article to Max because what is a fashion people podcast without mentioning Max? Max Dye article about I saw him last night at the Japanese wrestling circle from the New York times about how all of the streaming services are starting to have advertising. Oh yeah. And how, you know, it was this big promise of subscription model and we were going to save ourselves from advertising, but actually couldn't sustain itself. And it has to be this balance. So again, we're at everything is, it's sort of the same as that is like, okay, well, we're just, I'm sustaining myself on subscription model for me. But when people want to grow them, how are they going to find the revenue? I don't necessarily want to grow my newsletter. You know, people ask me about that. And I'm not actually sure I do. I love it right now. I don't, I don't know what's next. But obviously, I think that theory makes a lot of sense. I'm what I'm really interested is what you were talking about before talking about the brand partnerships and sort of that human element is, you know, like all that talk now about AI, I'm so obsessed with sort of this human element is going to be the thing that saves us all and it's going to be all that's left. So how do I just maintain that? Yes, I'm not totally sure about the business aspect of it. Yeah, I have, I'm a terrible delegator, so I can't even hire like a part-time assistant. So same. I mean, I don't, yeah, I am, I don't know about all that. It's just better if you do it yourself. Better if you do it yourself. I don't know. I'm sure that's not actually the answer if you want to scale, but I think this is a great point. I carried Diamond who used to be a beauty editor and then she worked at Lancome and then she ran Mac, ran restaurants and now runs Cherry Bomb, this food publication she started about women and food. She was just on this podcast that's a subset of this podcast. I love called print is dead long live print, which is dumb name, but I make fun of them too much. I need to stop, but it's called the full bleed. It's like, I don't, again, like this is crazy to me. These people are magazine editors. Why do you have to have a separate thing that they should have just called the whole thing the full bleed? That's a good name. And yeah, I don't understand why the why Kerry's episode, even though it's the same the same channel on podcasts that it's called the full bleed. I don't know, but Kerry was on it and it's a great episode. You should listen to it. She was talking about she just writes a little money crowdfunding, but she's like, I don't have a five year plan. I have three different ways I might want to exit like they raise money, so they're gonna have to exit. But she's like, I don't know what's going to happen. The media landscape is gonna look so different in five years. And I do think that's something I'm a person person. I enjoy knowing what's going to happen. I like want to know and you just can't. And I think the important thing and what you're good at and why this is so successful is like live. I hate this is really cliche, but like living in the moment or working in the moment and just doing the work in the moment and like not like thinking I'm going to sell this to someone and make 10 million on it. And then I'm going to run their public their magazine because by then people will actually be reading print again, which by the way, love that all this print is working. It's never happening guys. So just just keep your expectations. I love that all these print things are launching and people are making money, but it's never going to be a big thing again. So yeah, I think that your attitude about this is yeah, I mean, I have so many years of anxiety of when am I getting laid off to come to this point? It's not like I just naturally am like this. I am I am a rigid planner of a person, but I spent it's a it's been a very surreal career in that every time I had a job, the job I would look to doesn't exist anymore. And as I left the job, the job wasn't the wasn't filled. So it's sort of like the whole industry has sort of crumbled around me as I've continued to work because I love to work. And so now at this point, I'm like, I love the work. What can I just do to keep working? Yes. And that sort of subsec is me doing the same thing I've always done or the newsletters what I've always done on a new platform. And you actually said to me once like there will always good content is good content. And there will always be a place for that. And I I actually think about that a lot lately because I just right now I'm really enjoying the work and I'm trying to stay in that. Yeah, that I think it's a very specific person and you and I have very different personalities, but we do have share that in common that like there is a specific kind of person coming up in this fashion media in particular. Most people will be like, I can't find a job there. No jobs, blah, blah, blah. You can't think like that. You just have to you just have to work and like puck didn't exist three years ago. I really thought that I was going to be a BoF and leave and go freelance because I was itching to leave by like the last year I was like, I think it's time I've been here for basically 10 years. And I decided I'm going to figure it out. I'm going to save up money just like when I quit lucky, saved up money for six months and quit because I was like this job is I need to get this is not the right job for me. Yeah, we're very different in that. Yeah, I saved up money and I was like, got to get out of here. And the same thing with BoF. I was like, I'm going to stay for another year or so. I really want to see it through as much as I can. But like, I think it's ready time for me to leave. And then the puck thing happened. And yes, I've been very lucky. You've been very lucky. But also it's about like, you can't have a preconceived notion about what the job itself is. Like people are like, there's no job short. There's no fashion news director jobs left. Like Brooke, Bob, Brooke Bob, who has the last one. But like, there are a lot of other ways to do that kind of work. You just can't you can't be like stuck in this idea of what it is. And that, I think is a very particular kind of person. And those are the people who have long careers, where they're just sort of like, I can do the night Linda Wells, similar thing, like she was just on the same podcast, which is podcast is great. I love it. It's really good. It's just terrible name. She was on this podcast and she talked about when she got fired from a lure and she basically was like, they it was time for them to fire me. I'd been there for too long. And it was time for them to move on. Also, I mean, the business was falling apart or whatever. But also she didn't want to leave because she loved it. But then she like became a creative director at Revlon. That didn't really work. But now she's doing airmail. That's she's doing a great job. And she said on there, she's like, I would love to do a brand again. But she's not like stuck on my job as an editor in chief. And that's all I can do. And when you look at all the editors and chiefs who have been fired or left over the last decade, she's probably the most successful one. Maybe Joanna Cole's like, now she's doing this daily beast thing or like, who successful is not the right word relevance is the right word. And maintaining relevance is possible. If you like, get out of this box of this idea of like, you have to be a certain title or thing. And that's what I think you you excel in and means that whatever you do, you might do this newsletter for the next 15 years, you might do something else and you'll be really great at it and it will be successful. Thank you. I hope so. Becky, this was so fun. Is there any shopping that you've been doing lately that you want to end with? Any shopping I've been doing like, well, I'm just putting the finishing touches on Sunday's newsletter, which by the time this comes out, it will have already been out, but I'm very into drawstring pants right now. And I, I'm wearing a pair of cotton drawstring pants from the row right now, which I guess is really goes back to the whole idea that like you can be a real person and also still love fashion. Yeah. Because they're so ridiculous, but I love them so much. So that's probably my most recent purchase. I just recent my recent purchase. I just did an interview with the spread. Rachel Baker and Maggie Bullock's newsletter, and they were like, what's the last thing you bought? And I was like, the row, the row, the row. Shoot. Shoot. Do I have anything else to say? I'm returning that t-shirt from the row, though. It wasn't right. You're returning the t-shirt. Yeah. But I did buy a pair of those Charlotte pumps. Oh, yeah. But didn't you do that a long time ago? No, I have the lower almond ones, but I wanted like, I have the really high pump that they did in suede with the square toe. And then I have the low almond shaped pump. And this one is like a middle to wear with that skirt that I'm going to get the buttons moved because it's a little too tight. Yeah. I tailor everything. That's the other thing. Everybody just, you can tailor it. Yeah. Doesn't matter what it is, just make it perfect. That's the big lesson. Becky, this was so fun. You should come on on the Monday show one day to talk fashion news, though. It'll be really fun. Okay, sure. I'm very opinionated. Yeah. I think Jacob Gallagher, your old colleague, every time it's not him, he has a lot to text me about what the people say. Oh, I am sure he does. It would be fun to have the two of you on together, but I don't know if I get too crazy. Maybe we'll do it like a fun summer special. Yeah. Oh, I got to call him. Now we have the thing where since I left, we have lunch like once a year. Oh, fun. So I got to call him. Also, I'll see you in New York next week, probably before this episode. You're coming back? Yeah. I thought you said you're going to be in LA for the foreseeable future. Yeah, for two weeks. Two weeks. I'm just coming for two days. Okay. But I'm going to text because maybe I can get in on lunch with you guys if you're up for it. Maybe the Friday this newsletter runs, but I'll text you and let you know. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you so much for having me. Thanks for doing this and congratulations on all your success. It is well deserved. And I'm not just saying that because you're my friend. Well, thank you very much. We'll talk soon. Okay, bye. Fashion People is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck News, hosted by Lauren Sherman. That's me.
