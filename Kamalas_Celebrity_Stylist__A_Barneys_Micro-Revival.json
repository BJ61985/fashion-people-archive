And today with me on the show is the Wall Street Journal's Jacob Gallagher. We're talking DNC fashion. We're talking Kamala fashion. We're talking a Barney's revival and so much more. Let's get started. Hi everyone. Hope you are having a great week. I am in Los Angeles, back in Los Angeles until Labor Day. I'm just chilling out, seeing friends, going to the pool. Then it's off to New York for a 10 day run. I'm looking forward to it other than you know being away from my family for 10 days. It's going to be great. The shows start on Wednesday with Proenza Schooler, then end for me on Tuesday with Loire. I am not going to make it to anything that's happening the next Wednesday. It's interesting. A lot of the big shows, Proenza, Ralph Lauren, are showing really like front loading fashion week. Fashion week I don't think officially starts until Friday. What is it? Friday. I get there the third. Friday the sixth. Yeah, Friday the sixth. But there are a good amount of things happening on the fourth and fifth and all the way up through until the 11th. So yeah, I'm going to be going to a lot of stuff at the top and then tapering off because we have some internal puck stuff going on. I won't make it to everything. But I'm excited to be there. I think it's going to be an interesting week. This week on Line Sheet, things are starting to heat up news-wise. I have a little bit about the Saks vendor situation. I shed a little light on that. So for all of you asking me to write about that, it's in there. Also talked about Kamala Harris' current stylist Leslie Fremar and why they're good for each other, why it makes sense and why people haven't really been talking about it that much. They sort of come out the last week, even though they've been working together for a while. Look out for a lot more news though, fashion news as the week goes on. My inbox is filling up with tips and press releases and voice memos and all that stuff. So I feel like we're off to the races. It always starts earlier than you think. And as always send tips and comments my way via any channel you'd like, although just so you know, I always forget to check signals. So if you're going to message me on signal, be like, I'm messaging you on signal and I'll look it up. Okay, hope that helps. Anyway, let's get started with Jacob. This was really fun. We're both reeling from a week away from home. So it's a little goofy, but I hope you enjoy it. Jacob Gallagher, welcome back to Fashion People. I'm back. How was your weekend? It was nice. I returned from Chicago on Friday, this time getting out of the Midwest. I did not have any flight delays. So I was home in good time and had a nice quiet weekend of reading Oasis rumors and preparing for the U.S. Open like every other 30-year-old man or 30-something man in my life. But yeah, yeah. Don't de-age yourself, Jacob. I'm not going to de-age myself. I actually have a birthday coming up, but... It's exciting. Is it the big 30s birthday? I'm not quite there yet. I'm not quite there yet. Remember when you didn't want anyone to know how old you were? When I didn't want anyone to know. And I was, yeah. And now, though, at the DNC, I had the fun experience of being told repeatedly about many different events in life that, quote, unquote, that happened well before you were born. And I kept having to ask people, how old do you think I am? I don't think I look that young anymore, but yeah. I think that's a phrase people always say that. People always say this to me because of my little girl voice thing, which they don't realize is just like a way to get them to tell me stuff. Right. Right. Right. Right. We all have our tactics. Okay. Really quickly on the Oasis thing. Here are my two thoughts. One is, when you really think about it, it's only two songs. I will not allow you to slander my brothers like that. Liam and Noel bearing the hatchet is bigger news than any fashion news we could report this week. Now, this is incredible for the British economy. They will be responsible for an uptick in Stella and Guinness sales like the world has never seen in 2025. I think this is great for music. I think it's, again, great for the British economy. It's great for 30-something men. We needed a win and here we are. So Oasis is returning. It's also great for fashion. It is great for fashion. Because this is what I said in Line Sheet on Monday. I highly recommend that Burberry or Celine or someone do a press trip around this stuff. All the beauty brands are going to get boxes and all that. This is the best. You put everyone up at Shiltern Firehouse. Everybody goes. They sing the two songs that everyone knows. They post. It is the best press trip ever. I would not go, I don't take press trips and neither do you. I want all of our friends to take press trips and I want them to make a press trip around the Wembley Stadium. Forget about, no one wants to go to Glastonbury. Let's do the Wembley Stadium shows that are apparently happening. I think actually if any brand needs it, it's Umbro. Let Umbro re-release the kind of soccer tops and I think it would be big for them. Of course, Stone Island, a resurgence Stone Island has a lot of money to throw around. Apparently, maybe they should be sponsoring it. That's a great idea. It's good timing for Levi's. I saw Levi's has an Oasis collaboration that comes out this week. I like that we're talking about this on Monday and the news isn't even official. It's just that the internet has fully convinced us that this is actually happening. It is happening. They are being offered way too much money for it not to happen. The next thing will be that no one we know will be able to get tickets in any capacity and the resale market will be bigger than anything. We know enough rich people they're going to get tickets. I guess that's true. This is very true. The other thing is though, even if they break up, it's a great beforehand. They get too upset and can't do the shows and have to cancel. It's a great press trip. Robert Trifis, CEO of Stone Island, if you're listening, I know you are Robert. Call us. We have ideas for you. Okay. I'm excited about this. I hope that it happens we can keep revisiting the Gallagher Brothers' Mardings, which is the word I just heard this weekend. The one other thing I wanted to tell you is that I was in the Bay Area for the past week on vacation and on Saturday after spending a lovely day in Marin and going hiking with my three-year-old to a waterfall and taking him to a playground that is set in the Redwoods. It was incredible. I made them, my family, go to Evan Canary at five o'clock on Saturday into the city because Evan Canary is only open Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday. We're even Friday, Saturday, Sunday or something, which I guess you know what, I guess that makes sense if you own a retail store in San Francisco where there is literally no one, why would you have it open all week? But I went to the store and got the full Evan Canary experience. Was it everything GQ Magazine has advertised it to me? Honestly, the window display, which was like a hanger of a, it looked like it was like Noah Johnson's outline of his body, a lot of hanger. He does wear it well. You could have just put a cutout of his face on this hanger and I was like, whoa. That's incredible. It was very interesting. The guy who worked there who I believe, honestly, I can't remember. I think his name was Max. He was really sweet, but he was really nice to have fritz with some. We actually made friends with this guy, Stan, who was bought a shirt. Dan and I, my husband and I both tried a bunch of stuff on. So my takeaway is someone who is not as well-versed in menswear and also just like, I'm not a sponge. I don't have like an encyclopedic knowledge of runway shows and things. I know a lot of stuff, but that's not how I've prioritized my brain. It feels like it's obviously extremely Japanese influence, but the silhouette is so specific. I just think like my friend, actually our friend Adam Ray, who whatever, if he's going to get annoyed that I say something, but he said that like since he's moved to SF, 60% of his wardrobe has become that. And it makes total sense. Like SF is Margaret Howell and Evan Kenori. That's all you need to wear if you live there. You wear sweaters all year long. You wear muted colors. But I think it's a really interesting idea and it makes sense for that city and it has like a lot of ideas in it. I just think the silhouette is really specific and hard to wear outside of certain circumstances and I'm curious to know your thoughts. I own a few pieces. I think that it's, you kind of got to the idea that I've always had about the brand, which is, I think it's very well, I think the textiles, the, I would say the textiles in particular really feel right for a San Francisco climate. I've owned some stuff from Evan before where it felt a little too in between. I wasn't sure what season to wear it in. I had some pieces that were a wool linen blend and it was a little hot for summer, but then a little too light for winter. And I think that, again, that's aimed right at San Francisco. And that's also aimed actually probably at a lot of climates that are not New York and LA. So, I think that he's found an audience that likes kind of his fabric blends. And I like the silhouette. I think you're totally right. It does feel very, you know, when I went to Japan, Evan fits right in there and it's a very successful business. I really admire how well he has done from a very small outpost in San Francisco, which is not, you know, known as a fashion capital in any capacity. And yeah, I don't own or wear a lot of it, but whatever I see people, you know, particularly know of wearing it, it's the kind of thing where I'm always like, oh, that looks great. Like why wouldn't I dress like that? And I think NOAA does it well in the kind of completist way and it's a brand that looks good in that completist, you know, full look way. Yeah, it definitely makes a lot of sense for the UK as well, which like the UK and San Francisco have similar climate. So it and they're just a lot of, I wonder, I was going to say Boston, but that wouldn't work. I don't think so. Anyway, yeah, I mean, it's a billowy and it's like a curved silhouette. I just, I tried on pants and like they just, I also, for men, like it's not, and there are differences between, but my husband was like, this is just for skinny guys, which I don't agree with. It just isn't like he tried on the shirt that was billowy and then the sleeves were like slimmer or tapered at the bottom. He just didn't look right on him. He wears like he just, he wears office in general. He's like, we're straight. He's just to do like it just wasn't right. But I really liked it. And I think it actually is a similar thing. I love Margaret Howell, but I end up not keeping the pieces of Margaret Howell that I own. I think mostly it's a really straight silhouette in a way that like is just a little too severe for me. And I, I love it. I'm obsessed with it. Like every time I go to the store, I want to buy 55 million things, but I never end up wearing, I have one sweater from her that I wear a lot, but it's just it's a similar thing. But I was glad to see the store, which is really beautifully done is on a route. San Francisco is so weird and it's just gotten weirder since the pandemic. I was walking around on Thursday and I was like, there's literally nothing to do. I just, it's the strangest place in the world. Oakland and Marin and the like outside of the city are much more vibrant still. And so, but I really liked it. And I was glad to see his like whole vision. In person. And and congrats to Stan, who got that shirt. It was real sweet to Fritz. He shook his hand and everything. But it was great. But I was excited to share with you. One day I will get out there. Me, you know, I haven't been to San Francisco in many years. I don't think I will be there anytime soon. But hopefully one day, hopefully one day.

So moving on, you're you're a busy man. Let's get going. OK, tell me the big takeaways from the DNC. What did you learn? OK, so it's it's it's impossible to discuss the DNC without discussing the RNC. Like I'm not going to, you know, we're not going to get into politics. That's not there's other podcasts in the puck network for that. I I do think that. I think that the DNC is a good thing. I think that. There is some larger message from the the look of the RNC versus the DNC that does say something about the political parties right now, which is what I zeroed in on in probably a more eloquent way than I will hear in my article that I wrote last week about it. You know, the RNC is so homogenous in terms of it's all red. It's a lot of mega hats. It's like a very small box that that the of clothes that appear and of looks that appear at the RNC. You know, it's it's the cowboy hats. It's Trump's face on stuff. And it's like if you are there for five to ten minutes, you've probably seen everything you're going to see. I would say the DNC was extremely different and speaks very much to a party that is not united around a single figure that has been dominating the party now for a near on a decade. You know, at the DNC, I saw much more of issue based merch, if you will. There was a lot more stuff about abortion and about even and the environmentalism and there was some stuff about taxes and things that you just don't see kind of visual hints you don't see at the RNC. And I think also, you know, we are at the stage where the Democratic Party is kind of crawling like this campaign is really still very young, the Harris campaign. And you could really tell that the party had not yet caught up in terms of their merch output to what maybe people wanted. You know, the Democrats are a bit hamstrung on this front because they produce everything for it to be official campaign. It has to be made in America and I believe it has to be union made as well. And so it really is they're at a disadvantage compared to the Republicans where like most mega hats are just made in China and people are fine with that or they're made overseas and people are fine with that. The DNC's merch has to be union made and made in America. I believe that's true. I believe for it to be for it to be sold by the campaign. I do think that it's made in America. So so this is why actually like I went into the DNC thinking, OK, I'm going to see the Harris walls, camo hats everywhere. They were like spotting a unicorn because only 3,000 were made. I met a guy who had a real one and he was from Austin, which is where they were being produced and sold. And he or they it's where they were at least being fulfilled. I think that there was a company in Jersey that was also making them a colleague wrote about them. There's actually a great story on the journal about this hat company in New Jersey that's been producing these camo hats. But he like went to where they fulfill these hats and bought it in person. And that was the only way that he could really get it in time for the DNC. They they are I think they will catch up to it. But like for the time being the merch they had, but they still had Joe Biden shirts. They still had shirts that didn't have anything to do with Kamala. Like they for there's a lot of excitement. It's it's very clear when you're there, people are amped up about this candidacy. But they definitely do not have the merch yet to make as strong of an impact. There is no mega hat equivalent yet and the DNC and there probably never will be. That's not how Democrats are and that's not how they want to wear their views. But it made it very striking that oftentimes I'd look around and I'd be like. These people could be dressed for a convention on anything else, aside from politics. They were just in polo shirts and jeans and button ups and a couple tuckered, tuckered, tuckered, whatever those dresses are, like their tuckered, not dresses. There were a few of the a couple of those couple, a couple, a couple of these eyelet dresses would seem to be a big thing amongst young women in politics. But, you know, mostly it's just kind of quote unquote normal clothes, which I think does speak to the fact that maybe the Democrats are not as, you know, of a subculture in and of itself built around the candidate. Yeah. So two questions. One is I had some feedback from a line sheet reader when I said, maybe we'll see more isi-miyaki that there will not be any isi-miyaki. There was. DNC. There was. See, I knew it. And there are a couple of things. A couple of things. You saw some of the RNC. And at the RNC, and I think I saw two people at the DNC. Two people. Much more designer clothes, though, I will say there was much more visible designer clothes. Interesting. Part of that was that they invited kind of young, they invited 200 influencer types, they invited like creators. And then there were definitely other people that were like influencer types that also were credentialed. Like I saw that. What's his name? He's like the YouTuber, the progressive YouTuber. Oh, Hassan Piker was there. And he was in like, he likes designer clothes. He was in something that looked like Balenciaga-ish. But like, you know, I think it surfaced a little, but not, not a lot. But, you know, most people are just in your standard Washington dress shoe sneaker polo shirts. OK. So the second question is, I got a tip from someone whose mom is like whatever, what are they called? A delegate. A delegate? OK, a delegate. There we go. A delegate. Sorry, I literally, I don't have any more words in my head. I have no memory. I am 42 years old. I have a three year old child. I can't remember any words, only when I'm writing, but I can't, when I'm speaking, I can't remember any. The point being that their mom is delegate, sent me one of the state's dress codes. And it was like Tuesday, where white? Wednesday. Navy and white for guys, white for women. But on Wednesday, it was on Wednesdays we were pink, which is a joke about that movie that I did. Mean Girls. Mean Girls. Mean Girls. And, you know, blah, blah, blah. Did you see a lot of pink on Wednesday? Were there a lot of these like theme delegate dressing? Yeah, I mean, that is a thing that is existing at both the RNC and DNC. And as far as I understand that is that has been kind of a way that's been for a long time now that the respective state parties have dictated that. I think people stuck to it. I will say people seem to stick to it more at the RNC. And there was also more of like, like the Alabama delegation had, well, I guess, you know, but this is again, this is where there's crossovers that are the same for both parties. Like the Alabama delegation had baseball jerseys at the RNC and the Kansas delegation had football jerseys at the DNC. Like, they're, you know, they're all taking similar cues, I think. I definitely think that on the last day on Thursday, there was a lot of white. There was a lot of suffragette white and there was talk leading up to Kamala Harris' speech of she would be wearing white. She was not. But there does seem to be some of that, but there also seems to be people that people that you just can't tame, you know, like, and then there's small pockets like the Washington delegation wore cowboy Kamala sashes and like light up cowboy hats. But like there was 10 of them doing that and they were all the young people and they were, and I interviewed one of them and he was kind of like, we're doing it because people think I'm paraphrasing, but people think Washington is kind of boring and we wanted to show that we can have fun, which I thought was kind of a cheeky and funny answer. And of course, people were speculating all week if Beyonce was going to be there. She did not show up, of course. Yeah, there's some of that. But again, the dominant thing is like everyone just kind of looks like a business casual look for the most part. I'd say that's probably 70% of people and 30% of people kind of go for it harder. That would be my guess. Yeah. So moving on to Kamala s business casual and her Khloe suits. What did you think of the navy suit? I thought she looked great. I thought that it was, I shouldn't say it looked great. I look good to my eyes. You know, I don't judge women's wear super well. I thought it was an effective look. I think had she worn white, it would have been a little, she's not really in her speech, you could tell she's not a candidate that's fully leaning into the notion of the historic nature of her potential presidency. She's not running the Hillary playbook in that way. So I was, I didn't think she would wear white. It looked, it looked nice. I was struck that it was designer and I think that, that to me, you know, both, she wore Khloe both nights, correct? Am I right? Or no, she wore. Yeah. Yeah. So she wore, she wore Khloe both nights and I think that that, you know, we all remember when, you know, Michelle Obama wore J crew and was proud of it because it presented that the Obamas were frugal and that they were, you know, or relatively frugal, let's say, and that she was not fully indulging in designer clothes that we knew that she was also wearing designer clothes. But, you know, I think her Kamala being comfortable wearing Khloe on both nights and that being expensive and just kind of that being what it is, I do think it's a sign that maybe that's not a talking point anymore. You know, no one has seemingly seized on that. I know the JD Vance campaign has tried really hard to make it a big deal that she was wearing. I think in, I think actually, and I renew her necklace in some like video she posted. He keeps sending out an email about that, about like, look at how expensive this necklace is. That message doesn't seem to be landing in a huge way. And so I think maybe there is more of a comfortability of wearing high designer and saying, listen, you know, she's married to a well-paying lawyer. She's, you know, herself. She's from California where, you know, people like designer clothes and, you know, I think, you know, perhaps it just, it's baked in. It's who she is. So. Yeah. So, one day line she column is about this, specifically about her working with this stylist called Leslie Fremar, who she has been working with for a while. She did work with Carla Welch at some point for how long I don't know. I'm guessing it was the last campaign, but she has been working with Leslie for a while and it's this was sort of like an open secret in that world. A few things. I also think she looks great and the clothes are really well tailored. I think that the point that you made about people not really caring that the stuff is expensive, I actually think Michelle Obama is the reason people don't really care because she sort of normalized you're right about J. Crew for sure. But remember J. Crew at the time was had a big famous designer. So it still had a sort of say elitism, but a little bit of like this is an important designer quote unquote or whatever. But she went on like Kimmel or something or some late show at that time and she was like and you could buy the whole outfit for $300 or something like that and that was a huge moment. Yeah. But the thing was you couldn't buy it because it was like old, they always were like J. Crew that was like five years old or something. Anyway, you're right. But also she wore to Coon. She wore Jason Woo. She wore these. Yes. Ekram, her first not really stylist I would call like dresser or whatever. And then Meredith Koop who now works who's worked for Michelle for 15 years worked for Ekram in the store. And Ekram's a big store. She owns a big store in Chicago and that's where Michelle used to shop and that's how she ended up helping her. She wore a lia to an event. So I think she normalized wearing designer clothes and being, but the thing about it and you mentioned this not wearing white is I just don't think this is about the clothes. And there have been like a lot of headlines being like we need to pay attention to what she's wearing. And I totally agree. But I think like by saying we need to pay attention to what she's wearing and not just talking about what she's wearing. It's like missing the point of what's happening, which is that like she is there are a million things. One is that she is a grown woman who has made it. I mean, she actually she was a, she was a public attorney. So she probably didn't make a lot of money, but you're right. Her husband was an entertainment lawyer. They have money. The thing is like the thing that people don't understand about most politicians is that they use these like weird private designers who are not famous and those clothes are expensive too. So she's working obviously Leslie from what I was told from people like around these both of them is that Leslie, she needed someone to help her get dressed and Leslie is helping her get dressed. And that's the Leslie is like half retired from styling. She had, she's like dropped not dropped, but like ended with a lot of her clients in the last year and a half. I wrote about this a year ago. She only really works with Charlize Theron and Jennifer Connolly cause she was like sort of disillusioned with the way everything was working in the fashion industry and styling and how hard that is. So she is doing this as like a civic duty of helping this person. I don't know who she has a relationship with at Chloe, but they were able to make suits that look really great on her that she looks comfortable in. She doesn't look like she's put on when Kate Young was on last week. We were talking about Hillary and the issue with Hillary was like everybody loved her fun suits, but she never looked comfortable. And Kate was like, I remember seeing a photo of her with a big Moo Moo at a wedding and like you, you feel like you need to dress a certain way. Whereas I think Kamala is dressing her way. And that is why it just feels so much less, less, um, it feels so much more natural. And which I think is if you think about the whole campaign and pre campaign, you were like, oh, she'll never win. And then suddenly she's the candidate and everybody's like, it's just all happening very naturally. And I think the clothes reflect that. And the thing about Irene New Earth, which I brought up in this column too, you know, she's of Hollywood. She grew up in Venice and Brentwood or whatever. And her parents weren't in the industry, but she's super connected to it. Her partner is Phil Lord, who's a big movie maker and very famous in that world. She knows all these people. Irene, and she does get a lot of red carpet credits, even though she doesn't pay like most jewelers do because she's friends with the stylist. She's friends with the actors. And I think like the fact that Kamala is wearing Irene all the time is, she's in that world. And also they're in the fashion world too. And not just like the typical Anna Wintour thing. Obviously everybody is rooting for a lot of people in fashion are rooting for her, even if they're secretly Republicans. But, but also her daughter, her stepdaughter, Ella Emloth is a model and has done and has a fashion brand and all this stuff. So like all this stuff that's happening around her, I think is actually very natural. And I'm glad she didn't wear white. I'm glad she just wore two suits that she would wear any day she wanted to get dressed up. Yeah, it's also, I think worth noting, like she, and I think this is a big part of what you're saying is she's been in the public eye for a really long time. And so I think had she switched up her style, it would have been more noticeable. And I understand. I've read those articles as well that have kind of been saying, pay attention to what she's wearing and it matters. And I do hear that, but I also think that maybe people just are not taking as much notice of it because her style has been pretty consistent. She I think she's had a solid, you know, core sense of style for a while. She has her, her core brands like you pointed to, to Rory's column, like, you know, several years ago, Rory wrote about her. Her style has not changed. You know, if she had a whole makeover, it would be very different, which is I kind of wanted to. And obviously this is my bias, but like the guy, the person who I was so interested in stylized coming out of the, the DNC was Tim Walls, who like has had an actual glow up. He's the person on the ticket whose style has clearly improved in the past couple of weeks, but they are, they are running a very smart playbook with how they positioned him where he's cut like when he's on stage, he's wearing like, like the suits look good. They're kind of, they're inoffensive. They're not doing a thing. You know, there were some politicians up there that were wearing suits that I thought were too tight and too contemporary. Tim Walls would not look good in that. He looked right. But then they're also very smartly using him. And again, it's a parallel to how they're using him in his, you know, profile on the ticket itself. You know, they're, you've got Obama name checking his, his flannels and you have kind of this idea of him as being this flannel guy behind the scenes. But then when he's in public, he looks presentable and he's risen to, I think, the standards of that office of looking vice presidential. And so he has kind of the room to have the glow up. If she really radically switched things up and wore something a la what like Michelle Obama wore the night before, I think that that would have been too aggressive and would have been too noteworthy. I think we're getting to the point where, you know, when I was entering this election cycle, I was talking with my editor back when it was Biden and Trump. And I was kind of saying, well, we're not really going to write a lot because these guys dress the same and they've been on the public scene for a really long time. And I don't know how much I can spin out from just their suits. And I think probably ultimately that's going to be true for Kamala too, where she's just going to keep wearing probably a similar thing in the public eye. It's going to look nice. It's going to look polished. And there's not going to be much fodder, I think, for people like us to say, oh, you know, she was at this rally and she really sent a message with this thing. I think that those articles might not really be that deep as the candidacy goes on. Yeah, all great points.

This Barney's pop-up happening in New York. It's backed by Hourglass, the makeup, but they've brought in Julie Gilhardt and Simon Dunin to do it, and it's going to be a bunch of young designers. I love Julie. I love Simon, but I know Julie very well. She's awesome. She's one of the few people in the industry who really does care about these young designers and what happens to them. She does. Absolutely. I will go not only as a reporter, but to support Julie because whatever she's involved in is done with love and with sincerity. Generally, it's a little bit of a weird... At first of all, we know that ABG owns the license for Authentic Brands Group. One of these license firms owns license for Barney's. Seems a little bit strange to connect it to Hourglass cosmetics, but I'm curious what you think. You could never go home again. I think that this is a fine thing that will have absolutely no actual impact. As much as we like to be nostalgic about Barney's, it went away for a reason. I think pulling off in-person brick-and-mortar retail at that scale now is just really challenging. I think we've seen the department stores that I think have been able to survive are those that have a lot of depth in what they offer. By that, I mean, yes, they have the high designer, but they also... You look at Nordstrom, for example, and it's doing a lot of business in just normal guy clothes and vints and theory and things that are palatable and fine. I think that it's really hard to be a high design, very choosy store these days, and that's what Barney's was. Will I go to this? Honestly, probably not. I'll be totally honest. Until you mentioned it to me in the lineup this morning, I did not think about it. It was not really on my radar. I think these pop-ups now, gosh, as New York just become one giant pop-up, everyone pops up. Every vacant storefront is available for retail and or pop-ups. It's like we're just a pop-up shop and culture where you have to try to get people to shop by having some kind of scarcity principle to it. Maybe that works and maybe that doesn't. I don't think that it's going to be any indication that Barney's could make a go of it again. I can't see that. No. I haven't talked to Julie about it, but my guess is that her reasoning and Simon's reasoning to do this is to help these designers get them some exposure. All this stuff is just so goofy. The idea of I wish what I would love is for Julie and Simon to do something new, give them money to do something else. This is what, and so maybe that's what will come out of this, that someone will be like, oh, why don't we give them and bring one other person in and let's do something totally new. Maybe that's what will come out of it. I think the thing that's interesting, the takeaway for me is ABG has really tried to position itself as a new type of licensing firm. There are a lot of them that have popped up in recent years. The reality is a licensing firm is a licensing firm. The main priority is to get juice, these brands equity for what they can. Any other narrative is, yeah, the intention might be good, but it's only half-true. Let's see. I'm sure you and I will both go check it out during fashion week. Speaking of fashion week, I guess I'm going to see you. A lot of men's shows are happening. There are a couple men's shows. A few. I think, well, we don't know if off-white will be men's or women's, or at least I don't think as of taping. Todd Sider is showing. Let me think who else. Tommy Hilfiger. I feel like that day, you'll go to all three of those shows, right? I will try to go to all three. I don't know. I'm RSVPing Jacob for all three of those shows. I think I did RSVP. I don't say this as any, I think New York Fashion Week is fine. I don't plan on writing much out of it. Maybe I'll write a thing or two, but who knows what really- Jacob goes, people. He doesn't mean he's guaranteeing coverage, okay? Yeah. I mean, you know how it is. These stories, these brands, there's not much story to a lot of them. It's just kind of the show and it happens. I think that that's fine. But New York Fashion Week is not, I mean, we do not need to dwell upon how little moving of the needle occurs during New York Fashion Week. No, yeah. I mean, I'm very excited for Eliab, but- Right, but that is not for me. That's not for you. Yeah. Nor is, I assume you're going to the big show. Are you going to the Hamptons for Ralph Lauren? Oh, I'm going to go, yeah. Oh, yeah. So that's the one, but that's not for men, so I will not be there, but yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I hope someone, is anyone else going on this, which I'm assuming is the Hampton Jitney thing. If you're going, let's do the same one. So yeah, I mean, I'm going to be working the whole time. I just keep thinking, like, where am I going to put my laptop? This happened the time, did you go to the one where they had the, in the garage? I did not go to the garage when I went to the Central Park one. That was probably the last big one I went to. Yeah. They had a show in a garage, in his like car garage, Upstate. And they had cars, which were amazing. Like they played music. They had like specific music in each car. But the thing was, you didn't get the same car going that you got leaving. So I did like take my laptop everywhere. This is my life is taking my laptop to fancy events. Anyway, final thing, any big predictions of the fall. We have like, there's a lot up in the air. My prediction is that Hyder Ackerman is going to Tom Ford. Yeah, I'm not in the prediction game. I think I've made too many, I have too many unpublished drafts in my Google docs of rumors that I've heard and I feel very burnt. I'm actually staring one down right now that I just forgot I had open. I think something will shake out. I think, obviously, I don't think that Givenchy can sit dormant for as long as it has. I think perhaps, you know, maybe there will be some Tom Ford news. I think who knows what's going to happen with the various caring brands and the kind of chatter that we keep hearing about the about, you know, potential moves over there. But for now, the sleepy time, I think is about to come to an end. I think we're going to reach the end of New York Fashion Week. And then there will be stuff that will happen, which will be good. I look forward to writing about some of that stuff. But I do not want to play the prediction game. If you know anything, contact me. Do not contact Lauren. No, no. You know, if it happens in line sheet, it's real. No, no, no. Contact me. We'll get it buttoned up. We'll get it. We'll get a proper story going. You send me your hints my way, but I will I'll be I'll be delicate. Jacob, Jacob has way too many things he needs to check to be able to run anything. Send it to me first. Correct. That's why they should come to me. We're we're buttoned up where we will make sure the news is 100 percent accurate. But yeah, we can't bribe these people. They'll they'll go to the right. It's just business. They'll go to the right person. It's just business. They know the truth. Jacob, this was so fun. But we should do you want to catch up during fashion month at some point? Sure. When some of this stuff happens and you can. Yeah, let's let's talk during fashion month. Well, we need we need to catch up about the the US Open at some point, which is where I'm heading after this. I'm I'm on my way to the Queens. You know, I'm having on next week. Oh, Berg. Oh, God. OK, yeah. So she'll she'll she'll that's great. She'll she'll have a lot to say about the US Open. There have already been some some pretty good looking outfits out there. And people bring people bring the best, I think, tennis kids of the year for the open. So. Enjoy yourself. This was so fun. As always, I'll talk to you next week. Fashion People is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck, hosted by Lauren Sherman. That's me. Our executive producers are John Kelly, co-founder of Puck and Ben Landy, executive editor at Puck, edited and mixed by Patrick Antonetti and mastered and produced by Bob Tabador. Special thanks to the team at Odyssey, including J.D. Crowley, Jenna Weiss Berman, Maddie Sprung, Kaiser, Josephina Francis, Hillary Schuff and Kurt Courtney. Each spring, twenty three Pulitzer prizes are rewarded for distinguished journalism, books, drama and music. It was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll, and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out it was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are and columnist who risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th.
