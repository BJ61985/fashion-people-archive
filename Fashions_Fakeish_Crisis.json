And today with me on the show is the king of luxury analysts, Bernstein's Lucca Sota. This is the best-earning season, so we're talking the future of LVMH, what people should and shouldn't be copying about Hermes, and what's really going to happen with Sabato and Gucci. Let's get started. Hey, everyone. Hope you are having a great week. By the time you listen to this, I'll be in Chicago for a few days of selling sexy promo. On Tuesday, I feel like Mark Marin, on Tuesday, October 22nd at 7PM, we'll be at Madison Street Books with Samantha Lim a shots. On Wednesday, October 23rd at 5.30PM, we'll be at Space 519, Space 519 for a cocktail. And on Wednesday morning, October 23rd at 9AM, if you're a Soho House member, we'll be part of their Fashion for Breakfast series, hosted by Travis Martin, who has set this all up for us in some TV segments too. I'm excited to be on WGN on Thursday. Hopefully it actually happens. Huge thank you to Travis. He's great. You should hire him. Appreciate all the stuff he's been doing for us because who else would do it? No one. So thank you, Travis. On Monday's Line Sheet, I have a bit of something for everyone. More details on the discontinuation of Pug. Another podcast a lot of you listen to. What the LVMH Employee Shareholder Program, they would call it a scheme in the UK, means for all of you who work there. And most importantly, a fun return to one of my favorite subjects, Yook's founder, Federico Marchetti. So the rumor is that Federico is trying to buy back Yooks from the Yooks Net-A-Porter Group, which is being sold to my Teresa. I think the likelihood of that happening is slim to none. But it's a fun thing to speculate about and indicates that Marchetti is far from retired. I emailed him and said, hey, you're trying to buy Yooks. Call me. He didn't respond. I also reached out to my Teresa. They had no comment. So who knows? It's probably just like they had a meeting and it turned into a rumor, that type of thing. But it's interesting to contemplate. He is only 55. So I think this is not the last time we've heard from Marchetti. So I have a Gucci HR update in the issue of carrying earnings preview and a readout from the Academy Museum Gala where I stopped by on Saturday night. It's really glamorous. I'm not used to seeing that many celebrities in person. My big takeaway was, I've been to obviously go to things all the time with tons of celebrities, but I don't go to a lot of red carpet stuff because I'm not a red carpet reporter. But what I would say is as much in the same way like Valentino was amazing in person, the images of the show were not great. And if you saw it in person, you'd understand that it was really, really good. And Luca actually talks about what he's hearing, the response about Valentino from the market later in the show. But I would just say so many of the dresses that looked really, really good in person looked bad in the images because lighting is lighting. You just can't tell the Heim sisters in their Louis Vuitton looked amazing. I actually thought pretty much everyone wearing Louis Vuitton looked really, really good. And I wonder, they should just sponsor this gallon next year. It was a huge night for them, but there were so many good people. You can read more online sheet. Let's go going with Luca. It was a really fun conversation. I even asked him about his own personal shopping habits. So make sure to stick around for that. It's good show. Luca Soko, welcome back to Fashion People. Thank you very much indeed, Lauren, for having me here. I'm always so happy to see you. So this was a busy last week for you. Very busy indeed with the start of the reporting season being quite eventful, let me just say. With a lot of investors wanting to discuss the sector as a consequence. Yeah. So in your original note about the LVMH earnings, I always wait with bated breath for them to arrive in my inbox. You said that they missed badly on expectations, but then following up, obviously, you had a much more nuanced take. Obviously, they were down a lot more in sales in the fashion and leather goods sector than they had originally said they would be. But what do you make of it and what do you think it says about their business in particular, that we can talk big picture? To be fair, they never said anything. So they were not a lot lower than they said they would be. They were lower than what we on the street and investors thought they would be. So I think consensus was that close to zero or 0.5 to be precise. And then they came in with minus 5%. But I think that there are a number of reasons for this. First, the market continues to be difficult and the Chinese were decelerating in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. But the overall impression we get is that in the third quarter, they decelerated even more. I wonder if there was also an element at play which was the professionals, the so-called Daigus buying in Japan and pausing on the back of the Japanese yen rebounding in the third quarter. They can deplete their inventory. The fact that sales to Chinese consumers went from plus 8 to minus 5% more or less, I'm saying relative to what LVMH had disclosed here in the core, seems a bit abrupt. Even in the context of relatively softer Chinese demand, especially when we take into account that the Chinese in the mainland were not declining a lot and all of the decline was concentrated in Japan, if I understood correctly. So maybe this is a bit of a magnified effect of what we could be seeing because down the road, I'd expect that the professionals either in Japan or elsewhere will have to come back. And depending on how exchange rates go, they will buy in Japan, they will buy in Taiwan, in Singapore or elsewhere, or in Hong Kong maybe even. That is the point I think worth of note. The abrupt nature of this decline was a little bit strange. And then of course we need to take into account that when we look at company specific issues, when we look at the momentum of brands like Dior, for example, it had been fading a little and so had momentum at we turn maybe a bit less. So which means that both brands have work to do when it comes to bringing more innovation to consumers. My impression was that in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, Alwe Maetje has done a lot bigger, bigger flagship stores, bigger fashion shows, the Pond NERF fashion show, the sponsoring of the Olympics, big things, but maybe not enough newer, not enough bolder. And as a consequence, we've seen them busy changing some of the creative directors at Givenchy, for example, at Celine and maybe it could be the shape of things to come in other brands as well. Yeah, so someone said that a lot of the executives internally and the executives who want to push things forward more than some of the more conservative executives feel like this was a sort of kick in the pants that when things are going really well, you don't really want to change things. Like you said, it's bigger, but maybe not better. Whereas this dip will kind of give them a little bit of permission to shake things up and weirdly take more risk because they are so diversified, they can afford to take some risks. And it does feel like to me in there, we've talked about this before, the risk of luxury becoming a commodity. And it does feel at a lot of the big brands in the LVMH portfolio and outside of the LVMH portfolio, everything started to look too standardized. And I was talking to an investor when I was in Paris who said, we have 20 years of bags. These closets are filled with 20 years of bags. You have to give them something new. How much do you think in terms of at these bigger brands? Like Louis Vuitton is a unique proposition because I don't know if the creative director really matters. It gives them marketing attention, but that's not really what they're buying into those creative director's visions. For say, they're buying luggage and wallets and things, but at Dior, it feels like they've been sort of coasting. Do you think we will see more big changes? And do you think that this is a time of opportunity for LVMH? I think indeed, our industry thrives on newness. You need to give people new reasons and new ideas and new products that you can wow them with and that are going to be powerful enough to attract consumers to the stores or the more so at a time when demand is more guarded and more cautious. So indeed, I expect that there's going to be bolder approaches and some more innovation. After all, it's human that in the immediacy of the post-COVID pandemic, as demand was coming as an avalanche on luxury goods companies that they thought for a while they didn't have to change much because coping with this, a huge amount of demand was already a lot. Now that this avalanche is gone, well, I guess you need to go back to the drawing board and you need to do stuff that consumers will notice. They will turn their head. They will want to check that out in the stores. So I do expect that if we see it from the outside, I think within the company, this is a very clear priority. And we already saw that this musical chair game with Celine, with Fendi, with Shiro Shih as already started. Yeah, yeah, for sure. It's very exciting for me and you. So fashion and leather goods makes up about half of LVMH's revenue at this point. I'm sure it used to be far more than that 15 years ago. Do you think that we're going to see them continue to diversify to a point? As we know, they're not thinking 10, 15, 20 years ahead. Do you think that in that time period, fashion and leather goods will sort of recede in terms of the portfolio and what is driving most of the revenue? If so, do you think they're going to invest more in hotels and media? And I don't know, media is a really good margin driver, but they do seem to be buying a lot of things. So how do you see their portfolio mix changing and do you see it changing? Paradoxically, I think LVMH has diversified today than it was 20 years ago. Really interesting. Because you know, once the spirits back then was a significantly more important contributor. Today, when you look at profits, at least, you see fashion and leather goods as the lion's share of that profit generation. Going forward, I definitely expect that fashion and leather goods will stay very relevant. It is clear that LVMH has invested significantly in jewelry and jewelry brands are poised to become more important. Bulgari and Tiffany at the top of this more so than watches. I also think that LVMH has huge synergies between fashion leather goods brands. Think Dior or think Givenchy, the perfumes and cosmetics division and the selective retail division think Sephora. So that you can continue to drive the development of beauty in your core brands through the fragrances and cosmetics business and the selective retail business. I expect that beauty is most likely going to be an area of development going forward. And we saw the whole sector. If we look at what Hermès has been doing, if we look at what Kering has been doing, we saw the whole sector being focused on beauty as a way to attract the wider audience because beauty prices in absolute terms are quite accessible. What do you think about the fact that something like Givenchy, the fashion business and the beauty business run entirely separately? The former CEO of Givenchy had worked at L'Oreal for a long time and yet he was not touching that Givenchy beauty business at all. Do you think that because of the way LVMH works and it's so siloed business to business, even that has even been the case for beauty and fashion under the same brand name, do you think that we'll see more connectivity in this next phase of the group between those two parts of the business? Well, I think the advantage is that LVMH has a critical mass in beauty. Beauty has logic of its own with distribution, private innovation, competition that is very special to the sector. We saw in the past companies attempting to bring beauty closer to fashion and leather goods, think Barbary, when they bought back the license that they had within Tapa Femme and that didn't end up well. I believe that one of the advantages here, in fact, is that you have very solid businesses and you can operate those within the group. As you would be operating them if you had a big licensee, but in fact the licensee is within the group, the fragrances and cosmetics businesses within the group and that is what drives the beauty business forward in conjunction, I think, with a partnership with selective retail with Sephora, I think is a major platform to enhance the market share and the visibility of the LVMH beauty businesses. Yeah, it's interesting that none of the beauty businesses that are other than Dior, that are really dominant in the beauty conversation right now, though, are ones that LVMH owns. I know market share and mind share are different things, but Fenty Beauty was top of mind for a long time. I'm sure it still performs well, but beauty is so cyclical and so there's so many new brands every single moment. LVMH, they actually haven't made a lot of acquisitions in that space recently. Could you see them? I write a lot about what they're trying to sell in fashion or trying to buy in fashion, but do you think that they'll become more acquisitive or start to shed some of the underperforming brands that they own in the beauty sector as well? I think that there's a logic to be beefing up this division, especially if you want to move into skincare. You need R&D, you need patents and you could potentially find some of those in the companies that you can take out from the market and plug into your own business and make them enjoy the big brands that you have and the retail network that you have. They don't necessarily need to be big companies. They can be companies that can provide specific plug-and-play kind of know-how and products that you can then exploit at a broader level within your business. In fact, the fact that LVMH hasn't produced M&A in beauty is a testament to the fact that they have chosen to develop the beauty business organically and quite successfully. So I should say, rather than go out and pay top dollars to buy Goodwill. Yeah, it's interesting. I do wonder the Kendo thing seems to their incubators seem to have fizzled out and brands like Makeup Forever and other brands that they own aren't hitting the way they once did. They still have benefit. They have some brands and obviously you're right, the distribution platform of Sephora is the golden ticket in beauty. So it's fascinating. In jewelry really quickly, the absorption of Tiffany, I would say probably if you zoom out, it's been pretty successful. But there have been so many hiccups and I hear things. I heard that they had a really good August. I hear from jewelry suppliers in Italy that they are buying up space in those factories for four years ahead of time. They're essentially saying, we want you to only produce our goods for the next four years and we're going to buy you out for that period. So they're obviously investing heavily in it. I guess my question for you is, how do you think the Tiffany thing has gone? We know that the US is struggling and that's their biggest market. US and China are their biggest markets and they've both been struggling the last two years. And A, how do you think it's gone? And B, do you think that when you look at consumer behavior patterns that the high net worth consumer is going to be spending more on things like fine jewelry, which are more expensive per unit, but arguably a more valuable long term? I think all in all, the Tiffany integration has gone pretty well. I think that Delve made his work on many of the areas that we had thought would deserve attention, like for example, strengthening the shape collection, the lock series has been very successful. Silver has been leveraged and increased in price effectively. This is an entry price product that many brands would love to have and it is unique to Tiffany. In the high end, the Yellow Diamond collection, as well as focus of communication more on the high end, has enabled Tiffany to take what it should take, which is a higher position in the category, which is fully deserved, given the quality of the stones that they bring to the market. Maybe an area which is yet to be addressed is watches. Watches, I think, is still a bit of a nice sore when we look at the Tiffany store. And talking about the Tiffany store, I think a lot of work has been carried out to improve and upgrade the retail network in the US and increasingly in Europe, where I think is the new front for Tiffany. So all in all, I think that things are going according to plan and the strength, relative strength of the American consumers has definitely helped. And the cyclical recovery in US spend should also continue to help in 25, as we expect that the combined effect of the fat cutting rates and the November elections being or providing a bit more certainty about where things would be going are going to prove to provide a boost to the American economy and therefore to consumer feel good. Yeah, so I agree with you, but I also think people have the sentiment around Tiffany isn't great. Like it doesn't feel like, and maybe that doesn't matter, and it doesn't if you just look at the numbers. But when you think about, and I want to move on to one of their competitors in a minute, but when you think about like what the core, that core customer, the fashion consumer who is driving the conversation that the broader customer is like the thing that I hear a lot from people in the industry here is that Tiffany sort of alienated the silver customer that they should be doubling down on the sort of entry market that they owned and also making silver feel really refined and exciting to a fashion customer. And then all the gold and fine jewelry and all that stuff will follow because the kind of rich people who follow the insiders would be interested in it. But you're saying that you think that that's kind of BS and that they are successfully reaching the broader market, which is what is important right now. Yes, I think that Tiffany, even before the acquisition was quite visible in the entry price. In fact, a lot of the previous advertising was focused on entry price and silver for that matter. So I didn't feel that there was a need to stress that calling card, which remains very powerful for the brand, maybe there was a need which also dovetails very well with what Elvia Mage can do best to upgrade the brand and upgrade the business a bit. And it seems to be moving in that direction. Clearly moving up takes more time and more effort than coming down, which I thought was very much what Bulgari was doing. So it's going to take maybe a little bit more. But I think that the direction of travel is correct. Okay, I believe you. I just think I personally think that luxury is not necessarily or a good brand or consumer excitement around a brand is not necessarily connected to price at this point and that the teenagers who used to buy the Tiffany lockets are not as into it as they once were. And then also the industry insiders are buying Cartier or they're buying independent jewelers. And so that may not matter. And you're probably right. But it just feels like to me, they're missing out on something in that other price point that can still have great high margins. And you can layer on the sort of million dollar purchases onto that. But what do I know? You know, you know more than I do. No, no, no, possibly so. One also has to add to provide the full picture that as much as Tiffany has improved Cartier and Franckliff and Appell's reign supreme in the category. So let's make no mistake. We're still looking at runner ups that they up for sure not reach the top of the category neither with Tiffany nor with Bulgaria, I should say. Well, perhaps and we can move on to our friends at Richmont, perhaps it will be the way that Dior is always chasing Chanel. Perhaps it's in terms of brand halo or what have you that Tiffany will always be chasing Cartier and that's okay. And it still has a tremendous amount of value and prestige and all of that on the matter of Richmont and Cartier and Van Cleef. And I wanted to ask you about Richmont's fashion brands really quickly and their earnings are not until November. So this is far ahead. But I am so impressed by what has happened at Alaya, which has, I think, tripled or quadrupled sales in the past couple of years. Of course, they were very, very small, but they're into the hundreds of millions now. And then at Chloe, it's still very early, but it seems like with the new designer, new CEO, they have tremendous momentum. I have friends who are buying those bags, buying those shoes. And two years ago, I had sort of said those brands are dead in the water, essentially, they can't compete against the big labels. It retail in the stores online, they don't have as much marketing power, they don't have as much distribution power. And yet those are the brands people seem to be excited about on the list index and things like that. I'm curious what you think about this. And it's funny because I don't know forever, so many people wanted Richmont to sell those brands and they're still so small. But why do you think they are seeing a turnaround right now? I think that they've probably been on the front foot while the mega brands were busy counting the billions of euros of sales that they were achieving. If we look at MuMu, it's a similar pattern with a small brand also, very much sought after and were received by consumers. These brands have worked on product, they've worked on innovation and they're being rewarded at a time when maybe the mega brands have taken the eye off the ball, maybe they've also gone a little bit overboard when it comes to price increases and as a consequence, they've been leaving space to competitors in a way. And smaller competitors have been faster on their feet and they've been finding the right formula. We are looking at the top of the pyramid because clearly behind Alaya, behind Chloe and behind MuMu, there's plenty of small brands that continue to struggle. I will not mention names, but it's quite clear that there's a few of those. But even outside of Richmont, I think that you can find a few. So the success rate is not huge when you're operating a small brand, but when you do the right things, it is refreshing to see that especially the avant-garde consumers are very quick to reward you because they pay attention to what you bring to the market because they like the new content, because they like the new products. It's very exciting. It's a nice growth story. This show is brought to you by Boca. Boca knows that when you take care of your mouth, your whole body benefits.

Make the switch to Boca for the whole family at boca.com. Moving on to two more companies that are going to be doing their earnings this week, I believe. Let's start with, is Hermes, is Thursday right? Thursday? Correct. Yeah. So what do you expect really quickly out of Hermes, the brand that can do no wrong? The company that can do no wrong. I think that consensus is definitely in a very different place than what we've seen with LVMH in fashion under the goods, which was minus five. Here, we find consensus at plus 10, plus 11, if I look at the Bloomberg numbers. I believe that Hermes is likely to be at that level, if not better. Remember that they have quite a significant amount of pricing power that they've kept in their back pocket as they hadn't increased prices in the early time out of the pandemic, contrary, for example, to what Chanel had been doing. So this year, a pricing alone should provide around 8.5% boost to growth, which is very handy to have at a time when consumer demand is quite subdued globally and at a time when we are suffering a cyclical slowdown globally. So that is good. Hermes, to some extent, like Ferrari, has long waiting lists for its most iconic products. That should also help flowing through this soft patch, because if you were waiting for a Birkin or a Kelly bag and they call you up, no matter the macroeconomic conditions, you are likely to go to the store and pay up to get it. So this is a great way for Hermes to sort of smooth out their growth rates. And I expect that they should be ending the year on a very solid footing. One thing that's interesting about all these companies is they all try to copy each other. And what I think a lot of them don't realize is so many of them tried to get their prices as close to Hermes as possible, because they thought, oh, people are willing to pay for that. We can convince them that our stuff is worth that as well. But Hermes has been so judicious about the way that they've done pricing that it's just interesting. I was having a conversation this past weekend about the industry is not full of leaders. It's full of followers. And if something works for one brand, they try to apply it to their brand. And what the reality is, all these companies are so different, and you have to operate them very specifically. So Hermes is such a great example of kind of doing what's right for the business and not worrying so much about what competitors are doing. And it's easy to think that they've always been in that position, but it's not true, right? Like 10, 15 years ago, it wasn't so clear that they were going to be this dominant. I think you hit the nail on the head because one of the ills of our industry is that people, in some cases, are trying to implement in their own company strategies that have worked elsewhere. It's tempting to do so, but it's also wrong because what works in a company may not work in another because the nature of the brand is different. So I think we've seen this most recently when we look at Gucci trying to move to the mainstream and becoming classic and becoming quiet. But if the nature of Gucci is that it attracts consumers when it's spiky, when it's over the top, when it's so different and distinct from the rest of the crowd, then moving into the crowd and trying to camouflage as any of the other brands is possibly falling short of what consumers desire or at least this seems to be what is coming from the numbers that we see. So I think Hermès was very right in sticking to what has worked for itself and rather than trying to mimic and getting worried about street wear or getting worried about Chanel increasing prices a lot and so we need to increase prices too. They were very good at that, I think, maintaining their course and going straight and this has helped them to do the right thing. Speaking of Gucci, Luca, Caring is going to have their earnings on Tuesday, the day that this is published. Many of you will probably listen to it after Caring's earnings come out some before. But it's interesting, there have been so many, I had a piece in Line Sheet on Monday about all the movement, another executive of the company's chief brand officer, Alessio Benetti, left last week or was announced that he left and I listed out the chiefs, maybe not chief merchandising officer, but chief marketing officer, chief brand officer, head of image, head of customer relations, CEO of Gucci Americas. So they've had tons of turnover in the last year. Understandable, the CEO left a new CEO, two new CEOs were brought in. Now Stefano Cantino is being promoted to lead the business. He's going to want his own people in there. The interesting thing out of all of it and seeing that Alessio was leaving the chief brand officer, my first question was, does this mean that Sabato DiSardo, the designer, is leaving? And the conclusion after talking to people who work there and also the way that they've communicated on the top line, the company sent a press release today about their 2026 cruise show, which will happen in May 2025. And the sentence says Sabato DiSardo is hosting his cruise show in Florence. And so that means nothing. Obviously a lot could happen between then and now, but in my experience, if a designer is on their way out, the company starts to slow down how they communicate about them. For instance, when Caring bought Valentino or bought the steak in Valentino, Pier Apollo was mentioned in the release, but very, very minimally. Whereas in this press release, Sabato is the lead of the press release saying that six months from now, he's going to host his show. I'm curious what you think. I have heard and I guess we'll see a bit of the numbers. I don't know how much they'll really tell us tomorrow, but or Tuesday today, we're recording this a day earlier. But what do you, I'm starting to hear people, I'm seeing friends of mine who are big fashion shoppers buying the hiking, the Gucci horse bit hiking boots, for instance. And I had a friend, Messagery, who's a big shopper. She buys a lot of Prada and Mew Mew and Alaya. She bought a dress from Gucci this weekend. Now these are very, these are small anecdotes of people that are deeply connected to the industry. But I do think it says something about the fact that like, there are people buying this stuff and it's quite expensive too. There was an $11,000 dress my friend was looking at and it was almost sold out. Of course they didn't make that many, but she couldn't get it in her size. So I'm curious like from your experience of how these big creative director appointments are handled, do you think that when Cantino is officially made the CEO in January, we'll see a creative change? Do you think that they are too deep in with Sabato at this point that they need to write it out for a few more years and see what happens? Like what are you hearing from buyers and retailers about how it's performing? Like what's the state of that situation in your world? My personal understanding for what it's worth is that a change of creative directors is not going to come anytime soon. My impression is that with the new CEO being appointed, there's going to be a focus on execution and improving execution. You said it yourself, there's been quite a significant churn in terms of key responsibilities within the business. This doesn't make teamwork easy and so with Stefano at the helm, I believe the focus is going to be on making Sabato and Gucci work. Whether this will eventually work or not is the point of debate. One of the difficulties for Gucci is that it has attracted a very diverse audience with consumers in China wanting one thing and resonating in the past what Alessandro Micheli had been bringing, then getting bored of it clearly so that not even Alessandro Micheli would be enough to get them back and consumers maybe in other parts of the world, especially in the US or in Europe, maybe older consumers wanting something which was less in your face, which was more of the tomford era, which was elegant, maybe with more of a sexiness attached to it. I wonder when you draw a sum and when you look at the overall impact so far, this has been very difficult because in total, in the most recent quarters, Gucci was still quite negative. I don't get the impression that we are about to see a significant positive surprise in the third quarter. We'll see when it comes, but I think it's going to be still very much working progress, still very much working progress. The company is saying that maybe this was to blend, maybe there's a need for a bit more excitement, a bit bolder style and aesthetics. To my understanding, what they mean by that is that Savata could potentially bring that. You don't necessarily have to imagine this means there's a new designer around the corner. Let's see what they do. Quite clearly, when Cantino takes over at the beginning of January, we'll have to take into account what has been achieved in the third and in the fourth quarter. At one point, if things continue not to work, push comes to shove and even Savata could be in question, but I don't see that the alternative is either you change Savata now or you change Savata in three years. That could be something in between. If things don't continue to work, for if things continue or for.

He got a lot of criticism in the early years for sort of not evolving it enough. And I remember Francesca Valentini, who's the deputy CEO of the entire group, using the line a lot, it's an evolution, not a revolution. But eventually, the brand did change quite a bit and he started to rely far more on sort of the vintage look, the San Laurent archives more literally than Eddie Slamann ever did. And it gave the business and now they are having their own challenges. But like for a few years, the Vecorello wave was really about like classic stuff at retail. The runway was like very inspired by old school, San Laurent felt very, very throwback. And it still is this last collection like felt like a walked into the archives. But that brought more excitement to the brand. And I think a big part of that was that the team under Vecorello changed quite a bit. Do you think that one thing that they could do to umph it up is bring the right team in? Now, that being said, I truly believe that in all of these circumstances, it doesn't matter. The creative director is the person. And even it's how they use the team under them that makes it good or not good. But do you think that potentially instead of removing Sabato and changing things all over again, that they may just keep tweaking the team around him to the point where he can be his best self? And also he's learning on the job. He's never done this job before. He's quite young. Do you think that like the behind the scenes people are just as important as the person in the center of it? I think so. And frankly, I believe in the partnership and collaboration of the creative director with the chief merchandising officer. I think that that was the key to the success of Gucci. Because we always talk about Alessandro Michele. But I think we should also talk a lot about Jacopo Venturini and his ability to make Alessandro Michele a success. His idea of structuring the Gucci collection in three layers, having the right price points, having the right elements in the collection and so on. So I wonder if that could potentially be an area for closer teamwork. I understand that Maria Cristina Lomanto has been focused primarily on elevating the brand. But I wonder if you need some kind of bridge between the creative director, the brand elevation effort, and the sort of plain vanilla merchandising approach so that you can sort of make sure that the collection is also very commercially viable in a way, both in terms of its content, the technical content, and in terms of its price architecture. Because otherwise, you risk increasing prices at a time when the brand is yet not particularly compelling. And that could potentially backfire as well. So I sympathize that you are talking about your friends buying $11,000 dresses at Gucci. But I don't know that this would be. We live in a rarefied world, Luca. Well, good for them. But you need a lot of those to sell 10 billion euros of merchandise. So that's my only concern. Really quickly, on the broader caring portfolio, what are you expecting to see? From my reporting, I understand it's really stable at Balenciaga. It's going pretty well. They're having, speaking of merchandising, really a lot of success with that new bag. It seems stable at Bottega. I assume they wish it was going a little more quickly. But it's been like there's a lot of good will and everybody's excited about that brand overall. What do you think about San Laurent and the portfolio overall? Do you think that they still are on the hunt to buy something else? I guess they will eventually absorb Valentino if everything goes to plan. Do you think about the Valentino collection with Jacopo and Alessandro back together? What do you think is going to happen, Luca? I think that Valentino has a lot of promise and indeed the feedback we're getting from the market is that Valentino is indeed attracting a lot of attention and producing quite significant traction. The collaboration between Alessandro Michele and Jacopo Vinturi seems to be working again, which is promising. As far as MNA is concerned, I think that Caring has done a lot already. CREED, Valentino, some of this has yet to complete or at least 70% of Valentino has yet to be bought by Caring. There's puts and calls in place. They will certainly do that according to the schedule they have agreed. I don't know that Caring is necessarily going to be particularly active in the next year or so because they need to digest some of the acquisitions they made. They need to make them work. For example, their ambitions in beauty have to be finding fulfillment and they need to also make sure that they have the core business back in shape so that from a balance sheet viewpoint, they have the right leverage and don't go overboard. As a consequence of overexpanding the perimeter at this stage, I think that they've done quite a bit already, including the investments that they've made in real estate, which have been quite important. Last question, Luca. How much are you shopping for research? Do you, I know you're going to do channel checks, but are you a consumer of these goods? I don't know that I am the typical luxury goods analyst sporting four or five brands at a time. I think I look a lot. I listen a lot, but I don't know that I'm necessarily buying a lot. I think that I am a bit more of a basic kind of guy. I love these products, but I couldn't describe myself as a fashionista and not a fashion victim either. I try to be disciplined with what I do and I have the perfect excuse because working in the sector and covering many companies, I cannot show favor for this brand or the other. At the end of the day, if I buy stuff, I buy stuff from relatively small brands that are not particularly well known or not particularly fashionable either. I feel that I have a license to do so. I have a similar approach except for Alaya. Luca, you know the one thing that everybody wants is some Luca-Solcombe merch. Maybe we can make that happen. All right. With your help, baby. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Thanks for taking the time. It was so fun and great to catch up. Good luck this week. Thank you. Take care.
