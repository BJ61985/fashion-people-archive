Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Puck's Fashion and Beauty Memo Line Sheet. And today with me on the show is the internet's favorite personal stylist, Allison Bornstein. We're talking the art and business of getting dressed. Before we get going, I wanted to remind you that if you like this podcast, you'll definitely love Puck where I send an email three times a week called Line Sheet.

Hope you're having a great week. It's been a busy one in Los Angeles on the back of the governor's awards. There were so many events and dinners and parties and launches. Seemingly all at the chateau, I was supposed to go to so much that I didn't end up going to for a million reasons, but I did hit up a sub-stack drinks thing at L&E Oyster Silver Lake. It was super nice. Great fries. Some of the top fries in Los Angeles, although that list is quite short. So take it for what you will. But it was fun and interesting. As of right now, I am also going to try to make it to the Nike Sakai launch downtown. But I don't know if I'm going to make it. I have a stacked schedule on Thursday night. And I'm just reminding myself that in Los Angeles, you really can only do two meetings a day. Sometimes I schedule four or five and it's just stupid. So we'll see. If I don't make it, I'm sure it'll be great. Love Nike, love Sakai, love the combo. I really just focused on reporting this week. Got on calls and met with people all week long in Line Sheet. My partner in Beauty reporting, Rachel Struegatz, has a huge scoop about an executive change estate lotter. You should read about it on Line Sheet, but Desi-M's CEO is leaving the business. And I don't know if anyone has followed this Desi-M saga, but it is... Rachel's always saying that there aren't as many interesting characters in Beauty as their arm fashion. I think she's proven herself wrong many, many times. But the Desi-M story of the last 10 years, their rise, what happened to the co-founder, it's a wild ride and documents it, particularly in this piece. So you should check it out. I was on the Kandina's beat this week. I can't quit Kandina's, or you won't let me. That's essentially the deal. But you should check it out. It's about their general global business issues, but also what's been happening in China. And really interesting thing that I think I knew already, but was reminded of this week, is that in China, GQ was the biggest brand and was a huge revenue driver for them. At one point, it was making $150 million a year in revenue. I don't think it's making that now, since they haven't been able to publish it for several months, but you can check that out. And I have incremental updates throughout the week on Kanday. I also dug into sort of the state of caring and doing a little comparing contrast of caring versus LVMH. And another thing on Thursday that was really fun was I got a hold of the Mark Jacobs edited issue of Vogue. And at the same time, I also got a hold of two very pristine copies of American Vogue from November 1999 and November 2000. So I went through those and then I went through this one and looked at both and what's better or what's worse. And what I would say, I mean, you should read this. I think it's really interesting. I think the magazine is better now. Like this issue was better than those two issues. Maybe not every single time, but this one in particular, it's you think that they were so perfect back then and they took a little more risk and it was a little looser. But this issue is really good. You should buy it. Like, I know you can read all the stuff online. I'd read most of the articles online already. Should buy the issue. It's really fabulous. And it just made me feel good. It was a nice, nice thing to have to do for work just to flip through these pages and analyze them. Yeah, that's basically it. I hope you enjoy this conversation with Allison. I am interested in people who make businesses out of things that other people wouldn't be able to make businesses out of. So she is, yes, a person who talks about trends and personal styling and is just sort of a character in the fashion world, but she is also a very compelling entrepreneur. So I really enjoyed speaking with her and I hope you enjoy this one. Allison Bornstein, welcome to Fashion People. Thank you for having me. So it's very early. We're both in California and it's 6.33 a.m. because we're both early risers and thought this would be the most efficient way to do this. So it's kind of two or I don't know, have you had breakfast yet? Do you eat immediately when you wake up? I have not had breakfast yet. I was waiting for this question. I've had, I'm having coffee, but breakfast I think we'll be after. What do you typically have for breakfast? I'm like a Greek yogurt kind of gal, like Greek yogurt with, yeah, just with different fruit. That's kind of my go-to. It's very good. Yeah. I went through a phase years ago where I would like eat immediately when I woke up. I actually did too. I used to wake up starving. There was like one point where I wake up so hungry and now it's like I kind of not, not I don't have to force myself, but it's like I kind of have to be like, okay, like let's do this before the day starts. Yeah, I wonder if it's something. Do you have a different schedule here than you have in New York in terms of like sleep and when you go to bed and like your whole the way your day works? Yeah. Yeah. I wake up way earlier here. I feel like everything here is just like a lot slower. So I don't know if that has anything to do with it. I don't wake up like ravenous and crazy. I wake up like a little bit more relaxed, I think. I don't know. What do you like living in? California? I do. I was just in New York for like 10 days and I've noticed that I've just noticed that generally that I don't eat as much here because I don't move around as much, but also that when I would wake up in the morning there during fashion week, like I don't even think about it because I'm eating meals so late at night that it would be crazy to have breakfast immediately. But I did notice last week, even though I was like going out for pretty heavy dinners, I was still really hungry in the morning, I think, because I was doing like 20,000 steps a day or whatever. Whereas here, I mean, I went to, I technically went to bed at 10 last night, but really like 830, I fell asleep on my couch. Wow. And then woke back up and like took my vitamins and all that stuff. But yeah, I like living here a lot. It feels like for me, it's a really good way to sort of ground myself. And I like, I don't know, I was, I've, for 10 years, I just spent as much time here as I could. I did have really no obligation or reason. And then yeah, I just fell in love with it. I just feel like it's the place that I'm meant to land when I land. That's such a good feeling. Yeah. Whereas in New York, I feel very, I love it and I'm really addicted to it. Like last week, I was like, I don't, we should live here. It's so much life makes so much more sense here for the way we are or personalities, like kind of people that I need to see and all that. But the reality is like, I'm so stressed out the whole time I'm there. That's no matter even if I'm living, when we were living there, I was just constantly like stressed and here I don't feel that way. How, how about you? We moved around the same time, I think. Yeah. It's been like almost two years for me here. Same with you. I'm four, but whatever. Pandemic doesn't count. Same as, yeah, it doesn't count. Yeah. I feel the same. Like being in New York, it feels so fun and exciting and every time I go, I'm like, Oh, I love it. But I feel like in New York, you can do like so many things in a day. You could do like, right? Like you could get 20 things done in a day. So like you're kind of forced to always be moving and here you can do like two things in a day and that's just kind of, it like has to be okay. And you have to prioritize what those things are. One of my colleagues just message and said, if should we do a dinner next week? Cause a bunch of puck people are going to be in town and my instinct is yes, because I want to do everything I can. But my other instinct is I already have two things that I committed to that night. I probably won't, I'll only go to one. Like it's, um, it is, it really makes you think about who do you want to see? Who do you want to spend time with? And you have to be so much more intentional with like every single thing that you do, which is kind of nice. Yes. Totally. It forces you to set some boundaries, which I don't have. So it's great. Same. I mean, as, as we are aware since it's six 30 AM and we were like, yes. Greg, let's do it. Molly, my producer, I know, is I'm like five 30. That's great. I could just get it out of the way. And then I, and then I can do all my other stuff. You're always packing it in. Um, yeah. So how did you get here? Tell me about, you are a sort of an online phenomenon, a phenomena, phenomenon. I don't know, but, um, you have had like an amazing ascendance in the last five years or so, but that said, like you've been working your butt off for years. And how did you get to California? And tell me a little bit about your career pre being this like wardrobe expert that everybody sort of goes to first when they're, when they need help. Okay. Thank you. I went to FIT for going to start that far back. I went to FIT. I interned at Teen Vogue and I'm from Michigan. So before interning, I had no experience. I didn't know anything about fashion. There wasn't like, obviously there wasn't social media, but there just wasn't like access to the industry back then. Like, you know, like I knew stuff from like reality TV and from reading magazines, but I really didn't understand like what the jobs were and like what the jobs even meant. So I interned at Teen Vogue and I went on set for a photo shoot and I saw the stylist and I was like, Oh my God, like how cool. Like somebody's picking up the clothes. That is so fun. And so just from there, I would, when I was in school, I would intern on the weekends, I would assist stylist. Like I would just do anything I could to be like around photo shoots and around all the clothing. It was just like such a pleasure for me, which is so embarrassing. Like I remember a stylist asked me to like pick something up from Mark Jacobs, like literally just like pick up a garment, garment bag. And I was like, Oh my God, OK, like what do I wear? And it's like, no, like you're basically a messenger. Like this isn't like that cool. But I was just so excited because I never been around these types of clothes and these types of people. And it was just, it was really exciting. So after I graduated, I assisted a stylist for like almost six years. And we traveled all the time and she did a lot of editorial. She did a lot of celebrity styling. And so I learned all of that. Was it, was it Julia Van Bohn? Yeah, it was. Okay. She's great. Yeah, she's great. And was that when she was doing in style as well? That was after my time, but we were doing a lot of the Harper's Bazaar covers. Oh, cool. Celebrity styling was kind of newer to me and she was working with some celebrities. So that was really cool. So I feel like I got to learn everything, which was really nice. And I am somebody who like really does like to learn and like to do a good job and kind of like perfect things. So I really, I enjoyed being her assistant a lot. But when I went out to do my own things, I was just sort of. I was trying to figure out like, what is it that you really love about this? Like, do you like being on set? Do you like working with the models and celebrities? And I think the answer was like, kind of no. I think what I really loved was I loved like sort of creating when we work with celebrities, sometimes she would let me help style for like the airport or like, you know, like those moments that are the in between moments. And I realized that's what I really loved, like creating looks for every day that felt functional and felt like they were like expressing who the person was. And even just kind of like, even just that little bit of like, it still has to look like it's this person's wardrobe, even if it's not like kind of those considerations too, I found really interesting. So that means like, you have to understand who the person is in order to dress them in a way that you think that they would dress themselves. So I found that part really fascinating. And then when I went out on my own, I just started doing personal styling. So going into people's wardrobes with the intention of helping them. Curate a wardrobe or understand their wardrobe and figure out like how to get dressed for every day, like what are the things that you need? What are the things that you don't need? And like really teaching my clients, like how to put looks together and like how to find their style so that hopefully they don't need me. When you first started doing that, like what were some of the big observations that you, that you called from like looking at people's wardrobes? Like, are there issues that are sort of universal in many people's closets of of what they don't have enough of or what they have too much of? And what were some of the things that you thought, oh, because you're very good at like pinpointing how to fix your wardrobe. What were some of the things immediately that you were like, okay, this is an issue that like a lot of people have in terms of their, their inventory? Yeah, well, I think it's too much inventory a lot of times. Like people are just sort of like gathering and collecting, but then not really knowing what to do with it once they have it. I think now, you know, like with social media, it's so easy to see something and to buy it. And so that's what we do. So we have a lot of things, but then it's like, again, like once the things are in our wardrobe, we're like, okay, well, wait, like what do I do with this? Like I got it. Like I did that part, like that's step one, but now like what do we do? So I felt like there was a lot of, there is too many clothes or there are too many clothes in people's wardrobes and they have a lot of things that they obviously like because they purchased them, but they're just not sure like what to do with it. Or even like to understand like, why did I buy this? Why do I like it? Like what was my intention? Like what was I trying to do by buying this? Like how, you know, what was that choice? Um, so I try to help people understand that. And I feel there was a moment, like right after the pandemic where I think people really pared down and we're like obsessed with like this idea of like elevated essentials and only basics. And so I think now post pandemic, like, you know, people are now wondering like how to get their personality back into their wardrobes, you know, like I feel like they edited so much or they, you know, kind of really bought into this idea of like quite luxury or like we just need the basics, we just need the essentials. And I've like, okay, well now I look like everyone else. And like, how do I put my, my spin back on, on these looks? Interesting. So you were living in New York at the time when you started your business. Yes. What kinds of people were reaching out to you? Was it like really high profile executives? What was like the profile of the person who wanted your services? Not high profile. Like really, I don't like normal, regular people. I kept my prices pretty low at the beginning just because I mean, because that's probably what I could charge, but also because I was like, I want to, I want to go in all different people's wardrobes. Like I want to really understand like everybody. I think also working for Julia and working, you know, for like a, a stylist that did a lot of high profile editorial things. I thought I was a good stylist. Like I thought I understood a lot of different people in a lot of different bodies, but like I didn't, you know, cause there's not that much variety there. So in, in starting my business, I was like, okay, I really want to like try to work with every kind of person. So there were a lot of girls in the, in the very beginning, a lot of girls that were like, wanted me to help them with like looks for a vacation, let's say. Like that kind of thing, um, you know, sort of special events, but then it ended up being like, we would broaden it a little bit to be like, okay, like, well, then how can we also wear this dress that we're buying for vacation in real life in the summer? Like that was the way that it started. How comfortable are people buying stuff? Like when you, so they're willing to just, if you say, get this whole thing, they just will be like, sure, I'm just going to buy it. Yeah. I think even like, you know, I work with people like all different, um, budgets, all, you know, around the world buying stuff is really easy, you know, like, and right, like it's, if, if somebody says like, buy this, it's going to change your life, it's going to make you stylish. Like this is the thing you need. Like, yeah, somebody will buy it, but I really try not to, like I give suggestions, like very thoughtful suggestions of what I think somebody should add to their wardrobe, but I'm very careful not to be like, okay, buy all of this because I want them to like understand more, like why are they buying it? You know, a lot of times, like in the beginning of a session, a client will say like, I need tops and I'm like, okay, like first of all, that's so broad. And so I really like, we kind of like take like the hour top to style things, but to like figure out what, what kind of topic, what is it that you're needing from a top, like how can we find the top or the tops that you need, not just top, you know? Yeah. But yeah, people are so, it's really easy to buy clothing. So I feel like that's almost the easy part. And then the styling it is the hard part, I think. It sounds like you, what you really should have gotten into green is psychology. Well, that's a huge part of it. Yeah, especially you, the way that you think about it and the sort of language you've put around building personal, your personal style or building your wardrobe. When did you start doing more public facing online social media? Like you've become very well known for your TikTok posts, which you do such a good job with, you're so straightforward and not annoying. But like, when did you start doing more like talking to the camera, but also just posting on social media and realizing that like part of your business was going to be doing that stuff too? I started that in the pandemic and that was really hard for me. I mean, obviously it's not that natural to talk to the camera, but yeah, I had a really hard time and a lot of the feedback. And you're not like, sorry to interrupt you, but no, you're not a self promoter. Just interesting because you're you're doing this very public thing, but you're not like, it's not about you and so many people who are really public. They the main reason they're doing this stuff is to promote themselves and yours is not like that. So it's interesting because your personality, if I met you at a party, I wouldn't think, oh, this person is like a TV personality. You don't have that like and not that that's bad, but like that thing. You don't seem like you are. You feel like you're the center of attention. So it's interesting that you, I guess because of the pandemic, did you feel like that sort of like propelled you to do that stuff? I did. And also the first thing I ever did on camera was a YouTube video with my friend, Vila, and I really didn't want to do it. But she was like, listen, like you're the teacher and I'm the main focus. So like that really helped me to sort of be like, OK, like if I'm doing my TikToks or my YouTube or my Instagram, like I'm sort of just like the teacher and using somebody else as an example. So like I'm not centered sort of in the narrative. It's like it's about this person and I'm just pointing different things out. So that made it a lot more comfortable to me. And then of course in the pandemic, when I didn't have like a, you know, example to do it with, I would do things on myself. But by then I was a little bit more comfortable. And again, like, you know, not like by everything that I'm wearing, just sort of like using myself as an example. I this is really lame, but I do think of myself as like, obviously a fashion person, but I think of myself as more of like a teacher. So I think that also makes it easier for me to put out the context. I'm like, look, I'm like sharing something. I'm teaching something. It's not really about me. Yeah, it's interesting that you mentioned Violette, who's an amazing makeup artist and has an awesome brand of, I have her. Beezoo, but I bought like millions of these. And then our mutual friend, Delphine, will be like, I can get you some. I'm like, I just bought it all on, on shop, on Instagram shops or whatever. But I think one thing that's that people forget about a lot of jobs connected to fashion and beauty and Violette is the same. A, there is a lot of instruction and B, these are service jobs. So like you are working for someone else and there is that element of they're glamorous and they often require for you to be public facing. But at the same time, there is sort of you're in the service of another person. So it does feel like I'd say a lot of your videos that you do. It does feel like you are in the service of your viewers or your followers or whatever. And, and it comes off in like a very clear way that I think is a big reason people responded to it. What was an early video that you did that you realized, oh, I'm really onto something. Well, one that I, that like actually got like, quote unquote, viral was when I was talking about like this, like how to find your style using like this three word method. What was so good about that or great for me about that video is I was reading off of my book proposal, just like kind of literally had the book proposal up and was just reading it like into my TikTok and that one went really viral. So I was like, okay, this is going to be like, this is going to be good for the book. I think the three word method one was probably like the most viral and that's when I was like, okay, like I can keep doing this. It gave me confidence to like keep pushing on when you're doing like videos, you know, and social media. It's like, sure, like you get likes, but it's so, it is kind of isolating and it feels like you, the feedback feels, I don't know, there's something about it that you really are not sure what you're doing and you're not sure if people are responding, but that one, it really felt like people like, you know, we're making their own videos about the method and all this. So I was like, oh, okay, like this is catching on. And so it felt like that was good feedback for me. Let's talk about the three word method, which will be in your, in your obituary. It's like the thing. How did you come up with it and explain the sort of strategy and the framing of it and then we can go from there? Cause we could talk about this for three hours, I think. Yeah. So the, the way I came up with it is, you know, I was doing these one on one virtual consultations with people. And what I realized is that the reason that people were buying a bunch of clothes and not knowing what to do with them is like, they really didn't have like a clear vision for their style. Like, you know, like if you're designing a house and you don't have like an inspiration or a vision board, it's like, you're just buying a bunch of shit and like hoping that it works nicely together, but like it might not. So I was, I was noticing that and I was just trying. Also a lot of people felt like they didn't have style. And, you know, they were buying clothes and making choices. And I'm like, no, no, that is your style. The choices you're making, like that's your style. That's your taste. So it's, to me, it was just like an easy way to help somebody understand their personal style and to help elevate it. So like the first word is the realistic word that you find by looking in your wardrobe. The second word is aspirational word that you find by looking at what you're inspired by. And then the third word is sort of the emotional word where you ask yourself, like, how do I want to feel in my clothing? And I found that like the recipe of those three words or those three categories could really kind of help frame things for people and give people some like necessary guidelines because fashion can feel like really confusing. And there's so much and there's so many trends that if you have like a mantra or just like something to kind of like keep going back to, it allows you to weed out a lot of the things and allows you to like really hone in on your style and what you like. Do you tend to give people like a list of ideas to get them moving? How do you get them to figure out what they are? In my book, I put like a whole like wheel in a list. But normally, like when I'm doing styling sessions, like it's kind of fun. Like we'll get on the call and a lot of times I have my words like I'll tell you right now. And so they'll tell me their three words at the beginning of the call. And by the end, we'll kind of like refine them or dig into them even deeper. So I really figure out like, OK, if you're saying classic, like what does that really mean to you? Like what is it about classic or like how would you describe classic? So then we get them like really specific and that's fun. So a lot of times people already kind of have an idea. Yeah. And sometimes it's really interesting because like some, you know, people will obviously use words like, you know, classic or chic or elevated. But then I have people that use like celebrities like I was listening to your episode today and you were saying that like Sophia Coppola was one. So like some people would say use Sophia Coppola as one of their words, you know, or like Manhattan as one of their words, which is really fun. So I try like not to give too many guidelines because I think like people can be really creative when described, especially like a non-fashion person to describe what they're liking. Like it'll be really interesting because it's like they're kind of pulling from like a different vocabulary. I was trying to look at my texts from when I came up with my three. And now I can't find them. Well, definitely. I think it was like either masculine or sporty for one of them, maybe the middle one and then elegance for the last one. But now I kind of think Sophia Coppola is a good one for me. Isn't that a good word? Like I feel like in every like 42 year old woman in the world. I mean, it's an amazing word for like a lot of times people, I think Delphine, our mutual has all as one of her words. Oh, yeah. I actually wanted to ask you about the Olsens and because I was looking through some of your videos. I mean, I love the role. I know there are people who just listen to this podcast because I talk about the role a lot, which is hilarious to me. Shout out, Madhika Padman, who apparently is obsessed with the role. And I think that's why she subscribes to Line Sheet and also listens to this occasionally. But I love the role and have a lot. I'd say in the last few years, it's been the thing that I've bought the most of from like, especially post Phoebe, but I don't like aspire to look like them. I think they look awesome, but it's just not like I don't. But Sophia is just she always looks perfect. So like it's really does. Yeah, she could walk in anywhere and it's like she looks like cool, but appropriate. Like it's always. Yeah, she's just like so. She. Yeah. Yeah. And I try to not just copy her. And it's interesting that Delphine says the Olsen's because Delphine is so prep. She's French preppy, but she's so preppy and traditional and their style is so. Loose. Yeah. And I get a lot of inspiration from them, especially the stuff that they wear that's not the role because you're like, oh, they like that. They like that weird sneaker. That's interesting. But they are, I think because they're so diminutive. Is that how you pronounce that word? Yeah. That like everything is just sort of overflowing. That is as a person who is five eight, but Delphine is very like her clothes are very like sharp and tight, not tight in like fitting, but just like it's very sharp. Do you find that a lot of people when you, when it comes to celebrities are just like famous people who people are inspired by do a lot of people say the Olsen's and like how much are people using the row as like a big inspiration when they are buying stuff, even if it's not in their budget? There's a certain kind of person that I work with that like loves Olsen's and loves the row. Like it's a, it's probably like a pretty small percentage, but like the people that love them and love the row. Yeah. Like that's, that's what they want to look like. I was thinking about this the other day because my friend was saying like, how did these two girls from Full House like create like such a luxury brand? Like, like they want to meet ex-winnis them. I was like, I grew up with them like I'm a similar age to Mary Kate and Ashley. So like to me, my whole life, they were kind of like the pinnacle. So I wonder now, like if I would, if I would see their outfits now, like in the past two years out of context, I wonder if I would have any kind of response to them. I feel like I might not. I think it's just like growing up with them and like seeing all the different iterations of their style. I'm like, oh, they always know it's cool. So if they're wearing the row, like that's cool to me. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like I feel like it's less, at least for me, less about like, because even sometimes when I look at their current street style and I like, I'm kind of trying to dissect like, what is it that they're actually wearing? It's not like the most interesting pieces, but it is like, I think they're such a good example of styling. They're, it's like the way that they're putting things together is always so unique. And like you see like the total, the full picture instead of just like pieces when they're, when they're dressed, which I think is really interesting. Yeah. I've been talking about them with a lot of Europeans and because I think a lot of Europeans are like the stuff that they make is so basic. Why do people spend ridiculous amounts of money on it? And I had friends over the other night and I brought out three pairs of heels. One kitten, the almond toe pump they did. One, I think it's called the Charlotte pump, which is like a mid height, but like two and a half inches. It's not, I don't even think it's three very classic eighties pump. And then a really high nineties, definitely like a Prada high for me as four inch. Like I can barely walk in these. I wore them in New York. I don't know how I did survived. I, oh, actually I did walk barefoot on the cement a cup for like a few blocks because I was like, this is idiotic of me. Like a square toe suede pump. And the thing is that for, they, it's, is their taste. Like their taste is very American. It has the same, like they were educated in the way we were all educated, which means like not super bougie understanding of like, I don't know what their tutor was doing, the onset or whatever, but it's like the way Americans learn things, which is like not a huge focus on the arts. And they clearly had an interest in it. So really like did that for themselves and their proposals are very easy for Americans in particular, but I also think a lot of Europeans like it and obviously other places in the world, but it's been easy for Americans to like justify it because it is the best version of like the Teva, St. Black leather Teva sandal they do. I bought the doops or whatever they're called a couple of years ago and then I just got, then they were like $120 or whatever. I ended up not, I never actually bought the Teva sandals from them, but I think like they did the best version of that in a way that feels they just know exact. And like you're saying, you grew up with them and you have the same cultural references as them. A lot of people feel that way. And so they're able to take all this like extracurricular and all this education that they've clearly given themselves and apply it to something that like feels approachable to a lot of people. I was, before we got on the call, I was looking at boots and also they're, they have a new heel called the Lisa with two eyes and they have it in a dorset. They have it in a kitten heel. They have it in a, in a like mid heel pump. And I was like, Oh, I definitely need to get one of these. And there's no other shoe brand really that I'm like constantly buy. Like I buy one or two pairs from them every season. And so it is interesting how much they've, they've influenced like a whole 15 year generation of women and to dress like how they get dressed every morning. And none of the, I'd say probably 99.9% of them look nothing like the old sense look when they walk out the door. Yeah. It's like different interpretations of what they're wearing or like, you know, like picking out like what it is that you actually like about what they're wearing. But that's so interesting. Like you're right. It is like the best versions of things. So it's like almost like they'll take something so simple. They'll make it really elevated and really expensive. And then all the other brands that are like less expensive will kind of make that too. It's almost like going from the bottom to the top and then down again. Do you know what I mean? Yes. Like they really, I had a friend who's like not that, I mean, she's looks amazing, but like she's not like that into fashion. And she went to the road to buy a bag and she walked in. She's like, Oh, what do I do? I'm like, what do you mean? She's like, what do I even get? Like she like the clothes were like so confusing to her. She's like, like what? Like I need somebody to like explain everything. Even though it's like so simple. She's like, but like why? Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of like the Japanese and it's interesting. I think they really love this brand. You know that brand Arts and Science or Sciences, that Japanese brand. I think they've been very inspired by that brand and that brand stores in Japan are amazing. You can also buy it at Noodle Stories in Los Angeles and like a few other places in the U.S. But it is that idea of like, have you read this book, Amatora, about how Japan sort of co-opted preppy Ivy League style from the 1950s? And then it's really interesting. And my friend David wrote it, David Marks. It basically, and I highly recommend it for anyone who's just like interested in culture. He also wrote a book called Status and Culture, which is the like most straightforward about how like the things we buy, what they communicate to the world or what have you. And he's working on another really great book right now. But Amatora, I'd say 100% worth reading. And it's essentially about how in Japanese culture, and they do this with everything. Like you go to Japan to eat. You can eat great Italian food or whatever, because their sort of way of living is finding something they like and recreating it and doing it better than the original. And that's exactly what they've done. Like Amatora is essentially about how the Japanese took like Ivy League prep 1950s. You can just talk about raw denim and cone mill. Like that's it. And now Japanese denim, I need a pair of like denim, salvage, jeans. And I was looking on Levi's and it's Japanese denim. And so the row has taken that sort of approach of let's find the best thing and then make it better and then put it back out into the world. And then everybody copies that. It's a really interesting circle. But everybody copying it after is like really interesting. Like that part, I feel like is really interesting, you know. Yeah. So you started doing these online. So I want to talk about the copies because I'm curious what kinds of stuff your clients end up buying it when they're at different budgets. But when you started doing these videos online, it was like fast and furious because I remember still living in Brooklyn and my friends, Claire Mazer and Erica Cerulo talking about you on their podcast. I don't know if they had you on or not, but they were talking about you and there was a Harper's Bazaar profile of you, I think. Oh, yeah. Which I feel like was probably pretty early. Maybe I feel like I still lived in Brooklyn when it happened. That was pretty early. I was also living in New York during that. Yeah. Like just about my FaceTime session, like my FaceTime consultations, right? Yeah. So when did you start doing, I guess the pandemic means that a lot of stuff had to be virtual, but you've kept that to be, I assume that's a big part of your business. How did you kind of transition to doing more of these virtual consultations and how does it work now that we can be in real life? And I'm sure what you charge for those, you're very in demand, so you can charge a lot, but it's probably not the same as if you're going into someone's closet and ripping through it. Right. So during, like right before the pandemic, I had the idea of doing the virtual consultations just because I had, I was putting things online. I was showing like sort of the befores and afters of some of the clients that I saw in person and I was getting people messaging me being like, I live in Boston, like would you ever come here and do my closet? And I was like, I mean, like probably not. So I was trying to think of like a way to reach other people. And so I had the idea of doing virtual. And then once the pandemic hit, I was like, okay, like we'll just do it now. And I was skeptical because I was like, well, how can, like, you know, I won't be able to touch things. I won't be able to like really go into the closet, but it is really effective. And so I do like about five or six of those a day with people, which is really fun. And that allows me to reach like a lot of different people. Again, like a lot of different budgets, like people from all over the world. Like tomorrow I have a client in Thailand that I'm seeing at 7am because like the time difference. So I have like, you know, like it's, which is so fun for me. I get to like be in, you know, different countries. I get to just like meet all different kinds of people. So that's really amazing. And then I also do the in-person sessions like around LA or when I'm in New York, I'll do those too, which yes, I charge more for that. But the virtual sessions are so interesting and so fun for me. And I truly, I enjoy them so much. And I don't think I would be able to create content without having those. Because all of the content that I create is basically just like answering questions that I'm hearing all the time. So I'm kind of like gathering the data and like getting kind of the inspiration during the, the silent sessions and then figuring out a way to like message it out in a more broad way. Um, social media. You ever hit that moment when your kid asks for help with homework and you're like, wait, when did long division get this complicated? Or maybe your child's flying through lessons and getting bored in class. Yeah, been there. Web site. Yeah, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, you mentioned that people are like trying to have more bring more of a their personality to their wardrobes. Right now after this era of let's just get down to essentials and basics. What are some of the other like questions people are asking you right now or big issues? Do you find I guess one one from me is do you find that you're questions people are asking you right now are big issues. Do you find, I guess one, one from me is do you find, and this has come up a lot in my reporting, but also in these conversations we do on the podcast, do you find that a lot of women are trying to dress sexier or and I've gotten quotes or like more body con and yes. Yes. Okay. Yes. A lot, a lot. Yes. There's been like five people maybe in the past like months that have referenced Sylvie from Emily in Paris. She looks amazing. She really does. That like slinky, sexy. Yeah, I do think that is, I'm so, yes, that's exactly what people are wanting. That's a huge thing of just like, how can I bring again that personality back or like that sexiness or like that kind of like femininity in like a very powerful way. Why do you think that is? Do you think it is because we went through 10 years of dressing like monks? Probably. And I think it's also like, you know, like the baggy jeans and the big sweaters and like a lot of like, I feel like a lot of what we were looking for in like the past, maybe even just five years is like structure and like, you know, like that, like a structured white T-shirt and like a really like high-waisted structured pant. And I feel like now it's just kind of like going the other way where people want like a bit more of a drape. Like even just T-shirt trend wise, I feel like there was like, you know, everybody wanted that like perfect length, like pretty stiff white T-shirt that like had again that structure as kind of the keyword. And now I'm seeing that people are kind of going back to that like T by Alexandra Wang, original row, like soft, drapey, like almost sheer T-shirt. So even just like the T-shirt trend, I'm like, oh yeah, there is like that people want that drape and that sexiness and you can see your bra through it. Like, you know, it kind of hugs your curves as opposed to just being like really stiff, which like both are great. And like both I feel like are useful for different looks, but it is so interesting because nobody was asking for that for a while. Yeah, that's so interesting. What are some of the brands that you like recommend a lot for that sort of shift in the way we're all dressing? For like the sexiness. Yeah. It's a really good question. Well, OK, I guess it depends on like price and age and everything, but I feel like a lot of those like people are wanting like, I feel like for a while, like the going out top was like the best or like a blazer with a T-shirt. And now I think people are wanting again, like we're saying like that drape or like not a silk cami in the way that we used to wear, but like something like that. So I feel like a lot of those like Australian brands are like very good at those like like kind of like sexier tops. Like like posse. Yes. Like that ordered a bunch of stuff from them and none of it fits. So I just send it back and it was a big ordeal, but I do like that brand. It's cute. Yeah, that brand like sir, that like sir label brand has like sexy tops. Try like even like stodd. I feel like there's like a lot of that. But yeah, that sexiness. Is really interesting. But also I feel like a lot of that or a lot of what I talk about in those sessions, it's like, sure, we want to add in like a little bit more of that drape and a little bit more of those like sexy, silky pieces. But it's also like kind of like the way that you style the things that you have to make them feel a little bit sexier. Like before, let's say you would wear like a silk pant with like a really stiff, like kind of row style, like button down. And now I feel like people are wanting like this silk pant with like like a tighter top or like a silky button down. Like it's really, yeah, just kind of like figuring out how to how to adjust for that drape and sexiness. How much do people care about looking, clothes looking quote unquote flattering? So I feel like that word is like very charged in this way of it's almost like you're not supposed to want your clothes to look flattering, but people actually do. Yeah. And what does that mean exactly? And how do you sort of navigate? Because you are also dealing with like every single person, no matter how skinny they are has like body issues. Yes. And that's like, it's so disheartening in a way. But also I'm like, OK, like this is just like the female, like this is just how we are. And like, I don't really know how we can change it. And I have tried to be like, OK, like, what if we sort of didn't take out the idea of flattering, but just like put it lower on the priority list? Because sometimes I feel like the idea of flattering will sort of club what we actually like. You know what I mean? Like flattering will sometimes be number one. And it's like, OK, like do even like this or are we just trying to look great? But I don't. Conceptually, I've always like, OK, like let's forget about flattering because again, it's limiting. But I do understand like you want to look good and you want to look hot. And I like I totally understand that that that, you know, that consideration of flattering. But it's for me, it's more like flattering is fine. But it's the dressing for your body type that I find like kind of annoying and problematic. Like I think I've used this example before on social media. But like I have a large chest. So like, you know, I should be wearing like lower neck things or V-necks or scoop. But like I don't like those. And like if I was wearing a V-neck with a blazer, it would not be the same look as like a high crew neck with a blazer. So it's like, I feel like your style suffers a little bit when you're like too obsessed with like these rules for your body type. But then again, I do understand like you don't want to wear something that you don't feel amazing and you don't feel like hot in. So I don't know. It's that fine line. It's interesting. I feel like I'm not to bespurch the wrap dress because I think a lot of women look really good in them. Yeah. I obviously love TVF. But I think that that shape in particular, I have like a thick waist and I stuff that seemed at the waist is really flattering or whatever. And I feel really comfortable in. But anything that's like tied at the waist, I actually don't think it's flattering for me. It doesn't make me feel confident. And like I just think I need, I need like a shape to be created. And less of if you pull it together with a with a belt or or like something looser, like a tie, it's never worked. And I feel like for years that look was pushed on me because it's like, oh, it creates a waist, but it actually doesn't. And you have to. It's interesting, like even looking at photos or whatever, sometimes stuff that I feel really good in, it doesn't look perfect. But you have to do what you feel good in so that you can like go about the world feeling good and not worry so much about. I remember years ago, I was doing a shoot with like a video, an online video with a celebrity, and she was just obsessing over her legs looking too thin. And I just remember thinking like, man, it's everyone. And so you just can't like harp on it. It must a lot of your job must be like being like, don't harp on it. What's the point of worrying about this stuff so much? Like I I want to look nice and not look. Bad, but I also like don't want to spend too much time thinking about it, which is an interesting thing for someone who works in the fashion industry. But like people spend too much time worrying about how they look. It's crazy. 100 percent. And like, yeah, it's interesting, too. There's like some clients that I can tell like they almost want to be talked out of the insecurity. So like they'll be like, I feel like I can't wear this because like I don't like my knees, but like, what do you think? And then in that case, I'm like, you can wear it and like your knees look great. You know, like there I feel like people are more willing now to kind of be talked out of like silly things like that. But then also just I feel like a big portion of my job is really holding somebody's hand and being a cheerleader and saying like, no, like you're doing a really good job and you actually look great. You know, obviously, like I'm not going to tell somebody, you know, if somebody's asking my opinion and something looks crazy, like I will tell them in a nice way. But like, you know, like people want to just hear like you're doing a good job. You have good taste. You know what you're doing. Like just keep doing that because that confidence, I feel like is also really important in getting dressed and looking good. What has the book done for your business and your, your network? And question two is what does you don't have to give me your P and L, but what does your business look like? Like, are you, how do you structure it in terms of like, because you're doing a lot of, it seems like your business might be more of a volume business than a lot of stylists because you want to be affordable to a lot of different kinds of people, but that is, that requires more of you. So part one, like what has like the book done for you as in your career and the business and, and kind of getting the word out and be like, how have you structured the business so you can like stay sane, but still access people who can't afford you to come to their house or, or what have you? Yes. Okay. So the book I found was helpful because I was meeting all these people. Like I was saying, I see like six people a day. And a lot of times I'm saying the same thing, even if it's like a different problem, a lot of times it's a similar solution. So I found that the book is really helpful because I could put all of these solutions down and just, you know, have them all in one place. So if you can't afford a FaceTime session, but you still, you know, want to have access to me, like this is, you know, this is kind of what I'm saying. So that felt really good. It felt like really democratizing. I was, I was really happy to put that out. I also like, you know, I think of myself as a teacher. So like I love a lot of times when we'll get on a FaceTime session, like the client will have the book and they have read it and they've highlighted things and they have questions and they're like, well, can we like go into this part more? And like, I think that's also like, it's just like a helpful, it's helpful if you can't do a styling session, like it's a great resource, but also it's like a good sort of companion piece to a FaceTime styling session. Cause then you come in like understanding sort of like the principles. And then in terms of the way I structure my business, you're right. It is kind of like, it's more about volume. And I've, when I first started this business, everyone said, how are you going to scale it? How are you going to, it's like, I probably am not because I don't like, it's me. What do you like? I like that. Yeah. You don't have to get investors and have 50 stylists under you. If you do that, I'm happy for you. I'll, I'll write about it, but, but you don't have to. You can have this amazing life and help people and go on TV and. And I truly enjoy it. I really, really enjoy it. So I would say like the most time spent in my business is the styling sessions. And then I also do, you know, partnerships with brands and stuff like that. But I don't think I would be able to have the ideas or like, like the content to even work with brands if I wasn't meeting people every day. So I feel like those kind of go hand in hand. And then, yeah, the book is just like a nice little addition. Do you ever kind of take a survey with your, with your people and then take that data and, and consult with brands on the data that you've gotten from surveying all your clients? Well, if you haven't, you should do that. I was going to say like not in a formal way, but I do. I should in a more formal way. It's just more like, because there is right now, like the seasons are kind of changing, but like once we get into the colder months, it's like there are like trends that are more like questions that everybody's asking. Like last year, it was like, what boots do I wear with what shape of gene? Like that, like I would say 89% of people were asking that question. So like that's really helpful to know. But no, that's a good idea, because I do have like an interesting sample set and like, you know, obviously people are willing to sort of share that.

Every, I was just thinking about this for some reason when we were talking this dress that I bought for New Year's Eve a few years ago, a top shop or something. And I'm like, damn, I don't, I obviously don't have that. Like any, I stopped buying that fast fashion stuff because I would just get, end up getting rid of it and, but now I'm like, oh damn, I wish I still had that dress because it looked really good on me and it was like, it was a cute dress anyway. I want to look festive. I find it difficult because I'm not like a sparkle person. I don't like stuff with it. Also like one year I bought, do you remember when Kate was doing a lot of these, but I got this from Rachel Comey, the sheer, it was like sheared. It was sheer, a sheer top, but also like sheared fabric. Yeah. And they had like pin dot, like it would be like a spray of polka dots. I had this blouse from Rachel Comey that was beautiful. And I bought that for the holidays and I worked like two holiday parties. And then I probably sold it because I was like, I look silly in this. It's not for me. I just am not a person who is super comfortable with festive. And I also want something that if I'm going to buy it, like I have a pair of velvet pants from the row, I can wear those with stuff and dress them up. But I wear those like in the fall and the winter, it doesn't have to be holiday. They're just black velvet pants. Do you have any suggestions of, because I feel like people end up spending a ton of money on this festive stuff for the holidays and then they never wear it again and they're annoyed. And like, how do you approach party, holiday party, dressing around that time of the year? Yes. Okay. Like I understand the need and the want to be like, I want something fun and festive and like special. You know, I don't want to wear what I would just wear every day, but I do always ask, I'm like, what would you wear if this was just like a normal like cocktail party? And like, what can we add to that that maybe like adds a little bit of festiveness? Like, is it like some fun accessories? Is it like a shoe that you might wear again? Like for you, is it like those silk rope hands and that, or sorry, those velvet rope hands and then like, is it adding like a fun black silk blouse and maybe like a fun like rosette or a brooch or just, I don't know, like something like a little like fun and festive that you would wear again. I always ask myself and telcline to ask themselves, if I wear this to a holiday party and then I like go and meet friends for drinks after, like, well, I feel silly or will I still want to wear this? Cause I feel like a lot of times we'll get like really costuming in the holiday dressing and then like, you're like, yeah, I'm never going to wear this again. And I would actually feel kind of weird going someplace else other than this specific holiday party wearing that. So I feel like that's kind of a good test. Like what I want to get a drink after or what I feel like I don't feel that cool. So yeah, I guess that's not really answering your question, but I think it's just like adding like little details, accessories, shoes. Like again, if you're going to do like the velvet rope hands, like what, you know, can we add like a fun top to that? Can we add a fun top of them, put a blazer over to make it feel like you, I would just like go for like, what do you normally wear to a cocktail party? And then like, how can we sort of put it through like a slightly more festive lens that still feels like yourself? Yeah. I think that like what I feel silly afterwards is a great one for me. So final question, Allison. Yeah. What are your three words? Okay. So I like came up with my three words a long time ago when I, you know, came up with the concept and I feel like I'm going to need, I need to like re imagine them. So mine are like kind of basic. My first one's classic, which is normally one that I like don't really accept from people and like, okay, like let's figure out more. So like, I don't know why I'm allowed to have it, but classic 70s. Um, and then elegant, which you said too, like, and I don't know if that's like a New York thing where it's like, I feel at least when I was living in New York, I was like constantly frazzled, constantly doing a lot of things that I had to remind myself, like, let's like tighten this up. Like it's, we can look undone like an old symbol, like we don't want to look like insane or like messy or crazy. So I feel like that was always a good reminder for me. Yeah. I always want to look put together. Yeah. No matter what. I want like, I feel like there's a trend of like people always wanting to look effortless and like they didn't try and I'm like, no, I'm kind of the opposite. Like I want you to be like, wow, like you really, yeah, I want them to know that I thought about this look. Yeah. Alison, this was so fun. Lauren, thank you for having me. It was such a pleasure to get to know you more. Yeah. And congrats on all your success. It's really fun. I have a feeling your next phase is going to be even bigger. So I'm glad I caught you now.
