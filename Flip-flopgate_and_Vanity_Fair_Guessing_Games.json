Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Puck's Fashion and Beauty Memo Line Sheet. And today with me on the show is Brynn Wallner, founder of Dime Piece, live from the Upper East Side. We're talking watches and wonders, Vanity Fair, the Rose Flip Club Gate, and plenty more. Hi everyone, hope you're having a great week. I am recording this early because I'm flying to New York for a Puck event presented with Tishman Spire at Rock Center on Tuesday. I'll share more about that later in the week. And on Monday online sheet, there may be some breaking news. I am working on something right now that could break by then, but you never know. I've got lots of good stuff happening, more sacks, more Vanity Fair, more Balenciaga, a fear of God scoop on Tuesday. Sarah Shapiro is going deep on Urban Outfitters. On Wednesday, Richard Struegatz has a huge beauty scoop. It's all happening. Let's get going with Brynn. Brynn Wallner, welcome to Fashion People. Bonsoir, Lauren. Bonsoir. Where are you coming from? Where you just landed in New York I hear? Yes, currently back on the Upper East Side where I just moved. I've heard it too. It's a big movement. It's very trendy, yes. So I'm in New York in my new apartment, but I'm also fresh from Geneva where I was for a whole week for Watches and Wonders, which is my biggest work week of the year and also that of the entire watch industry. So what did Watches and Wonders used to have a different name? Yes, so it used to be S-I-H-H. But then there was also Basil World. So these are two separate trade shows. And S-I-H-H was run by Richemont and Basil World was everything else. And then this was before my time because I came into the watch industry in 2020. But I heard that there were some murmurings about things that just weren't working and it was getting too overcrowded at Basil. And then the pandemic hit and it was kind of the chance to hit the reset button. So they kind of merged. And there in 2022, Watches and Wonders was born. And that's most of the watch brands excluding the Swatch Group, which is Omega and Longin and other brands. But over 60 brands were exhibiting this here, which is, I think, a record high. How? Yeah. Are there a lot of new brands right now coming out or are they all, or are there brands that are old that are sort of being dusted off? Like why were there so many? Yeah, that's a good question that I don't even know myself. I know that there are lots of new brands, micro brands, independents, but then older brands that are kind of getting revitalized. But like I said, I'm still newish to the industry. So my priority is the big heritage brands whenever I'm there because obviously you can't see 60 brands in a week. And most people are only there like four days maximum because then it turns into the public days, which is also a new thing. Like this has always been a trade only thing, journalists, retailers, buyers. And now there are two, I think three additional days that have been tacked on in the past couple years for the public. And those have been really high traffic days and people have to pay to go. It's not invitation only. So it's kind of indicative of like Watches gaining this bigger presence and the popular imagination and becoming really a destination. That's so interesting. Is it like sort of like the Detroit car show? I've never been, but I heard American cars are coming back. I guess so depends on what happens tomorrow or in the day after. And the day after every day is different. Every day, what a surprise. And I was wondering how long we'd get in this conversation with them without mentioning the big T word. Oh my God. I don't know what you're talking about. Neither do the Swiss launch brands. That's interesting. So what did it, because you Watches and Wonders, that it fell right amid April, April 2nd, liberation day, the day where all these tariffs were announced, including a 20% blanket on the EU that I'm still on convenience. We're recording this Sunday night and this weekend Musk was like, you know, there just shouldn't be any taxes between the EU and the US. I was like, Oh, we'll see what happens on April night or whatever. But what was the reaction when you were going around to the different brands talking to people? Was everyone just talking about tariffs the whole time? Or were they not super worried about it? Yeah, I mean, the Swiss watch industry is not one to wear their heart on their sleeve. And there's not a lot of, you know, people are acknowledging that this is a looming threat. And obviously, you know, it's written on a wall. It's, if you look at the charts, Switzerland is going to be hit with a 31% levy. And so that's pretty high. And so, you know, people seem to be spooked. And it's really depending on who you're talking to, like I was talking to a smaller brand and he's like, I asked him straight off, I'm like, what are you doing to protect yourself? And he's like, well, we sent all our orders out early, because if they're in transit, they can't be affected before April 9th. And we're just going to hope for the best. But then what you were kind of saying earlier, it's like, you really just can't predict what's going to happen. It's kind of like the TikTok date and switch, like who knows who knows who's shaking hands with who behind the scenes, like this could all turn out to be, you know, be reversed. And it's just one day at a time as the alcoholics like to say, yeah. Yeah. Oh, I think this is the first AA reference ever on fashion people. Oh my God. So, interestingly, I was talking to someone today who brought up the point. Yes, I was, it's Sunday and I was talking to someone about work. You know this job, you just, you know, it never ends. I love my work so much. So one thing that was mentioned that I thought was a really good point in terms of luxury, this person was like, I don't think that the luxury brands and watches are a little different. So we could kind of go into how they're priced. But I don't think the luxury brands are going to, the prediction was like most of the prices are going to go up about 10%. And the idea is like, yeah, that's not, it's not nothing. But right now, I was looking at Eli addresses on my Teresa today and they were all like $3,500, $4,000. So what's another 400 bucks to onto that, like that type of thing. And then also the landing cost of these things is different than obviously what the customer pays. So what a lot of these retail brands do is they sell the product to their American subsidiary. So say Chanel bag costs $2,500, Chanel US may only be paying, I don't know, $1,800 for it or whatever. The point being that the taxes are going to actually be lower, it's not going to be on the full price or even the price that they're sending to wholesalers. So say they're charging, say a bag costs $5,000 and they're charging the retailer $2,500 for it in a wholesale deal, their subsidiary is only paying $1,800. So you really only get to get putting that new tax or that new tariff on the $1,800, not the $5,000. So it's, I mean, it's not nothing, but it is something to think about with luxury goods, I think with cheaper stuff, it's not as easy. But yeah, do you think with watches, because watches are so particular and they're so the way they control the distribution so in such a specific way that a lot of people who buy watches will just buy them in Europe or get around it? Yeah, I was sharing a cab to the airport with an editor this morning, the Geneva airport. And he was like, these high net worth clients, these are the people who are buying $15,000 and not watches, which I feel like $15,000 is even on the low end these days for the big watches, they can just buy them in Europe. So why even go to the US? But what makes this interesting is that since 2021, since the pandemic, the US has emerged as the Swiss luxury watch industry's highest consumer group. So the biggest amount of Swiss watch exports are going to the US and we superseded China after the pandemic. So what does that mean if all of a sudden the US went from the highest consumer group to now we're buying these watches elsewhere? Like I don't know what happens in that weird dynamic. Yeah, it means that Europe is the same thing with luxury goods generally. I think that 2022 was Louis Vuitton's like best year in the US ever and Elvia made should became a one it was sort of battling with China in the late 2010s overall, Elvia made as US and China split in terms of what was a bigger market. And I think now US is bigger again or was and we'll see. But yeah, it's a real it's a real problem. What do you attribute other than you and dime piece? Because you definitely have inspired a new generation, not only of women, I would say of men to think about watches. And we've seen sort of a move away from just buying fashion in the first half of the 2020s to buying hard luxury jewelry and watches. And I think as people on the wealthier end, their wealth amassed, and they got all that crypto money, they were like, I want to spend it on something that'll last. But what do you attribute it to I have this theory that the Apple Watch came out in, I believe 2014 and a lot of people who had never owned watches bought them. And it took me, I got one. I had never worn a watch as an adult, really not even as a younger person I had tried, but never like got into it. And I wore the Apple Watch up until 2021. And then it started weirdly, even though I was at home, maybe because I was on zoom all the time. I started to feel like I had outgrown and I got the Hermes Apple Watch, which I like, it's super lovely, bad and everything. But by 2022, I turned 40 and got one. So, and now I never wear the Apple Watch. I went for a run today and I was like, I don't want to even I wanted to do speed work. But I was like, you know what, I actually don't care, because I don't want to start getting the watch line. It's summer in LA already. So I'm just curious from your perspective, like, what do you you started Dime Piece in 2020? How did you get into watches? And what do you think the sort of turning point was for this new generation of collectors to come about? Yeah. So how I got into watches, I mean, before 2019, I didn't even know any watch brand besides Rolex. I mean, Rolex is the household name. And even then, I didn't know anything about Rolex other than my dad had one in the 80s. And I think I knew of its presence abstractly sitting in some, you know, drawer gathering dust, he never even wore it. So I got a job at Sotheby's in 2019. I was on their editorial team and I was brought on to create content to bring a younger audience onto their website. And the watches department saw what I was doing and wanted me to kind of give that treatment to that category. Because, you know, in the grand scheme of the auction world, watches are easier to buy and ship and, you know, maybe they're less money than a Picasso. And so they kind of were like, okay, you can create some cool content around watches. I commissioned out all that writing, but I had to edit these pieces and learn about them and learn about these, these greatest of all time watches. And I became very fascinated by them. I think it was a mixture of like history and culture and style. And also, it's just so rich. And so I became fascinated by them. I started seeing them everywhere in TV shows and movies and on the subway. And yet I was shocked that it took me this long to get into watches and I was about to turn 30. And I was like, how is it that I don't even have a watch on my radar as the 30th birthday present? Like I'm not even aspiring to own one. How did the industry screw up this bad? Because I'm looking at myself as a representative of a demographic that's, you know, about to turn 30. I live in New York City. I have this great job. And how is it that none of my friends and I care about watches? Like that's a huge miss. And I do think it's been very male dominated, of course, but also I think the advertising has been pretty inspiring. And so to bring it to the pandemic, I got Let Go by South Abyss. They got acquired by Patrick Drawhee. And a ton of people got Let Go. I got Let Go the day of the pandemic. It was a big introduction in New York City, like when people were starting to line up at grocery stores. But South Abyss shout out, they gave me some, they gave me some severance. And so I had time to really think about what I wanted to do and reprioritize. And I was about to turn 30, like I said. So I said, I want to watch and I started Dimepeace kind of as a personal research project. Like, I didn't know what to buy. I had no idea what my taste was. And I also knew there was a gap in the market for women and watches and kind of content created towards that. And before I knew it, I was getting hit up by Nikki Oganake at Harper's Bazaar and she wants me to be their monthly watch columnist. And I'm like, oh, shit, now I really need to learn about watches. But kind of, you know, since then, I launched a website, I've written for numerous different outlets. This is my fourth watches and wonders. And, you know, in 2021, there was this huge spike in prices of watches on the secondary market. So as I was coming into the watch world just by chance, the pandemic hit, and wealthy people are starting to spend a lot more money on watches, you're seeing, you know, records breaking at auction across the board. This is huge, like, you know, particularly Nautilus, which would retail for $35,000 is going for like, like $235,000. And people are seeing this and their eyes are popping out of their skulls. And it's generating all these headlines. And then we have the pandemic where people are like, what does it all mean? And somebody like you who's had an Apple watch and, you know, a lot of watch people, or a lot of people like to assume that watch people hate the Apple watch. But I think that, Lauren, your, your instinct is correct here that it's actually a win for the industry and that it got watches on people's wrists. So, you know, in this time when we don't need wristwatches. So, yeah, but the pandemic kind of induced screen burnout, the headlines that these watches were making, you know, creators quote unquote, such as myself on social media presenting kind of like fresh perspectives on this very exclusive, very once very stuffy kind of industry and product is now being seen anew with all this buzz around it. And I think, you know, the the pivot to hard goods, people just want something to invest in. And I don't know, when you bought your first watch, were you like, this might be a good investment for me? Did that even come into the consideration? It definitely did. It was kind of a thing. Weirdly, I don't know if it's living in New York for all those years, and also being a fashion writer from the beginning and writing about luxury goods from the beginning, from the beginning, I have very little price sensitivity when it comes to clothes and handbags and shoes and things like I'm, I, which doesn't make sense because they, they depreciate a very rare does a handbag maybe will appreciate guy bought a Chanel bag in 2010, I bet that that is much more valuable than it like I could probably sell it for more than I paid. But generally, that's not the case. I would say that moving to Los Angeles and having a home and thinking more about things. Also, I don't need any more clothes. So, and the clothes got less interesting. I mean, the, the, the intersection of the clothes and the handbags and stuff getting less interesting intersected with the pandemic, pandemic intersected with people wanting to spend more money on their homes and furniture and things. And then also, if I'm going to buy something, yeah, I don't, I would, I would love for it to have a value at some point, but I also feel I know enough about diamonds, for instance, to know everything is a construct. So it, but it definitely was a thing of like, if I'm going to buy myself something, and this was my birthday gift for my 40th, but like, if I definitely want more watches now, I want to get a couple other, like I would do vintage I did, I just went, my husband just went to the store and bought one for me. I don't think I would do that again. I probably do second hand, but yeah, I think that like, it just felt like you said it's very rich. There, that can mean a lot of things, but the one thing it means is the experience is richer. Like the feeling every time I put that watch on, I feel really good and it feels special. And I don't have a lot of fancy jewelry. I have like one gold necklace that's not super fancy, my wedding ring, my engagement ring, I love them, but they're not fancy at all. But that watch is like, and it's, you know, it's, it's modest, but it feels really special and makes me feel good in a way that like a piece of fashion probably can't anymore. And I think a lot of people feel that way. Yeah, I mean, I feel the exact same way. It's the cherry on top of my outfit. And it's kind of the elevator because I'm like you, I don't have a ton of fuel.

So we have a couple other topics I wanted to dig into with you. But first off, if you are chatting on your friend on the phone on the way home from the airport, what were the sort of big picture other than the big T? What were the other T? What were the trends that you saw? Did any brand really stand out to you specifically of winning this week? It's funny, I had a friend who went to CinemaCon this week. Just another trade show where the, and Matt Bellany, my colleague at Puck, did a podcast about this with my friend Amanda. But they basically, all the studios go and present trailers of the movies they're going to have to the movie theaters. Sounds awesome. I was like, I would like to go to this trade show. It's in Vegas. So what were the big, and they had their big takeaway of what happened at CinemaCon, but what were the big trends from Watches and Wonders? Like what did you take away from the week? Yeah, absolutely. Well, if I was on the phone with my friend, if I were on the phone with my friend, I would set the scene first. So just to give the outsiders an idea of what Watches and Wonders is like. The scale is just mind boggling. So you're at this trade show kind of convention center, maybe like a million times the size of the Javits Center, and you walk in and everything is dialed. Like you have these people, these greeters and uniforms, you have super high security. It's all kind of facial recognition. People with signs, all the shuttle buses they're taken care of. There's a cloakroom. There's a place where you could put your suitcases. There's security. It's like before you even walk in past the security area, it's already a huge projection. And then you walk in and it's, people call them booths, but booth is such a small word compared to what you're actually seeing, which is these structures that the brands have built that are only supposed to last for the week and they're the size of houses. So the Rolex and the Patek Philippe booths quote unquote are multi-story buildings. They're bigger than brownstones in Brooklyn and they have full on reception centers and people greeting you and plants and running water. And there are stairs and different rooms and you have to check in and then you're swept past the reception area into a waiting area and then you go into a smaller room and you see the quote unquote novelties, which is what we're all gathered around to see, which are the novelties. And so you take the Rolex novelties and these are arguably always the biggest of the year. They're the ones that everybody anticipates. Everybody wants to see what Rolex is coming out with. Rolex had a really interesting new product this year called the Land Dweller. So you may have heard of the Sea Dweller and then in 2012 Rolex introduced the Sky Dweller and now for the first time since 2012, this is a completely new Rolex model and it's called the Land Dweller. And it's the 70s inspired design. It's kind of a baby. If the oyster quartz and a date dress had a baby, it would be the Land Dweller and it's got this fancy new bracelet and this beautiful new movement and everybody was kind of losing their minds over that in part because it was leaked. So this is another thing about watches and wonders and just the luxury world in general, but I feel like the word embargo is like tattooed in my mind and you don't want to break the embargo and yet some people do. So prior to the Land Dweller release, the official release, I don't know who, but somebody leaked these really blurry kind of sad photos of the watch and I think it's funny. And yeah, and this kind of happens, but it's always a little disappointing and like everybody's just like, but then it kind of like sets the rumor mill aflame like what is that new watch and then Rolex had kind of a controlled leak where it was Roger Federer wearing the Land Dweller like petting a puppy or something. This was a week ago. I don't even remember the image, but so we kind of knew what was coming and then you get to see them in person or in the medal as the watch nerds like to call it. In the medal. I love it. I mean the lingo is crazy, but yeah, so the Land Dweller I think was the biggest release of the fair and it's polarizing. And I will say that if you look at the history of watchmaking, all the huge heavy hitters now like the Audemars, Piquet Royalau or the Patek Philippe Nautilus, the fans were not fans of these watches and now these are the most important watches that you could buy today, fetching the highest on the secondary market. So we'll see what happens with the Land Dweller, but it's polarizing for sure the way that it looks. I think it's a very loud watch. The dial itself is very loud and kind of flashy and this is not something subtle. This is not stealth wealth. This is not what you would wear if you're wearing the row. But then there's also the Cartier. The Cartier releases, they always have a ton that appointment always lasts like an hour because there are so many different watches to look at. And the big showstopper from the Cartier bunch was a watch called the Tank Guichet, which... Parlez-vous français l'un? A little. I speak LVMH French. Moi aussi. You already know. Anyway, Guichet means window. So it's like this kind of fanciful design from 1928, reimagined for now. And it's a jumping hour complication, which we don't even need to get in the weeds with that. But just know that the Tank Guichet was Cartier's biggest launch this year and it's what everybody's talking about. And I can go on and on. Well, you mentioned that you wouldn't wear that Rolex watch with a look from the row. And I did want to talk to you about these flip flops from the row that are $690. But before that, pricing-wise, you mentioned that $15,000 is not that much for a watch in the grand scheme of things at this point. Has the pricing gotten crazy the way it has with luxury goods in the last few years? Yeah. And I've been wanting to kind of dig more deeply into this. I know that the pricing has gone up on the primary market. So I think that the Landweller, for example, the lowest price reference of that, it's steel and it's $13,300. But it gets tricky because you see that price and you're like, oh, okay, cool. Yeah, for a new Rolex. And you may know this and the listeners may know this, but you can't just go into a Rolex boutique and buy a Rolex. It's not happening for you because you're not in the system. It's the Hermes Birkenbag model. Is there any? Because there you can go into Hermes and get certain bags in certain stores, not every store. But there are certain, I know someone who bought an Hermes and was like, I just walked in and I said, well, show me which bag you bought and they showed me. And I was like, well, that's why. But I'm not going to say which bag it was. But all Hermes bags are great. But could you buy some? Because when my husband did not buy me a Rolex, he bought me, but from one of the big houses, a watch that I would think would be desirable to me. Women who have seen challengers if you want to have a hit. But is it that you just can't buy any? Or can you go in and will there be some models? There will be some, maybe like one ladies watch kind of sitting sadly in the corner with her diamonds. Got it. Nothing that you either of us would want to buy. Or maybe you and I would want that watch, but a big collector or a watch guy. Or even just a guy with $15,000 to spend on a on a Submariner, which, you know, even, I don't know how many years ago, like seven years ago, you could just walk in and buy that watch. And now it's out of the question. So yeah, but you kind of get yourself into the system, you get yourself on a weight list and that's kind of luck of the draw or not. Oh man, well, best of luck to everybody who's trying to buy watches. Yeah. And you know, those who knows where those tariffs where we're going to feel them. And also it's going to hit the secondary market as well. So, Most supplement brands on the market only focus on one area of women's health, like energy or hair health.

The style section did a very fun conversation between Jacob Gallagher, Stella Bugby, his editor, and then Misty Weissadel, who is their shopping columnist. Misty and Jacob have both been on fashion people. Misty used to write for me years ago, so I've known them all three of them for a long time. But they had a nice conversation about these flip-flops from the row that look like Javianas, but really good colors. They are $690. Check them out. I am just curious. They had a very interesting conversation. It was edited, and it was clearly very tight the way it was organized. I don't have... I would say I'm a person that if I like something and I do think the row does the best version of everything, I will buy it, even if the price seems a little crazy. If I can afford it, not going to debt, and be able to pay my son's tuition, maybe I will partake. But I would say that... I don't know. You live in New York City. It feels like a repeat of the jellies from last summer where everybody's jellies were falling apart. I haven't lived in New York for five years, but all I know is that my shoes last so much longer now than they used to. I can wear... I have foreign heels that I wear occasionally. It's just made my life so much richer from a shoe perspective because... But I just don't know in a world... I also hate flip-flops, and I would never wear them in any circumstance ever because they're so uncomfortable to me. But do you think this is going too far? I mean, it does feel like they're laughing at us, kind of, doesn't it? But the one thing I will say is that one of them, and I can't identify which one, has been photographed in these. So I don't know if they actually buy anything from themselves. I assume they do, probably at a very deep discount. I don't think they just... Usually with these kinds of companies, you still have to make a purchase even if you're the owner. But I don't think the upper is fabric, which is nice. The lining is rubber. The sole is rubber and sole. And they're made in Italy. Yeah. So I don't think... They're not terrible. They're not bad. They're not going to be junky. But also made in Italy can mean a lot of things. You could just buy the materials and then assemble them in Italy. But would you engage with these even on the secondhand market? Well, no, because kind of what you were saying with the jelly, once it becomes a conversation piece and there's kind of a tee profile on it, and then there's the cut article that's kind of poking fun at it, then I just feel like it's just going to become one of those things, like the Mew Mew super short skirt or something that you kind of see everywhere. So I personally wouldn't partake, but I wouldn't be surprised if I see them around. I mean, I will say I know that MKNA, they love their Havayanas. I feel like I still have my navy blue pair and that's somewhat influenced by them. And my mom, she's very loyal to her flip flops. So some people love flip flops, but yeah, I mean, they're going to get grimy though and NYC. Yeah. I have resorted to buying black Chakos because they're very similar to a style that Hermes did that I would have totally bought and was very high quality. I just never got around to it for whatever reason. But yes, I think the other thing that the row does is they do inspire people to buy Tevas or Chakos or whatever their, whatever like traditional shoe they are riffing on, they make that a bigger thing. And you know, every single brand that makes flip flops is going to do a red flop with a black strap. Yeah. And that way it's kind of exciting just to see the ripple effect. For sure. I also, I will say I'm looking at them on my Teresa and they have like a style this outfit and they had a pair of jeans that a Glitta wide leg jean, which is, I actually think I own these in, I own them in something. And then the one thing you'll say is the white T-shirt, the row T-shirt $550. That honestly is not that much for a T-shirt at this point. The Wall Street Journal did a thing about how there are $1,000 T-shirts. Everything is 500 for a T-shirt is like the new 100 for a T-shirt. So I have, I actually don't own any T-shirts from the row, especially not any white. And I don't think I've ever owned a T-shirt from the row unless I got it at like off price or something, lowman's or something like that. But I'm looking at these T-shirts and they've got like a butter yellow one. They've got a cream one. They're really nice. You might turn into a row T-shirt girly. I mean, I would absolutely never. I famously do not spend money on clothes and watches. So not famously, but people are always asking me what my next blodge purchase is going to be. And I'm just like, I don't know. I don't think. You feel you give off a very East Coast, I don't need to spend money person. Yeah. I mean, I mean that in like huge compliment. I took it as a compliment. So thank you. And I mean, you know, I'm living on the upper east side now. That's the way to live. This is the way to be. You can't be spending money on silly silly flip flops. So you need to, you know. So the one other thing I wanted to talk to you about, I thought it would be a fun, a fun conversation was last week, the editor in chief of Vanity Fair, Radhika Jones stepped down on Thursday and it was very dramatic. And it's basically been the most fun story for me because I cover the media only from the sort of fashion media perspective. Essentially legacy publishing, which is mostly Kandey Ness and a little bit of Hearst and dip into refinery 29 there every once in a while. But Radhika stepped down. I got, it was just, it was basically my text even today. Like every single person just wants to talk about this. It has information, has theories. This is who it is. This is who it is. I wrote about it on Thursday in line sheet, then I followed up on Friday in line sheet. Thursday's line sheet is for inner circle members only. So it's a higher tier of subscription. So you, I used to only publish two days a week. Now I publish five days a week. If you want that Thursday day, you have to pay a little extra. So there were a lot of people who didn't realize I had also written about it on Thursday and they were like, why didn't you mention this person on Friday when I had already mentioned them? So the reality is there are a lot of candidates. The candidate pool seems, I wouldn't say wide or deep, but it is, it is filled. It's a small pool, but it's very crowded. I'm curious from your perspective, and there will be more on Monday because this is just, this story is a gift to me. So I'm looking forward to tracking the travails of Condé Nast and what happens with this media property. Who do you think would be a great editor-in-chief of Vanity Fair? Who would you like to see? Well, I must admit that this is all news to me. I was deep in the trenches of the watch world, hardly stepping out of that bubble. And then I realized I missed an email from you earlier today because I was literally at JFK customs. So, but geez, I don't know. I'm like Willa Bennett. I don't know. I want to hear what you think. Okay. So it's been a journey. Okay. At first, I really didn't know and I was just, the first person that kind of came up in talking to people as a potential candidate is Marc Guaducci, who is the Creative Editorial Director of Vogue. And he's worked at, he was an assistant of Vanity Fair years ago. He was the editor of Garage magazine when that existed. Adasha Zukova owned it. He has been a Vogue for a long time. He's an interesting person. He kind of runs Vogue World and also a lot of, I don't know, outside projects or things where you have to organize a lot of people and get a lot of people involved. So when there were, during the pandemic, when Vogue did that cover with a single rose or whatever, I think he was deeply, he's really involved in the covers. Like he has a lot when there is, when you need to orchestrate things, he's really, really involved with concepts and coming up with like big ideas, that sort of thing. And he is definitely one of Anna's most important sort of inner circle at the moment. And whoever is the Editor-in-Chief of Vanity Fair will report to Anna and we'll be connected to her. And it sounded like there was just a lot of outside campaigning for him immediately. So I don't think it's out of the question. I don't think that, we're recording this on Sunday, I don't think we will, and Radhika is staying on through June. I don't think they have an answer yet and I could be wrong. It could, they could totally know. I have not spoken to Anna Wintour about it, but I think they have, they are thinking about it and she's certainly thinking hard about it because she has made some wrong decisions in terms of hiring. One of the right decisions she's made is promoting Will Welch to be Editor-in-Chief of GQ in 2018. Will was a very early people started saying, oh, it's going to be, maybe it'll be Will, maybe it'll be Will. And I initially really dismissed that because Will, A, is very important to the GQ brand. The GQ brand globally has had some challenges because of GQ China and troubles there that you can read about in Line Sheen. We don't need to go into here, but I just assumed he has too much on his plate. And I also see when you think about succession at Kandinash, generally that Will will eventually replace Anna as the Chief Content Officer and sort of managing all the brands. But then another person mentioned to me, well, wouldn't it make sense for him to own Vanity Fair now and also still own GQ and own Pitchfork, which obviously is a tremendous amount of responsibilities, the Pitchfork of it all. But so I think, and then there are the outside people are sort of Sarah Moonves, editor of W Magazine and is very close with Anna and is a potential, but she part owns W. And so there would be, she'd need to figure that out. And I just see if she's going to do that and go back to Kandinash, I just see her as the successor at Vogue. So I don't know if that is exactly it, but you never know. Like these people are smart. And then there are also ideas out of, I am a big fan of Stella Bugby's. I think she would be great. I've heard, I was told by people that the editor of New York Magazine, David Haskell has already said he's not going to do it. So there are some outside players in my mind right now as we're speaking. Then there is also the chance that it is someone who no one is excited about, because there have been a lot of appointments at Kandinash that have not been exciting and have felt kind of not right. But I think now that I think about it more and have had more time, I think A, whoever is in line is going to have to present a really ambitious idea about how they can make this magazine relevant again without even as much money as Radhika has had. So it's going to be do more with less and make it interesting and also make it palatable to advertisers. So that's a big project and someone is going to have to present in the same way I'm sure Willa Bennett did when she went to Cosmo, present something really impressive. And I think they're going to have to want it very, very badly. I'd say on paper, if no one was doing a project, the smartest thing for Anna to do would be to give Will Vanity Fair and then let Will put someone at GQ US who he really trusts, but he still be the sort of global content officer of Vanity Fair, GQ and Pitchfork. And so that seems like from a business perspective, Will is a proven quantity from business. He's been very successful. He did the right thing with GQ. He made it an enthusiast magazine instead of being general interest. And that worked. He'd have to figure out the right point of view for Vanity Fair in this era. But I do think at this point in time, he feels like the right person. That said, they could end up hiring someone who is an unknown and just kind of let Vanity Fair shrink even further. But my money right now, I think is on Will. But it also depends if he really wants it. I heard from people this weekend that said he's going for it. It's happening. But this is just speculation for now. And so his life would change again. So we'll see. And Radhika, who by all accounts essentially, except for some people who work there who would like to believe that she got fired by all accounts, she did quit and has been thinking about quitting for the last year. But I think it was the kind of quitting where what choice did she really have? And so I don't, I think there's no love loss on any side. And it was sort of a conscious, uncoupling type situation. Absolutely. This is so fun. Oh, thank you. And thank you for enduring my jet lag. I hope that I was cooking right. You were fabulous. You're so well spoken.
