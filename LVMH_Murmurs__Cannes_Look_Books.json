And joining me today on the show is Becca Wischiani, the founder of your favorite fashion news account, StyleNotCom. We're talking Louis Vuitton Resort. We're talking Cannes, Best and Worst Dressed. We're talking all these indie brands that are kind of failing what's going on with them. And of course, the rumor of the week. Let's get started. Hey everybody. Hope you had a great day off if you were in the UK or the US. You can now officially wear white. Can you believe that that used to be a rule and that people followed it? Now guys just wear white jeans all year long, including my husband. Here's to wearing white in the winter. Last week, I was in LA and I kind of chilled out in anticipation of the holiday. I only went to one event. It was my friend Melanie, who is the founder of Gia, which is a non-alcoholic drink that is actually pretty good. I prefer mixed vodka, but it's good. It's very low sugar, so if you watch your sugars, it's good. She hosted this event at essentially a stand-up dinner at the Cezanne showroom in Los Angeles. So Cezanne is this very chic, affordable fashion brand out of Paris. And the founder, Morgan, has a very big business in the US and they have this sort of set up in LA in particular. She had a bunch of people over. Gab Waller, the really famous personal shopper was there. Unfortunately, I missed her, but thanks to Instagram. I knew she was there. Holly List, who is, she's been doing social media forever and is kind of out and about in LA, is an adjacent fashion person and we had never met in person, so it was fun. It was a lot of people who I know from Instagram and I met in person, but it was just a really nice event. And I don't know, Cezanne, I think they were just said to Melanie, like, invite your friends. This wasn't, I wasn't invited there to cover it or anything like that. There really weren't any other fashion media, but it was just really nice. And I think it's smart when brands do stuff like that. On Monday, I did publish, even though it was a holiday, but it was a mailbag and check it out if you haven't. These are very popular with the, the line sheet readership. So we talked to Anna Wintour succession. We talked a bunch of other stuff, including apparently VF Corp has hired a banker to sell Supreme, talked about the future of Glossier. And I love doing these. I'll do them probably three times a year. I think I did one or two last year. If you have a question for me, send it to me now because I'll file it away, but also maybe I, you know, there's a story in there. And I want to do a big shout out to line sheet reader, Martha, who actually texted me and asked me a question. And I, it was very funny and, and cool that she took the initiative and I was able to answer it. So thanks, Martha, for being proactive. And as always, you all have my number at this point. I'm not going to repeat it, but feel free to call me. So today we have Becca from stown.com on as you all know, he just signed with CAA. He already had a manager. Now he has an agent. He is a thing. He is a piece of culture. And so now he has a big agent in Hollywood, wheelie and dealing for him. I hope he comes out here to visit me and, and see what the fashion scene is like on the West coast, but we had a really great conversation and I, I hope you enjoy it. Becca, thank you for being here. I know how busy you are. Yes, but, uh, I mean, this is the evening time now. And with you, I mean, I can never say no to the conversation. With you. Just, it would be like few minutes during, between after the shows or podcasts or like anything. I feel like it's always something that we are both catching each other. Yes. And that's why thank you for having me and congrats for this. I mean, we don't realize sometimes when we have projects like your newsletter or your podcast that we actually needed them. Thank you. It's like, it's the same for you. This is why we love each other. I think it's the right timing because this missing and I love how it starts. Like, you know, I'm obsessed with the news and the way of podcasts, it could be like the radio talk show in a way that I remember from my childhood when they were discussing stuff. This was when I first turned in your first episode, I was like, okay, this is something very in a way like nostalgic for me in terms of how it sounds. Because it was like sitting in the room and hearing just like friends who, but mostly like you understand what they're talking about. That's the most important. Yeah. Totally. And the thing for me that I want to do and I feel that you are similar is take the good of old media that people still want and then package it and deliver it in the new way of media, which is exactly what you've done, which is you've taken fashion news and you package it in a way that people actually want to read. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. But it's been for me. I told you also in past and I always repeat that this is the format that I would want to read myself from someone else. And when I did not find it, I said, okay, maybe I should talk about this. So learning through the process, also finding out so much stuff just for me and my brain that is always trying to find something new from not just from the present for also from the past, because this industry is like everything is connected to the past. I felt that I did it for myself to do it during my free time, but then appears there were like few hundred more thousand people who wanted to read the same way. A few hundred. You know, you know who complimented you? I was at Savannah College of Art and Design a couple of weekends ago and Dirk Stanton, the former editor and chief of the sell.com. I have a super shortly I will tell the story. Last New York fashion week when I first came to New York, I was living in Tom Brown's show and if you went there, you remember what was the weather after like the we like the storm almost started. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I had car waiting to take me to the airport and my driver could not get in. So I was just standing and freezing. And suddenly someone comes does like like on my shoulder and says like, hi, Becca, and I look at him and I've like the face is familiar. But like, I didn't want you to ask, OK, who are you? Because I've seen him. He's a tall, kind of scary man. Style.com and I swear. I don't know, like I almost jumped from the happiness that actually so randomly. I met him and it was like he was running. I was running because I had to make it to my flight. But then he mentioned me immediately. He typed his phone on my number, but then driver called. So this number got deleted and I made a post saying that, dear, if you're reading this, can you please send me your phone number? So someone from his team, they sent me the number. Then he invited me to the graduation show as well. But I mean, to go to US in between because my passport was again UK Embassy those days to get the UK visa for my next travels. So I could not come, but we promised that we are meeting in September during Fashion Week to just talk about each other for like a few minutes because there is no one. I mean, when you already met Tim Blanks and Nicole and everyone, there is no one else left. No, agreed. They're the best. I heard and read that you had a good time there. You got to go. I'm inviting myself again next year. You got to go. I promised Dirk that Tim would also go. Oh, wow. OK. And if Nicole can go, she'll go, obviously. She goes down there a lot, I think. But we you got to go. It's so I will go. It's just a bunch of like all the people that come to the events are just very nicely dressed, let's say well healed. Let's say it that way. Southern people, have you been to the American South? And no, I've been on to New York. Oh, you've New York and New York only now for two times. You need to go to the American Georgia. So yeah. So let's my mind. Yeah. So let's get into the first topic, the Louis Vuitton cruise show. You were there last week. I don't I have been to I don't take press trips like paid trips, but I have in the past because I've worked to publications where we've taken them. And they're very nice and you get you get to stay in really nice hotels and things. And I've gone on a couple of Louis Vuitton ones. I actually went to Rio when they showed. Oh, I want to mention this then. It was incredible. So tell me about Thursday show. The was it a gaudy? Yeah, it was part of Google. Oh, it wasn't designed by him. And he actually lived there for until he died. But in a building, one of the two buildings that he did not actually design. That's the fun part about that. But now it's kind of a it's owned by the local community. But how to say it's still private park. And I mean, I want to say that after I went to this cruise show, Marathon, last I mean, my first ever cruise show, if we can call it cruise travel show, was when Saint Laurent did in Marrakech in the desert. So that was incredible experience. And then but I was when I was this kid in Georgia, watching everything from home. The LV cruise show was my ultimate goal because the location that Nikola, his team, whoever comes up with this, probably coming from the brief of that Nikola wants best of what exists in the world. Basically, it was especially after seeing the Rio show. I felt like, OK, maybe one day I will be somewhere like this. And after they invited me last year for the first time in Isola Bella show, which they had to switch the location because of the rain, then the climate thing is really real these days because of the outside shows, especially some of them not having plan B. But this time, why it was exciting for me that the weather looked nice and we realized that we would not be under the rain in Barcelona. It was technically my first time in Barcelona for real, because I've been once, but really like for a few hours just to go through car because I went to the other city. And this show felt like the way how I get this, because I'm always mostly with the same group of the people. We are always the same people who travel next to each other. We share this tour. It's called trip. Are you taken care of by the French PR? So I'm yes, I'm French PR, but I'm into this. Let's explain why this matters. So who the PR you're taking care of by means the people that you are with. So when I used to work in business of fashion, I had to be with all the UK people and do the scrum in the back with the UK reporters. And now that I'm American and I did go to the Gucci show, but Puck paid paid for me. But I was with the American. So I got to have lunch at the River Cafe with the Americans and it felt really nice to like be back with my people. This is something that is one of the most fun parts about my job and where with whom who takes care of me and where I sit. Because literally every brand has a different view on me who I am. Total same. From most of the French press, for example, I've seen switch from the digital to the French press. I've seen sticking with me to the digital slash influencers area. And some of them bring into the VIP celebrities area, especially this happened a lot in the US. Yes, we were seated next to each other. Caroline, of course. We were seated at the Oula Johnson show. Yes, you were with the Americans. They put me in VIP area. She's I feel like maybe some of the brands do this because of like I understood some of the brands trick, putting me next to behind opposite side of J. Law or Kylie Jenner is that I'm always getting some something there, which is not traditional. She's wearing this like, for example, when Kylie Jenner is talking to Kelly Rutherford from Gossip Girl and they are talking about something and you catch this moment, it's just fun. And these posts when I just posted that they are sitting next to each other, example, got to a good show. It's one of the most liked posts ever on my account. But I really talk, especially if it's like the weird sitting, a bit unexpected and if like when Jacob L. Ordeez kissing Pierre Paulos Dog in lips, you talk about this. Because everyone wants to be Jacob L. Ordeez at that moment. The dog, I mean, to be that Pierre Paulos dog. So so back to the LV. I was taking care of the French digital slash entertainment department. And we have incredible girls. I love this girl. Do you see her in La Tiquette? Yes. Did you see her? Yes, she looks fabulous. She was wearing and with the other issue, it was her husband also met. Yes, I saw that. I loved them as a couple. They're great. And they're a very chic couple. Takes care of us so much that it's just pleasure to be with her. She always like makes you feel at home at like a school trip. There is no obligation because few of the brands could be a bit obligatory in terms of like, we would like you to be here and there, but it's always chill. And this was the and the thinking what I always have about the reserve shows that I always wanted to say, especially about LV shows. Sometimes I keep was keeping asking myself, like, do I really like the show and collection? Or I was just attracted by the location and everything around it, like the whole whole aura. And this was the LV show where I can say that location did not overshadow the collection. And for me, it was one of the most realistic collections that I can see on people wearing. And and after the show, there were like two people, like it was really 50 50, because some people look like, oh, we want, let's say, more editorial stuff to shoot like nice pictures and have make more fashion statement. Others were like, oh, we can wear this so I can actually see people wearing them like in a daily life, events or somewhere. So such a nice balance to catch it. And these days at the cruise shows from LV and all the craziness coming from the real show and the Kyoto show, especially. And then mixed with the collection and Nicolas sci-fi futuristic visions that in many of the cases, it feels like, oh, how can someone wear this? This felt so real from the start to the end for me that I was really just like sitting and watching the show to see the close. Two two observations from that. I've actually gone to quite a few LV shows for various reasons, resort shows. And I would say I tend to prefer his resort collections. They're really fat. I mean, all of his stuff is like material and fabric driven, but those are, I would say, even more so. And I agree. Like they just they're they're a little more commercial, but but still have his whole big idea and then the venue itself. I went to the Salk Institute one. Yeah. And the Salk Institute was it was insane. Like and the one in Rio almost was like feeling being there, watching from the screen. Yeah. The one in Rio also. So funny because that was the one where the shaman rumors really started. It didn't rain and also there were zero mosquitoes. Dead. This at this point. Yeah, I heard he was dead. But who knows? I tried to I tried to do the reporting. It was too hard. But the other thing about it, I thought that the 10 year anniversary show, I was really I really liked it. The show previous to it, I was like, whatever. I mean, they can get a little bit like what is going on. But the 10 year ready to wear 10 year ready to wear. OK, they're ready to wear the previous ready to wear, which I. Yeah. Yeah. But the 10 year I thought was like really spot on. And and there's I it reminds you of why like he is one of the most important designers of that generation. And it's so influential. You kind of in the in the middle of his time at LV, you sort of forgot about that. And then it like popped back for me at that 10. And then he does like the mix of this like very Spanish hats mixed with super cool sunglasses. And you were like, OK, this it was very it was referential to Spain and Barcelona. But in a very updated, very modern way, because I can see like even for the events like this way of styling of the heads. But the hair so beautiful and the draping no one does draping. He's one of the masters because the Mona to guard look that she wore like towards like the end like last 10 looks. It could be like separate collection like of dresses that can be worn from, let's say, from evening to the day we are. So I was really into that in an overall way. And location was still incredible with the views, but it did not eat. Yes, understood. Yeah. This show is brought to you by Boca. Boca knows that when you take care of your mouth, your whole body benefits. That's why they create elevated oral care that fortifies your teeth. Boca's toothpaste uses a fluoride alternative called nano hydroxyapatite or Enha.

Make the switch to Boca for the whole family at Boca.com. So moving on from Barcelona to Cannes to the south of France. Yes. OK, let's do this quick because we talked a lot about Nikola and LB. It's 10 years anniversary. So 10 year anniversary. I also had a huge presence at the Cannes Film Festival as well. I wrote a bit last week about fashion, sort of infiltrating the festival with Saint Laurent had three, three of the movies and then also won a bunch of awards. Their movies won a bunch of awards. So it's really interesting. But I want to hear from you. Who were your best dressed? So whoever you think best or worst dressed when you think of Cannes this year, it's Bella Hadid from start to the end. It was the most anticipated, like unexpected start to see undercarpet, but on the streets. And I feel like this time street fashion in Cannes was especially very interesting. And I heard time, a few times that especially like few of the Cannes street dressings, like it means like the room or I don't have a confirmation. We're really like well, how to say, confirmed in advance with the brands and there was like to say who, what she would wear was really, really considered from the red and what she would look, she would walk out just to get like something for even for like 15, 20 minutes. So I did a bit of, you know, like my attraction to the number. So out of 10 looks that she wore, I mean, basically, I liked most of them some more, some less, but she had three Versace vintage dresses out of this. And basically only two of them were new. They were just around like the current, like the last collection and Jacques Mouss upcoming collection for which I got few DMs like saying like, what's the point? But then the point is that this show of Jacques Mouss, where I'm going in 10 days to Capri, this is the collection where Bella wore the dress and this is kind of a see now buy now collection. So this will be in the stores and on the website a few days after it will be shown. So there is no six months waiting time. And I think I felt it looked cool. It looked good on her and it's smart decision in terms of because it's really coming in, even I'm as like someone who always expects like highlight casting at the shows, I am thinking maybe we can see Bella walking at Jacques Mouss. I mean, why not? She was one of the girls who was who could I mean, I would be very expected. I liked one of the looks that I can remember totally was the East Olds Dior's like new look with the new look to bring this look and make it like such a off the moment looking. And I was really, I don't want to say surprised, but so I love Saldana, Saldana, I mean, I love Saldana in general. And I feel like Saldana really looks good on many people. Many people. I agree. Even when many other brands don't look the same good to the people. But I feel like Zoy Saldana's looks. I feel like she wore six to seven, all of them YSL and it looked like all of them really looked good. And I remember this like Princess moment of Anya Taylor Joy in a sparkling Dior dress, which was from 1957, Dear Kuture Collection, coming from like referential. But one of the highlights from the day one was Naomi working with Low Roach. But low. Really, I felt that they only had like four or five looks, but this Chanel moment to recreate this after Naomi Chanel, wearing the Chanel dress she walked in the runway in 1997 was she looked better now, say, wow, like, I mean, Naomi's in. I don't know offense to Low Roach. I don't need to see him on the red carpet either. But you would never say anything negative. I could say it. I don't, I don't know why he needs to pose with her. He looked great, but like I don't. But she looked amazing. And I forgave it in that moment because because she looked so good. And Hunter's Armani dress was really, really. She looked amazing the whole time. The Armani and also Prada look. I think Dara is doing incredible job with her. Incredible. Dara looks also super cool with all the outfits. Yes. And I think they really make a nice, nice, like, collaborative couple. But men, the main question I was discussing from the end, I started actually thinking from Met Gala about guns was that where are the new brands? Where are the new clothes? Where are the new collections? So I feel like this amount of vintage that we are seeing right now on the carpet. And that was my main question when I made like some of post about the Met Gala and Bella's choices of the look shown that like this incredible treasure of the archives. Where are the new people's all this like star designers of the moment, winners of all the prizes? Like what? Where are their looks? Here is the big reason this happens. Because it's really first of all, there isn't enough stuff. And and especially it can these celebrities want to get paid. So if if a couture house doesn't have enough, they'll do custom. But I think they'll do vintage or vintage custom or whatever. A lot of it has to do with there's there was just not enough left from from there was such an influx over the last year because of the strike. And then everybody bouncing back and everybody's just doing so many red carpet and daytime appearances. So I think the vintage thing is part of that. But then I also think it's really hard to fit a piece of clothing on a person, especially a person who is not super, super, super, super thin. So like someone like a Greta Lee can wear a sample. Not everyone, even there are really thin people with boobs or like broad shoulders or whatever, and that makes it really hard. And I think it's also a bit of a trend. But I do think a big part of it is the fact that it is that there is just it is hard to get something to fit. And so if you want to get paid and you want it to fit, you want to work with one of these big houses who has the internal team. You're talking about Saint Laurent. If you look at Greta Gerwig, who had like a very controversial, I would say red carpet for can like her. Manny looked amazing. The Saint Laurent looked amazing. A couple, not every Celine looked good, but a lot of the Celine stuff she wore looked good. The Margiela was really controversial because it was like milk made. Margiela Kuchur collection doesn't work hard. It doesn't. It looked good on her in the room with the lighting and then the bright lighting. It's it doesn't it's not it's it's not for real life. But but I think that that's a big part of it. And it and I think just the proliferation and there are just so many looks that like the vintage thing, there is a sort of throwback. People want to look just really glamorous. And so the Balenciaga or whatever, all those those like vintage references. But then I do think a big thing is there's just there's so much and you want it to fit. So you're going to go with a house that knows how to do that and that can help. I mean, all these people have stylists who have tailors, but like it it's just makes it easier if the brand can can whip it up. I can add one more thing that is coming from Met Gala. And I'm sure if I was one in Cannes, I would get them similar replies that that I had a chance to talk with a few celebrities at the red carpet after the red carpet. And why about their preparations? They are telling me that it's getting so stressful to find something really unique. Yeah. And it's getting so because the attention is becoming so big. They are not having fun anymore, finding these looks and just making like how, what will others wear, how we can top like it's everything just becoming like who can wear better and better and better. But there is like there should be some like breathing moment, there is nothing left of these people to just give in a moment and just really wear what you really want. And one thing that disappointed I was because I'm a guy, so I want to see nice dressed men, but it comes in Cannes. I did not see anyone. Yeah, no one literally anyone because last year I remember this San Loren moment, you remember all these guys, like the group pictures of San Loren guys because they had also the movie last year from Manly Os to the other other young and like different the mix of the generations wearing all San Loren, this like transparent chiffon tops and the suites and it looked so good. But this year I literally don't remember any male actor. The only person I remember is Richard Gear. I think you're just wearing Armani. Yeah, you look great. But yeah, I agree. So interestingly, the one thing I would like to say about male dressing is one thing I did this weekend was I watched this show on Netflix. It's probably not even available on Netflix in France, but it's called Everybody's in LA. It was the six six part live talk show with the comedian John Mulaney. Do you know who this guy is? Everybody's in LA. Yeah. So it's really funny. Everybody was all of my friends are teasing me because I was like, should I watch this guy stand up? Who watches stand up? I don't watch stand up. But what I will say is this it's like a variety. It was live and and now and we're just watching it in retro. But this guy's stylist. So he's a pretty famous comedian in America and have this big scandal during covid. It's whatever who cares. But apparently he's very funny. The show is really good. But this guy's stylist stylist, this guy's stylist, Michael Fisher. He styles. He did Sebastian Stan at Cannes who looked really good. His hair is too long, but he looked good. He styles the white lotus guy, Jake Lacey, who's like very annoyingly into fashion, like really loves he's like a denim head. He styles Corey Stoll, who was in House of Cards. He does Jake Gyllenhaal. Apparently he styles John Mulaney. John Mulaney's clothes on the show are so good. He's wearing like Breone and the row and he just looks fabulous. The entire time Jerry Seinfeld was a guest. I don't think he styled Jerry Seinfeld, but Jerry Seinfeld also looked really, really good. But anyway, this guy is like this Michael Fisher. Everyone who's into menswear who's listening to this is like, yeah, of course we know this guy. I had not heard of him. I think I would say he's like the best to me. Hands down the best men stylist working. He works with like tons of different bodies. Nobody looks like a freak. They all look good. They look snazzy. Like they, Calvin Harrison, Jr. wearing long band, like looks fabulous. Like he dressed Paul Giamatti. He can do anyone. I'm really into this Michael Fisher. Maybe you can come on the podcast. But I would say if you want some male inspiration, this might be a little too American for you, Becca. But I think like he, Sebastian Stan, what is he wearing? He wore this like, what is he wearing this time? He wore Givenchy and a Mary and he and like a richer poor, which is an American t-shirt brand. He looks fabulous. The t-shirt's a little wrinkled, but generally Sebastian Stan looked good and he's wearing this like, oh, Balenciaga suit is so fabulous. He looks great. Big fan of Michael Fisher. I would say you need to check it out. Yeah. Watch this show. It's extremely funny. And since you haven't been to LA, it really gives you a sense. So essentially for people. Yeah, it's essentially for people who used to live in New York and live in LA now and and all the like funny things that you observe. But it's really good anyway. We have one more topic before the rumor of the week, but I'm just curious. It I, as I said in my newsletter, these things always happen in threes. So last last weekend, a week ago, Mara Hoffman, the American designer, she says she's closing, at least pausing. Two days later, Susie Cave, vampire's wife, she's like, I'm out. I don't want to deal with this anymore. And then a couple of days after that, Dion Lee filed for, which is like administration in Australia because their investor in Australia pulled out. I, as I said, I don't think that Dion Lee is going to go out of business. That essentially means they filed for chapter 11, which bankruptcy which means you get to like clear all your debt if you get a new investor. Dion Lee from everything I know has a pretty strong business in terms of growth. So I think that that he'll be able to keep going. I'm just curious from your perspective, from your perch in France, where there aren't as many independent brands, but and yet there is the biggest independent brand, Jack-O-Mouse, I'm just curious what you think is going on with all these companies. Is it just the fallout from matches? What do you see as someone who's also worked with a lot of independent brands in your former life? I have a few things to say about this subject from different perspectives, honestly, and this is one of the topics that where every fashion dinner conversation really starts and ends these days and matches is one of the biggest like starting point to talk and then we always go deeper. So me as working to guy as to the independent brands like this medium price level affordable luxury, as we call kind of almost good quality, perfect close brands, I feel like main problem, except despite considering all the situation of people stop buying or what's going on in the economical side around the world, I feel like the main issue, one of the most of them, and it was the case of the few of the brands that I had personally relationship was that becoming too big, too fast and losing the sense of where you started from losing the base community, touch with them and just making everything going to. I don't want to say like commercial, but just bigger that ends up big, that makes you ends up being no one at the end because yeah. And I think department stores have their huge role in this because even I was attracted like 2016 and 17. Can you imagine getting orders from all the Harvon, Nikols and Browns and all the big retailers for the brand that only were presented in three stores and suddenly they give you all this is our minimum. We don't pay anything in advance with the few exceptions. For example, Browns at the beginning was always ready to pay in advance because to allow us to produce and you take use every single resource and just to be represented in some stores thinking that, oh, I need it for the brand image. But then you are losing your most loyal, the small boutique who found you first, who always been consistent with you, who are always supportive with you. Even if you ask like, oh, can you please transfer at least half? Because they're also family run businesses. They understand they've been in the situations like you, but from the other other side. And I feel like today most of the brands not even realizing that if the problem was that, oh, let's make this thousand minimum pieces of like each collection and to be represented there and get then 70 or 60 percent back on a consignment and then wait for the payment for six months and end up with nothing while losing and delivering super late with the your loyal customers. And a few weeks ago, I was in Rome. I met now my friends, the brand founders of the Juliva brand that I posted last week about them, and they are like, I can say that they are my crush in a way. As my friend says, in terms of aesthetic, because when I look first, I look how they look, how they are made and what is their visual and what is their message. And if we skip this because I made like two series of posts talking about them, one of the things that I could can speak coming from them is that that's the case with them because end of the day, they realize that being on every few big retailers brought nothing to them. And those small boutiques in every country who found them are the ones who keep reordering, having the customer base returning customers, having multiple pieces of the brand because but they realize it in a very right moment because they are one of the smartest people, not in terms of what they do in terms of visual and aesthetic design, even if it's coming from hard but expressing in a good way. But the way I feel like the way how they decided now to keep their business connected to the authentic base where they started, I think if most of the brands, even the ones that I worked in Georgia would go back, this can not survive but bring you to like keep on some level and stop losing and not to make every size of every minimum of every big store because you go to the store and your clothes are just hanging and no one cares about you. They are not storytelling anything about you. While this small boutique has 15 brands and the founder is the woman or guy who really likes and he speaks to the customer and sells to them in a authentic, like different way. So I think going faster, making trying to become too big too soon, it's the main problem from all the areas. Yeah, I would agree. I would say that sticking with it's it's it's all very hard. And the thing is, if you go into these big retailers, I said this to a friend of mine who was in matches and lost a good amount of money there. I said, look, like this is going to happen every five years and maybe even every three years, like the last time it really happened was Barney's and for some people opening ceremony, but it's going to happen. This is this and also retailers have been going bankrupt since the 90s, like multi brand retail is a screwed up business and it's important to be in it. But you have to be prepared and you know, my friend was is very prepared. So it's going to be OK. But like the other big thing I'd say, you mentioned these independent boutiques and it's hard because sometimes those boutiques have a bad season and they're late on payments and stuff. And I remember I was talking to Nancy Pearl, seen who owns relish in Washington, D.C. or in Georgetown. And she was a big Dries person. She carries Dries and she mentioned to me, you know, they were really patient with her when she first started the business. And and so I think that Dries is her first or second best selling brand that she sells now in Georgetown and Washington, D.C. sells Dries, Van Noten. So there is a thing about if you can maintain those relationships because those are the stores that have the high sell through rate and some some seasons they don't do well and some of those store owners are totally insane and never pay and that's bad too. But it's just a hard bit. It's a hard business. And I would say for these three brands that are struggling right now that we're in the news or closed or whatever, like sometimes it's OK to have a pause. Like Maura said, not everyone is a fashion show also. No, 200. Yeah. Yeah. And and we're not saying like it's really hard to make money off of this business. It's basically impossible. But if you want to do it, it's OK to take a break. It's OK to just stop like with with Susie Cave. I'm sure she could have gotten more money for the vampire's wife. It's she has a great product that women love and also she's cool and people want to be around her. So of course, she could have raised another two million dollars to stay in it for a little bit longer, but sometimes it's like OK to just stop. We'll be right back.

I'm back with Becca from style.com. We're going to do the rumor of the week. I know you don't deal in rumors, so I'm going to lay out what's going on. It's about all these coming and goings at LVMH. So they're and Ken was wiping Instagram and yeah, Kim, Kim wiping the Instagram. So there's a lot of a lot happening within the executive ranks at LVMH. It seems that Michael Burke is no longer going to be the CEO of the fashion group. And it seems that his deputy is is going to Fendi to be the CEO. And then the Fendi CEO surge might go and be the CEO of the fashion group. And then Sidney Toledano is back helping out. Delphine Arnaud is around helping out negotiating contracts. Meanwhile, on the designer side, there's no designer for Givenchy. Michael Ryder to Celine, I know for sure. But when we don't know, Hedy is still working. He was still working a couple of weeks ago shooting campaigns and such. So like we don't know when maybe that's not till November. Who knows. And then there's also this this Kim Jones factor. And so Kim Jones has is at Fendi designing women's. He's at Dior designing men's. What is that? Could your show off? They just cancel the Couture show off Fendi. They also canceled the men's China show for for Dior men. So I really get any travel show after the Egypt one, I guess. Interesting. So so here is the question for me. Where what do you want to see happen? Let's not talk about what whether or not these people where is Kim Jones going or is he is he going anywhere? Is he going to be there for 20 years? If you this is fantasy football now, if you could decide who is going to be a Givenchy, who is going to be at Celine, who is going to be at Dior, who is going to be at Fendi, tell me some of your dream scenario. Nothing. This is not based on any intel. This is based on your own just like your own gut or Givenchy. I mean, you have this line going on about Givenchy and mentioning basically everyone from there, but you know me. And I think at some point we share similar taste in several areas. And for me, Givenchy kind of a brand is very Stefano Pilati kind of a designer. But I mean, it's my like how to say to play in a way that what I have, my earliest fashion memories of the first designers that I was introduced as fashion and Stefano was one of the first. And I don't I'm really 50 50 about John Galliano going back to Givenchy, honestly, because it requires I don't know. There are moments when I'm like, oh, yes, why not? Let's go back to this like and it made me to research more and to see their archives there. But about Fendi, I would say that because of they want to really have a big hundred years, I'm sure, because it's Fendi and it could be really start of something bigger after the hundred years is are you done? And I don't know if it's a thing that kind of family is waiting to celebrate the 100th anniversary, which I would do as I was a family member, honestly. And I would not exit when I'm 99 years old. House, let's say I want to celebrate 100 years and then live with the like big exit if it's planned at all. But I feel like when Kim Jones does what he does at Dior Men's, it really works because I mean, you can see last I mean, but I was really into Kim's the starting collections of Dior Men's when he started. Yeah. First few. Then it was not really I was not really into. But last two collections have been really great in terms of and you see this introduction of the couture and everything was really, really good. And when you see the pieces, they are incredibly made. But the sense of, I don't know, like him feeling that this is kind of all the shifting and him cleaning and everything, making him ready for Givenchy in a way. Like, yeah, I the sense it's not a wish. It's a sense. I heard last winter that he was going to Givenchy. So but who knows also these people change their minds all the time. The thing that we have to remember is the only person, the only people that really know is the designer and Bernard Arnault and maybe one or two other people like it or even not them because I mean, I feel like there could be like, I'm sure there are last minute changes happening. I've heard that always from the past, like, yes, people going to the taxi to sign the contract and getting a call that we decided for someone else. So you have like, don't totally like when Hedy Hedy went to Celine the night before I had dinner with someone who was connected to you. Dior and was like, oh, he's going, he's going to Dior. And then the next day I was like, silly. So who who the heck knows? I think the Michael Ryder thing is definitely true. But my dream would be Hedy at Dior. OK, I only want Galliano Givenchy because it's a good story. It's like, oh, it's such a I mean, it would be 50 percent of the story. Oh, yeah, it's just a great one. But for me, Eddie is like just in my sometimes I feel like he's my number one. Oh, he's he's great. If he's not in my tonight, he's definitely in top three. But like number one in top three that never changes since forever. And I feel where Eddie, if the signs of him giving us with the last two shows, he always exists with the most elegant collection from every brand. And if you remember when he exited Saluran and did the couture, not ready to wear show, the most elegant show that I still rewatch very often just to feel Kim and what he did with the last men's and women's shows of Celine and having no pants, shorts and everything just being a dress, dress, dress, dress and super elegance, like ultimate chic. And the last man's show when he's just burning this the music player at the end. It just like sound like bye. But Kim, Dior or Chanel, both I'm OK with both. Yeah. Yeah. I I think Kim, everyone's always a audition. But Chanel is working well, so we are not seeing him there. Yeah, I mean, we could debate about whether it is it's working. Is it well? Is another question. Numbers. Yeah, totally. I mean, I'm not I'm not a hater. I just it would be fun for something else to happen someday. What who else? So we did G-match. I mean, Fendi, I just wanted to be someone fun. And I do wish it had been Alessandro. I think it could have been great. But like let's just make it fun. Let's make it wacky. I'm I'm on board. And it's whatever happens to all these people. We wish them all the best. You're all very talented and it's going to be great. Do you have anything about Lan Van? Because, you know, we are into this brand somehow. No, I actually don't. All I my my hunch is that it's a woman. OK, or or I don't know why. But I think someone actually asked me if Michael Rider could be going there. And I was like, I just don't think so. Oh, and then the other. But I think it'll be I hope that they announce that soon. Because that is an amazing brand. I wish it had been Stefano Pilotti, but it's not. Of course. And about this, you remember when? Yes. Yeah. I mean, Stefano Pilotti, let's just get this man a job because I love him so much. And he needs to he needs to be somewhere full time. He's so good. Absolutely. Oh, man. OK, Becca, this we got to go. This was so fun. But maybe we can do this during couture or something. I'll do because are you coming for men's or couture? I'm coming for a little bit. I'm only I'm going to like two shows, but I'll be around. So maybe we can do it that week or something. Yes. And because this is going to be the Paris messiest week. I know. History. I know. Normal. Don't tell don't tell fashion tourists. Don't tell my partner Liz goff that because she's coming with me. Let's be real. Don't take car. That's the main. I never take cars. I walk everywhere. I mean, I'll be great. Take a game. Yeah. Can't wait to see you. We'll at least have a drink in Paris. OK. Thank you. Thank you so much. This was so fun.
