Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Puck's fashion and beauty memo line sheet. And today with me on the show we have none other than the Wall Street Journal's Jacob Gallagher. We're going to talk best and worst dressed at the French Open, the Gap Renaissance. And we're going to ask a very serious question. What length should your shorts be this summer? We'll have that and much more. Plus the rumor of the week. Let's get started. Hey everyone, I hope you are well. Happy Tuesday. We have a really packed show today, Jacob, and I just had a lot to discuss and want to get right to that. But I wanted to give you a heads up on a few things that were in Monday's line sheet. Outdoor Voices got sold to a new owner consortium brands, which you probably haven't heard of, but I have a bunch of details on that. My big takeaway is, we'll see. I don't know. Do people care about this brand enough at this point? I'm not sure, but good on them for trying and I wish them the best of luck. There is also an analysis of what's going on at Gap right now and Jacob and I get into that too. I hope you enjoyed that. One thing I wanted to tell you about was this situation I experienced last Thursday. I think it just says a lot. If you're a fashion person and you work in the industry, about the bubble that we live in. I live in Los Angeles. I dress very casually day to day. I wear vintage jeans and vintage sweatshirts on those days. When I go into the office, I dress up a little bit more. I wear jeans and blazers and a very small heel, that type of thing. On Thursday, I was going to this Japanese wrestling thing, Tsukaban or Tsukaban or whatever you call it, downtown. It's very fashion heavy. So, Olivia Litan is one of the owners and she's a creative director. She does the costumes. Katie Gran was here. She did a shoot and she was in town to see it. She runs with all of them and has styled some of their photo shoots and things. The makeup is amazing. It's very, very fashion heavy. I knew there would be a lot of fashion industry people there. Carol and Ambrito from an opening ceremony were there. I just wanted to kind of dress like the way I would in New York. So, I wore a Uniqlo unit, my leather pants, my leather jeans from Proenza that are very casual, a very small almond toe heel from the row. Then, I wore this Prada overcoat that's plaid. It would be all black, very simple. Something I would wear in New York or London or Paris or whatever. I actually wore this same outfit on Tuesday to have dinner at the Sunset Tower. So, totally normal. I go to my kid's art show at his preschool in Northeast Los Angeles on Thursday. And I'm in this outfit because we're going to go out for dinner and then I'm going to go to this Japanese wrestling thing. This is like 430. I get there. I looked completely insane. Literally, there was not one person that didn't have on jeans and that didn't have on sneakers. No one was dressed up and I guess it was at 430. So, the people who have office jobs who couldn't get out of it weren't there. But it just made me remember that we do not live in normal society. And in normal society, there is an event at your kid's school and everybody's in like torn up jeans and sneakers. And nobody is dressed up in any way at all. And so, it just reminded me and that's why I like living here because it reminds me that the world that I lived in for so long and that we all occupy is not representative of the larger world. So, it's just some food for thought for you before we get into this. They all looked great. I'm not judging it. It's just funny. I was saying when my husband and I were leaving, we actually ran into my friend Amanda and her family. They were driving by us and she said, oh, you're wearing the leather pants. They look great. And I was like, oh, I was so overdressed. I said to my husband, I was like, if I wasn't going to the sink, I would still sort of dress up for this. And the reality is people don't dress up. So, that is my lesson for you. I hope if you have any feedback on it, send it to me. I love these voicemails you're sending me. I love these notes. DM me on Instagram. Send me an email. I'm happy to receive it. But let's get going with Jacob because there's a lot to say. Jacob, how's it going? It's going well. How are you doing, Lauren? Good. How was your weekend? It was nice. I watched a lot of tennis and I played some tennis. It was great. How is the French open going? It's actually going quite well. Well, I should say it's going well from afar. Everyone that I know that is there is complaining because it has been incredibly rainy and cold in Paris, which derailed much of the schedule. But as we're speaking, most of the top seeds are still in it. So, it's been fun to watch. Okay. So, my puck partner, Dylan Byers, messaged me on Friday and he said, I need your best dressed from Roland Garros. And I was like, these people all look fine. I couldn't actually pick a best dressed. I'm curious to know, now we've had two more days, two and a half more days of playing. Who is a good, well-dressed tennis? I thought they all looked decent. You were saying when we were talking earlier that you thought they all looked like crap. Who's the best dressed at Roland Garros this year? I was being hyperbolic, but it is funny because I feel like this discussion is, it can't go unsaid that every tennis fan thinks that the era that they're in has the worst kits and that the kits from like 20 years ago were better and 20 years before that were even better. But I do think right now, I like the new balance kits. Unfortunately, Tommy Paul is out of the tournament now, but he looks quite good. I like the color schemes. I like that it's just kind of like a classic polo and it fits him well, which is like a big problem that the men's players have in particular, which is that their clothes are really tight. There's a whole thing on the men's side where like all of the collars are kind of messed with in a way that I mean, I'm not a Nike designer, so I don't know exactly what kind of brief they're getting, but like all of the Nike shirts this season kind of look like they're a weird like nurses scrub collar going on. I don't understand where this came from. On the women's side, I think Irina Sabalanca looks interesting in Nike, though this like kind of swirling color scheme is like psychedelic, but like kid picks kind of thrown in there. I don't exactly get the pattern on it, but and Adidas had everyone in like this weird yellow and black B color scheme that it was like, it could have been a B movie promo tie-in. Oh yeah, I don't know why they did that. It was really weird and has nothing to do with the French like those colors. I didn't quite get where that was coming from, but yeah, I like it. And I think I'm trying to think of who else is in new balance. Oh yeah, Coco Gough is in new balance too. I think she's my number one pick. She has actual style, which you can see it in the way like her, the way she accessorizes it. I thought when I looked through the slideshow that Dylan sent me, I was like, this girl is in the sort of most boring outfit, but also looks the coolest out of all of them. Yeah. And I like that it was broken up between the skirt and the top. I think sometimes the dress can look kind of weird and not, I guess infantilizing almost on certain players, but it works. It looks cool. You know, the on running or the, I always say on running, the on kits are what, you know, gets the most attention at these tournaments now it seems because they keep doing these kind of like swirly color schemes. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. Like it looks okay on Igor Svjantek. It looked quite good on this up and coming men's player, Cabello. I don't think it looks as good on Ben Shelton. I don't really know why that is. It's just like he's already so emotional that it is so intense that I think the color scheme the color scheme is doing too much maybe, but on is using the platform very well. They're getting a lot of attention from these uniforms as they're, or these kits as they're trying to surge into tennis and make a big show in tennis. And I think they're succeeding. Obviously it's helpful that they're dressing the world number one who is on the war path to winning again. But yeah. Yeah. I thought, I mean, I'm not watching it. I thought Ben Shelton looked decent in the photos. And also I thought he looked good. He was in the Loewe campaign, right? So the thing I will say about on, which by again, like, I don't know if I mentioned this before, really hard to Google that. So hard. When you're thinking about naming something, think about what you're naming it. And on running is actually easier, but they obviously don't want that. But so I've been looking real, I actually just bought a pair of their shorts and a sports bra because there is no good active wear for women, which I believe we have discussed in the past. But I also looked at the Loewe stuff and bought, I did buy a pair of the shorts, but I might return them because they didn't have the shirt that I wanted. But the point being, I thought that that stuff looked really good. And I am suddenly looking at the Loewe stuff made me look at the on classic collection. And suddenly I'm like, okay, maybe this actually is my alternative to OV 10 years ago that I've never been able to replace or what have you. But it is, it's interesting. And after challengers, obviously they had a big presence there. It does feel like they are really making moves. Was anyone wearing Uniqlo? There's one player left on the tour who actually, he was making a comeback. He's a Japanese player who's been sponsored by them for a very long time. Kay Nishikori and he, he flamed out. But he always looked great in Uniqlo. I think he actually was sponsored by them before Federer was. And he, you know, the kids have always been good. I've always kind of liked it, but he didn't last very long. It does not seem like Uniqlo is signing anyone young as far as I'm, as far as I can tell. But they, you know, the Uniqlo, I will say this, the Uniqlo, J.W. Anderson, Tennis Shorts from a year ago are the shorts that I play. Tennis in, they're the only shorts I play in. They're fantastic. They're a great white short, perfect weight, great cut. They, you know, Uniqlo makes good active wear in my opinion. But they are not that much of a presence at the French right now. Got it. So that's interesting. I was going to ask you what you wear for, for playing. Bad t-shirt and those shorts. Perfect. So Uniqlo, the thing that Mr. Unai has always wanted for Uniqlo is it for it to overtake the gap and be, so it's interesting there in, in all the sport stuff, but he's always wanted it to be the next gap. And the interesting thing that's happening right now is that the gap is having a bit of a revitalization. The gap ink, the parent company, which owns Gap, Old Navy Banana Republic, and Athleta, really a huge potential at Athleta, I think. But the point being that that business, for the first quarter in like, I don't even know how long, they had positive comps in all four brands. So comps are sales for stores open at least one year. So you can always like increase your sales by opening a bunch of stores. But if your sales at stores that have been open for a year increase, that is a better indicator of financial health. And so they had four, and I read the earnings transcript and five analysts congratulated them. Four said, good luck. Like people are like, gap is back. And so the thing is, all those four brands are all very complicated. They're all stories in and of themselves. But the gap brand specifically is in this very interesting place where it's having all these marketing things happen. Zach Pozen is the creative director of the whole company. He designed this white shirt dresser, Anne Hathaway, that like they pre, they sold very, a very limited quantity at pre-order and it sold out. Then he did this divine joy, Randolph dress at the Met Gala, which we talked about. And then also there was this Doen by Gap collaboration. So, and then they had this campaign that the CEO of Gap Inc. Richard Dixon mentioned called linen moves with Tyler that apparently has performed really well. So that's all the stuff that's happening in marketing. At the same time, I'm hearing from people that are like, I just am liking Gap again. They have a cute score. They have great sweats, all of these things. I don't think that the marketing and the product are matching up in any way, but I'm curious for your take on what you think about this very early gap revitalization. The thing is, you have to remember this stuff it's okay to have a good quarter. Let's see what happens long term, but I'm curious to know what you think about it. If you're looking at Gap from a consumer perspective or even when you're working on stories where you need to pull in product, that's not crazy expensive. Okay. So I was trying to think about this from the capacity of what Gap, what a mall brand needs to do right now because we're talking about Gap in a week, where in a month and a year, where Abercrombie is the stock everyone's talking about. This is the biggest retail stock on earth. This is one of the biggest stocks on earth right now. But what Abercrombie has done is a total flip. It's not the Gap model. The Gap model was commodity, basic staples, good products, what have you. Abercrombie is more vibe, more look. You look at that website and it's pretty directional, let's say, in what a lot of the product is. I don't want to say trend focus, but it's certainly trend conscious. It's almost like an ASOS model. Fast fashion. It's fast fashion. It's fast fashion now. Yeah. And this climate though, it's like the Gap model where you and I might hear from people that are like, hey, good skirt, good t-shirt, good what have you. I mean, for a long time, Gap was known for like underwear in a certain way to a certain client. That's a product commodity business. And so, and even the shirt dress that they did for Ann Hathaway, that's interesting, but it's not that intriguing. It doesn't have that much going on. No. It's not like a piece you'd necessarily see on someone barring Ann Hathaway and be like, whoa, that's really got a lot going on. It's the most interesting thing in the room, let's say. So I don't know if this is like the right approach for this time necessarily. That's my feeling where I just look at, again, what Abercrombie has found success doing or what like, you know, let's say Madewell Men's has found success doing. And it's this, again, I think it needs to be that much more doing something than what Gap is seemingly aiming their ship towards. Because when you play the great T-shirt, great pair of Lynn and Pants game, you're competing against just so many people at this point. Everyone has their own opinion about that. It's hard to break through. Okay. I agree with you, but this is my, I'm going to give you my whole thing. So if I was a business, if I was an analyst at one of these BMO, my buddy Simeon, I would be like, they just need to do what Abercrombie did. Abercrombie tried to lean into its heritage and we love all the Bruce Weber stuff and have chic stuff that looks like Margaret Howell, but cheap or whatever. That didn't work because that's too niche. They just went, we're just going to be fast fashion and do TikTok and make jeans that make girls look hot, whatever. Congrats to Fran Horowitz. I'm obsessed with it. Good for her. And also though everybody likes the jeans they fit well. If I was an analyst, I would go to Richard Dixon and be like, you need to just do that. It's never going to work. This like linen moves bullshit. Okay. My thing that I feel that's happening though, there is nowhere you can buy premium basics. You can buy Amazon. You can buy, I'm wearing like a $9 Hain sweatshirt. I buy a ton of vintage. Like you and I are not the customer for sure. And we know that, but there is all of this product is crap. So when you actually feel it and touch it, you don't want it. You want to go to, you're just like, I'm just going to go on Amazon and buy it. Why should I go to even Gap to buy something? And I think what they should do is sell Banana Republic because Banana Republic will never, yeah, they had a quarter of good comps. They fired the CEO and they got rid of the stupid. They had a write down on all the stupid furniture they made. Nope. Banana Republic never really worked. Even in the 90s with the metrosexual stuff, it was never the, it was never Mickey Drexler's focus. Like it was just, it has never actually worked. They need to sell Banana Republic, let some licensing firm deal with it and they should make Gap a little more premium. And I think we're returning, my instinct is there's going to be a return to people wanting to be told what to wear because right now, TikTok is telling them what to wear and it's so individualized. And I think it's just going to start making people crazy. And I do think there is a place where you get, when I was in high school, I used to buy a gray, a white black t-shirt and green cargo pants from Gap. And that is what I would wear. And I know that this is a different time or whatever. I'm almost 42 years old. I'm I don't understand young people, blah, blah, blah. I know there is a need for that. And so I think, if I were them, I think they're actually doing a lot of this product, but the marketing does not align with the product they're making. And so that's what I would do. But if I was an analyst, I would just be like, just do what Abercrombie did because that's going to work. And that's what really matters here. So, but Richard Dixon seems to really care about brand and preserving the brand. He really has done everything he said he's going to do. I'm very impressed with him so far. I still don't think Zach Posin is the right person to be like the head of creative there. I think he's also done a pretty good job, but it's just, it's not the right fit generally. But short term, I think it's working. But I think if you want to preserve someone who used to work at Abercrombie messaged me and said, this is working right now, but like stripping something of its brand value, that's essentially a licensing firm and it can work short term, but long term it doesn't. And it just depends on what you care about. Do you care about the short term and the long term? But I think you're the point you're making about the quantity stuff. It's true. And I just think like, there's nowhere. There's nowhere that you go for your go to t-shirts. If you want, like Everlane was like that for 10 minutes. Not really, they do fine, but it never became what it, Uniqlo I'd say is probably the closest thing, but their marketing has never managed to communicate what they do. Like the marketing is so misaligned with what like the only reason we all wear Uniqlo is because word of mouth. Yeah. And they currently have the worst, I saw people, I saw this going around people notice this, I've noticed this too. They have the worst website right now. I don't understand this website. I went on there trying to find, I think t-shirts actually, because I wear the same t-shirt from Uniqlo. I've worn it for a few years and I went on there and was like, there are no, it's like, it's like when they try to try to make stuff, like make technology that has no buttons and it's like that, but a website and I'm like, what am I supposed to click on? I don't know, sorry, this is a total tangent, but this website is crazy. It is so bad. I had the same experience when I was trying to buy like new Uniqlo U-stuff. I couldn't even find it. Yeah. And it was a weird thing where you couldn't like you had to search on Google to get to the page because the navigation is all screwed up. Yeah. I mean, I've had experiences where I've bought stuff from the website and had it dropped in a store and then I get there and it's still not in the store. And I'm like, well, you have it, have the product here. Can I just take it? And they're like, no, it's two different businesses. You'd have to rebuy it and return the stuff. It's just, it's completely idiotic. It's very Japanese. It is. Like they, they never figured that part out. It's, look, like, got a hand it to them. He never gave up and he really has, they've done pretty well in the U.S. after like 10 misfires. But I still think the marketing is terrible. Like you go into the store and the store is cool, but like there's the person on the overcome that sounds like a robot. It's just like, it's, it's hard to expand. It's hard to leave the U.S. market if you're a U.S. brand and it's hard to enter the U.S. market if you're an international brand. This show is brought to you by Boca.

I want to go back to something you said though, because I think that this is important to talk about like how these brands function in this current moment, which is you said kind of TikTok being a little too individualized. I think actually it's interesting because my interpretation of TikTok and how it works trend wise is that everyone has now just become this cloned pack. You know, maybe I'm thinking too men's focused, but like on menswear, what has made Abercrombie thrive is this whole like, you know, this is the pant and it's from Abercrombie and this is the open collar shirt and it's from Abercrombie and this is like, you know, this like little braided belt and it's written like that. Every guy, like if you look through their tagged photos, it's like a million little guys on Reels that have 100 to 10,000 followers and they are all dropping the same outfit over and over again. And that has, I think that that made their, really made their business soar because those products, they look nice on a screen. That is what they are really good at. When you're on Instagram, you're scrolling through the nip polo, it looks nice. Who cares about how it feels? It looks nice in the photo. I don't know how it feels. I've never gone to the store and felt it. It might feel great, but it certainly looks good on the screen and that particularly again, through thinking about menswear, that has made their business really thrive because that's how people shop these days. Will it look cool on me when I take a FitPick? That's the customer they've zeroed in on and that's where gap is lacking. That t-shirt might feel incredible. That skirt might fit you perfectly. If it's not going to stop someone on their phone, I don't know how they're going to break through. Otherwise, you're just relying on word of mouth that, hey, this t-shirt feels great and you're hoping that replicates over and over again. It's a good point. I think it's that whole idea of mass of niches or the thing about TikTok, it feels very one-to-one. Even if everybody's wearing the same thing, it feels like it's just for you. That is what, you're right. I just think there is going to be a thing where someone wants someone to be like, this is where you go and buy all your clothes and it's easy and not everybody wants to be trendy. There are always going to be people who just want to look simple. There are so many options brand-wise. I just think there's too much noise and at some point, there's got to be someone you're like, this is my go-to. Also, because the thing about Uniqlo is you can't get any styling advice from Uniqlo. You see the campaigns and you're like, these people look insane, but you know how to do it. That's why you're able to do it. I think there are people who, I don't even want to bring up this word, but these idiots who use the quiet luxury idea. This girl in Omaha, Nebraska, who's like, I want to look quiet luxury, she doesn't really have anywhere to, I think if someone was like, you need to buy five t-shirts from Gap and a pair of jeans from there and a gold necklace and you're set, that's not everybody, but there's hundreds of millions of people who would want to dress like that. I just think there is, I think there's going to be a move towards that. I want someone to tell me what to do again, feeling that has gone away because of the way TikTok delivers this information and fragments it. And what that means, I don't know. Again, if as a business analyst, I'm just do what Abercrombie is doing and they've done a brilliant job. One trend that we should talk about very briefly are these RIP jeans. RIP jeans are a thing. The Rowe has RIP jeans. My partner, Rachel Sturgatz, bought the Rowe RIP jeans. They look great on her. I would never buy RIP jeans intentionally. It's just not my thing, but I somehow surfaced this Travis Kelsey photo of him in these very specifically slash jeans. No one on the internet could ID them. I looked on Essence. I went through three pages of men's denim on Essence that I was like, I'm not doing this. I'm not going to bother. Then I asked you, and you, of course, identified them immediately, tell us about these jeans. What do you think these jeans say about where our culture is right now? The jeans are hair-impressed in case anyone actually is wondering, which was interesting to me because I had totally forgotten about that brand and still exist. Still there, still making jeans that, I think there actually was a pair ungrilled for like $180 of some Travis Kelsey fan out there really wants them. You can go find them. Let's see if this makes sense. When I was growing up, you're a kid and you're into fashion. You think, what job could I have where I could dress however I want forever? The answer was always musician. If you were a musician, you could dress however you wanted forever. You thought about that? No. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Then I could dress however I want forever? I never thought about that once. I've never thought about that once in my life. In my brain, when I was entering the workforce, I was like, I'm going to have some structures around me. How could you avoid that? There's very few jobs, like artist, musician. Now, the main job that you can do that is pro-athlete. Pro-athlete, number one thing, you can dress however you want forever and people will always pay attention to it. They will always talk about it. Travis Kelsey is doing something with his outfits. I have no idea what that something is. I love it. He is so all over the place. I think it's so interesting because you cannot talk about Travis now without talking about Taylor Swift. She dresses, from my perspective, correct me if I'm wrong, fairly one note. Let's say fairly understandable. You can encapsulate how she dresses pretty clearly. Her clothes are really insane. But in a box. You can see the psychology. Sure. Yes. You see an outfit and you know that you could say, oh, she would wear that or she wouldn't. Her style is very identifiable. I think her style says a lot about the fact that she became famous when she was 14 years old, but we can talk about her another episode. But Travis Kelsey is like, I guess, I think, I can't remember if I wrote this when I interviewed him and wrote about it, but it's kind of like the essence sale just vomited a little bit. That's the best way to describe it. He's just constantly buying. I know this because when I interviewed him and then I spoke to some designers that have bought that he wears their clothes, he, at least at this time, was the one buying this stuff. He is on essence. He is buying from the Kid Super website. He's doing all of this himself, or at least he was, I should say. I don't know if that's changed post-Taylor, but he looks a little mad. She's not doing it. She's not doing it, but I do wonder now if the fear of God suit at the White House, it seemed like maybe he'd been styled in that. I just have a feeling. The way the pants fit seemed like a stylus mistake and he normally wears a big pant that was a very small pant. That was just my speculation. I don't know if he's working with anyone right now, but listen, he's a fashion fan. A lot of football players, I should say, a lot of football players, a lot of basketball players, dress similar to him. He just has so many eyeballs on him that we are taking notice of it when he wears the hair and press and rip jeans. I mean, every football player, or at least let's say half the NFL probably owns several pairs of a Mary rip jeans. This is how these guys like to dress a lot of the time, not to just lump them all together. I know you love a Mary, Jacob. When you're a pro athlete, you can wear whatever you want and he is just living that. I don't like how it looks a lot of the time. I don't think it's put together well, but good on him. He's wearing jeans that probably no human should wear, that look like they're diamond, they're a steel, like that diamond cut, that die cut pattern. That's what it looks like. It looks like he just rolled around on that. I don't get it. But who else can wear that? But no one can wear that to an office. Only a musician or a pro athlete could wear that, in my opinion. I think, I agree. I'm a big fan of his insane. Sometimes previous to the, I'd say the last year the clothes have gotten really out of control. He used to look a little better. Yeah. The Kentucky Derby outfit was just absolutely horrible. But again, I don't care. I'd rather him, the other big thing for me is fit and his clothes like technically fit usually. Like those pants are big on him, but in the way they're supposed to be big. I really hate poor fit when clothing fits poorly. And generally he does fit his clothes fit him in the way that they're supposed to. And I would say like previous to the last nine months or so, he, I thought his clothes were fine. They have gotten like yuckier and yuckier. And there is just something right now with that, like, it's that end of the Y2K era when the diesel jeans were like washed green and they were really ripped and they were really low and they were just gross and everybody looked gross. And I don't know. I think I love, I'd rather someone have bad taste than no taste, which is an epidemic in our culture right now is people just don't have any opinions of what to wear. So I mean, good, good on him and it's, it's fine, but it is funny that he is such a, he's such a trend maker and people are obsessed with what he wears and, and every little thing he does. It's, it's very interesting. Well, they're obsessed with what he wears. I don't think that he is sparking trends. I don't, I don't think that Travis Kelsey is a market mover. I don't, I don't, I don't think so. If you, if you, you have to remember again, let's think about the people in Omaha, Nebraska, like those kinds of jeans, also his, his, um, I guess his sister-in-law, Mahomes or whatever. It's not a sister. She had a pair of jeans. Who, who is it? Oh, is that his, the best friend? That's his quarterback. I didn't know who these people, I, I didn't, I didn't know who these people were up until nine months ago. Brittany Mahomes, Brittany Mahomes, Brittany Mahomes, when I was searching this, she was wearing a pair of these trashy jeans too. This is a thing now. These like these jeans, it's like, it was cool with like the Europeans who wear diesel and it's been a year and a half and now it's getting cool with people in Kentucky. And, and so I think he's reflective of where the culture is right now. That's, that's what I will say. So one, one more thing that I wanted to talk about, which is the story that you did on short length. So talking about what is correct, what is, what is correct to wear, which is what I think young people are obsessed with, like, what is the correct thing that I should be wearing right now. You have this piece about what the length of shorts are. So we've talked about short shorts and don't wear short shorts if you wear them too tight. It's bad. Just don't wear tight. Just don't wear tight. But you are saying that the trend with like cool guys, like throwing fits types are, are knee length shorts and baggy. Well, I never like to say I'm saying I'm, what, what, what I have, what my eyes and my, my eyes and my reporting have, have led me to, particularly my eyes, which is, you know, I should first of all say I've been at the journal for almost 10 years. So that's like 10 summers. It's incredibly hard at this. I shouldn't say incredibly hard. I write about clothes. Nothing is incredibly hard. But you know, at the start of every summer, you're like, what do I write about? I write about menswear. There's only very select few things I can write about. I've written about short lengths, probably every other summer at a minimum. So I've written probably five or six stories about this. Yeah. What I've realized over time, and it didn't make the piece, but in like my first draft, I kind of was just word vomiting. And what it made me think is like men are just becoming like, men have just fully, the male shopper fully become like the women shopper. Like back in the day, you know, hem skirt hemlines moved up and down. Women tried to jump on the bandwagon longer, shorter, what have you. Like it's always like, you know, the cliched stories we hear of, you know, runway shows out of Paris and then dictating how everything goes with short lengths. This is how men are now. Like men want to jump on what is again, correct, a certain contingent of men, I should say. And what has really happened is that the short short became so, the shorter short, the five inch and C became so, so mainstreamed through TikTok really, through, through social media, through, you know, virality effectively that people wanted to shift the other way to be different. And a lot of people I spoke with were completely candid about that, that they were going longer because it was different and they didn't want to look like, I think as I said in the piece, like the bros and Philly was how one designer put it. Like that's what it is. And, you know, there's not that much more thought behind it. You know, I think one of the sources said like objectively, he knew that he looked better in shorter shorts, but wearing longer shorts showed that he knew what was up. I think that that's valid. I think, like, I don't necessarily think a longer short looks great on everybody. Like, you know, those of us a bit south of six feet, you know, it might make you look a little more south of six feet if you wear a really long short, but people are willing to take that and, you know, be trendy for the sake of being trendy and good on them. Well, if you have really skinny legs, a longer short probably looks better. Yes, probably so. But I think even then it's like, then does your legs look really stumpy coming out of that then? Like it's because if it's longer and wider, which most of these are, like, it's a delicate balance. One reader did really take me to task for not talking about the kind of stature and body of it all in the piece. And they were probably right. I probably should have given a graph to that. But yeah. Well, I also think with that stuff, you can always find the right thing for you. Like I hate when people are like, I don't admit, low rise looks bad on me. It's like, actually, skinny jeans look terrible on most of you. And you all thought or really high waist. Everyone's like, the high waist is so, it's not flattering on everybody. You got to find the right thing for you. But I guess the question is, is this something that you saw happening on the runway and or is this a like tick tock slash just reactive thing? Did you because, you know, when the men still went loosened up, like that was a runway thing that you probably predicted five years before anyone else even tried. But this sounds like it might just be like a reactive thing that's more driven by social media and that. Well, no, I think actually, it is worth noting that on the runway shorts have gotten longer. Like I think a year ago, I actually think that that was what I wrote about coming out of Milan, maybe was that that silhouette was really starting to come through from the runways. But I think it's important to note though that because this is how every big company has to be now, they offer both short shorts and longer shorts, like every company, every brand has to be everything to everybody in a certain way. So like some, there are some brands that are like directional with it, I think, and that that's like the look they're pushing. But like, you know, you can go to Prada and get a fuller short and a shorter short, like if that's what you want, like that's, you know, yeah. So I think that that's important to note is that kind of it's a with runway brands, it's across the spectrum. It was interesting and reporting this, that people were pointing to kind of that mid tier of brand, if you will, that kind of like our legacy MF Penn universe, like that store Colbo in New York, that like those are where people are going to get the kind of fuller pleated short and that's like the look they're pushing. So I think that that's, you know, that's where it's coming through is like a quote unquote fashion thing more in my opinion. That's like where it's seeping through. Yeah.

One thing, I mean, I have all these photos of this guy on the Silver Lake Reservoir. This would have definitely been summer of 2020 wearing really short corduroy shorts because I wanted my husband to buy them and we looked forever to find these shorts. I never found them, but the, I was like looking at images the other day. I found all these like creepy photos of this guy's shorts. Cause I was like, you have to buy these shorts. These are the ones I think that's what they were. And like I also looked that up. I think I might have sent you the photo and been like, what are these? I need to get these from her. But do you think that this is like, cause the thing about most, when you think about jeans, so we're just talking about jeans with Travis, think about jeans, like anything goes with jeans now. And that's part of it is that like, yes, there are these micro trends and there are, there is a move away from like an ultra skinny jean. But then on the other hand, now like I, I am wearing a narrow, narrow or jean, even though everyone else, you know, like if you're a head, a behind a blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you can really wear whatever you want as long as you don't look dumpy. Do you think with the shorts thing that like we're nowhere near it being kind of gauche to wear shorter shorts? Oh no, we're nowhere near that. And I think that like this was the point that James Harris from throwing fits, who I interviewed for the piece, he kind of made this point when we were talking, which was like, he was saying, why are all these people obsessed with like being right? And I think that that was kind of what I was trying to probe in the piece a little bit was, you know, there's this notion of like, Oh, I have to be right. And I think that that's, that's, there's not a, an overall answer. Like I'm, I'm more of the opinion that with pants, you can go, you can be more wrong with pants. Like I actually think that, like it's very clear definitively that like a very skinny pant just really is not what looks good right now. Like that, I think we are reaching a consensus about that. Like when I talk to retailers, they're like, that's what's fallen off for us is like the really, really slim pant. Like we still sell slim, but like skinny is totally not selling for us. That consensus seems to be coming through with shorts. Listen, five inch inseams are going to stay for a while. There's going to be that contingent of young guy that cares about how they look that goes to the gym, that wants to show off some leg, that's become more normalized. So that is where we are now. The longer short is going to be a fashion thing. It's going to, where it's going to go through cycles, you know, there's going to be the up and down with it, but people will find the level and say, this is where I want to be. And believe me, there's still people that are at the seven, eight inch inseam length that are like, think it's crazy to go five inches, but they've always thought that. They've always been in that realm. They're not new to that thinking. So yeah. Yeah. So speaking of being correct, this week's rumor of the week is this report I did last week. Half of it's a rumor, half of it is definitely true. So the, the definitely true part of it is VF Corp owner of the North Face and Vans and a bunch of other kind of modern heritage brands also on Supreme. They have an activist investor who would really like them to sell off a bunch of its brands that are not vans and the North Face, which make it the most money and needed fixing. They would like them to sell Supreme. And they, VF hired Goldman Sachs to explore options. Now I heard from people last week in the world of these companies that Supreme got an offer from the Saudi PIF public investment fund to buy it and was reject, it was rejected. I couldn't get a conversation on that. I kind of think it's probably not true, but it's the thing that was going around. And then the other thing is, which is more interesting for both of us, maybe we can like try to chase each other on the story, but that there is someone who's trying to build a new strategic group that, and maybe you know more about this than I do already because you're closer to the stuff, but that's trying to build a new strategic group and Supreme would be like a big part of it. So, you know, if something's going to happen, it could happen in the next like couple of months. Like these processes, usually what happens is the process happens over like six or eight weeks. If they find someone, then it can take a year to do the negotiations or whatever. But if they don't find someone, then they just stop and then they go back to it. One interesting thing is Supreme is the only brand that's doing well at VF right now. Like they had double digit growth this past quarter, I think, whereas all the other brands, even the North Face, which have been doing well, because the other brands are really reliant on wholesale. And as we know, Supreme has like zero distribution. So I guess my question for you is, like, do you think they should sell it? And if they're going to sell it, we've talked about this in the past of like, who should they sell it to? Well, you know, it's interesting because like on the level, I guess that they should sell it. I think that the only way to talk about this though is to say selling it is an admission that acquiring it just wasn't that savvy to begin with. Like, you know, with hindsight, it seems like it was a misfire of an acquisition. They were not able to pump it in the way I think that they thought they were going to be able to. I think clearly looking back, the Carlyle Group did a very good job of getting it to a place where it was very tempting on the market. And I think VF jumped at it. And it has not expanded in the way that I expected, both in its footprint and I think in SKUs. I don't think it's like gone crazy in production because I don't think that you can do that to Supreme. Supreme will forever be reliant on being a little bit unattainable. So they've not taken it. They've not diluted the brand, which is good for where the brand sits now. But yeah, like, like it's impossible to talk about this without talking about the fact that like Vans is just like perpetually and it's just so dire that they're like, they're like, they're like, they're like, they're like everything else. You know, I just think you can't make cool happen and you can nudge it along maybe and all their little nudges are just doing nothing. Like, you know, people keep telling me, you know, oh, I'm buying Vans and all my friends are buying Vans. I don't really see that nor do I believe that. Like, I think that that consumer that was kind of with it, like we saw they in the past few years, they bought Sombas, they bought Gazelles, they bought Panda Ducks, like they are not maybe not Panda Ducks because Panda Ducks are oversaturated. But like, you know, I think that like with Vans, there was just no texture to it anymore. There was no cool factor. There was no desirability that you it wasn't they weren't doing any collabs that was putting it in front of people. They weren't getting it on the right people. Like in every way it just wasn't landing. Now as to Supreme, do I think it can sell? Sure. Do I have any guess of who will buy it? No, I think that that that it's a tough thing to it's kind of a tough buy ultimately because you're not it should be a private company. That's that's what I was going to ultimately say is I think I could see a universe in which James Jebya tries to get some funding and takes it back back private and says that was fun. You know, we did that for a little bit. Now we're back here. You know, maybe people will stop looking at us so closely if someone in the LVMH portfolio wants to call us again for a collab, we'll do that. But like we are not trying to just pump right now. And I think that that's probably the best place for it. You know, I think am I as a fan of Supreme glad that it didn't get incredibly blown out since it got acquired? Yeah, like I would have been a little bummed if it ended up with 500 stores or something like that or 250 stores. Like it's still really small comparatively. But it's impact. It's clout remains. It looms really large. You know, it's almost like the way people say we want to be the Uber of X. It's like people still say they want to be the Supreme of X. Like I get that. And but to buy it to acquire it and put it in a portfolio, like what are you really looking for with that? Like the name, like maybe now the thing is, is that what Supreme was able to get out of being owned by VF is that like when they worked with Timberland and North Face and you know, these places, I'm sure that it was better in terms of all that supply chain stuff and all that deal making. And you know, it would be a bit of a change in that regard, but I could easily see it just going back private. That seems to be the smartest route. And I'm sure someone would want to bankroll James Jebio to do that right now. Like I have no doubt about that. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's a very interesting situation where I don't know what kind of deal he makes with these people, but he's clearly made some sort of deal. Yes, he is brilliant. And, and the right thing to do is leave that brand alone and let him manage it. But most people would not do that. Like there's a way to make way more money out of it way more quickly. And the fact that they've allowed him to control the distribution and all of that stuff through three different investors that we know of, like who knows who was backing him in the earlier days. He must put something in it where he's like, I have to have control over how it's distributed and then also how it's distributed and then also who owns it and like who they get to sell it to. But I think you're right. I think it should be a private business. And it's just whatever happens. Like I hope BF does sell it and, and because it's not, it's clearly not right for a public company that is really just a portfolio of managed brands back on vans really quickly. I think it should be like Levi's. The funny thing about vans is I've never been able to wear them because I feel like a poser. Like I feel like a poser from seventh grade. Like I could never, I never wore them in seventh grade. I had air walks, but I could not have vans. It makes me feel like it's not, I'm not allowed to, it's literally the only sneaker that is around right now that I do not own any of. I actually don't feel, would not feel comfortable in like a gazelle either, but that's just because I'm not, like I feel like I would be trying to feel young. But, but I think, I think vans should be like Levi's and everybody has a pair of slip-ons. Like I have the Roe vans, but, but it's, it's, but I couldn't buy a pair of vans. It's now, you know, annoying to just talk about this and point to this, but we can't forget like the pandemic is really probably what did vans in. I don't think I'm alone in theorizing this. Like vans are not comfortable enough. They are a slip-on, but they got completely superseded by other slip-ons during the pandemic. Like that's when we saw the Crocs surge, the Birkenstock surge, the Ugg surge. So like that notion of like an easy on slip-on, that pitch disappeared and they are, as people that wear them often will tell you, like not a comfortable shoe. And that just, it's not been able to regain that market because yeah, you could say like, oh, our new pitch is going to be that we're super cool. But to your point, like they're a cool in a specific way. Like we have certain associations with them and they don't feel new. And I think the thing about the Samba was that it felt new. It didn't feel like it had been around even though it had, and they were able to really capitalize on that in a way that vans just totally has not been able to. I want to ask you a question though, which is this notion of a new group coming together, like someone wanting to start a new group. Why would you do this? Like I understand the, but like, you know, we're currently looking at the tapestry capri deal being maybe, you know, done or maybe, you know, held up or what have you. Carrying is in trouble. LVMH is the only one that's like really kind of crushing it. So like, what do we, why would you do this? Like, you know, I'm not smarter than an investor, but like, why would you do this? LVMH is not crushing it over. They are crushing it over there. Individually brands, they're in trouble. Everybody's in trouble right now. We keep getting a thumbs down on the Riverside imagery. It keeps doing thumbs down, thumbs down bubbles. It's very funny. I think the point of having a group is diversified portfolio. And if one brand isn't doing well, the other one is doing well, especially when you're private and, and what fashion people love to say, back end synergies. So like you can have shared resources, all that stuff. I still think that that's the way to go. And I think there's always going to be people who have ambitions to start a new group and do it in a better way. If you look at OTB, which I'm sure has tons of problems too, like they, he kind of did it. Renzo Rosso did it in his own way. These designers have a little bit of a, it's more about making clothes less about accessories. The reason LVMH does so well is because they have hospitality, food, they're, they're launching a media division. So it's diversified portfolio. I think, look, like this is an ambition of someone, I haven't done a lot of reporting on it. We should both do reporting on it and see who, who wins. But, and, and because I think it's really interesting if someone did put together a group with like-minded brands, and it was a private group backed by, you know, private funding, like for a while you, you build something up over 15 years. And then that is actually the kind of thing you can take public. Whereas like, and who knows what the public markets will look like 10 years from now, but it is the kind of thing that you could maybe start to put together. If you think of Ralph Lauren, like they're kind of their own group in that they don't own other brands. And they, they got rid of Club Monaco because it wasn't the right fit, but they have acquired all these other kinds of businesses along the way. So I think like, yes, it's not perfect, but it's also still, it gives you a little bit of padding in a way that like carrying, that's a tough stitch, but something will be, something will get better and it will be okay. And so an LVMH, whatever's happening individually at those brands, they can kind of cover it up with the other things. And you just make more profits too with a bigger group. So who knows? And this, it might be a pie in the sky thing and like a dream of someone who's obsessed with James Jebby or whatever, but who knows? Well, my mind went to New Guards, which is perhaps a conversation for us to have another day. Yes. Yeah. Well, Herron Preston owned by New Guards. Yes, Herron Preston owned by New Guards. Not a good situation. Herron, Herron call us. We'd love to talk about it. Yeah. Jacob, this was so fun as always. I'll talk to you during men's. Yeah, you'll be back in a week. So yeah. Can't wait. Okay, we'll talk soon. Fashion People is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck, hosted by Lauren Sherman. That's me.
