Hello and welcome to fashion people. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Puck's fashion and beauty memo line sheet. And today with me on the show is Jen Brill, creative director of Homegirls. We're talking zombie barnies, the best and worst dressed at Gigi's 30th, the future of shopping, and a whole lot more. Happy Tuesday everyone. I am back on the east coast. I'm headed to New York later this week. On Monday and Tuesday, line sheet was packed. It included an update on Saks's death situation from my colleague Bill Kohan, a teeny, teeny bit of Vanity Fair news for the people who really care. Plus Rachel's take on the Boy Smells candle scandal. My take is that people need to chill out. And if you do not know about what's going on with Boy Smells, it's probably best to read Rachel's item. There's also more Met Gala news-ish, more to come I'm sure. And I also raise the question, do brands need the Met Gala or do they just need a Gala? Oscar De La Renta's sponsorship of Save Venice, which happened last week, is a good way to think about it. What else is going on? Well on Monday I got into the state of Barney's post-Barnies, which Jen and I are also going to discuss. So all anyone wants to talk about is how much they miss Barney's. I'm giving the people what they want. Let's get going. Jen Breaux, welcome to Fashion People. Lauren Sherman, thank you so much for having me today. I'm sad we're not on the same coast. Wait, we're not? No, I'm in Miami. What are you doing in Miami? I'm visiting my in-laws. You're such a good daughter-in-law. I am not. It's been probably a year and a half. And they're nice. I like them. So can you imagine? Heaven. The ones I don't like. Heaven. It's good. How are you doing? I'm good. I'm live and direct from Mount Washington, Los Angeles. You know what I've been telling people about you? That you living in Mount Washington makes me feel better about living in LA. I tell people the same thing about you. She lives eight minutes from me. It's a good poem. Yes. It makes me feel like if you, one of the coolest, if not the coolest person in the world, lives in Mount Washington, then that it's okay. Well, they only knew. I wear full sweatsuits these days. sneakers. I know you're the best dress at the, the, what's it, the morning run? The school run? Nope. Just, just a mom wearing a pair of supreme sweatpants. Well, you are somehow still hugely influential on, on the industry, which we're going to talk about a bit later with the launch of homegirls latest issue or volume as you all call them. And then also the store, which I'm excited to hear more about from you. And I'm going to, I'm going to be in New York later this week. I'm definitely going to stop by. Oh, I'm sure Takun's going to be so excited to host you. It's so beautiful to shop. I'm pumped to see it and, and see the dry cleaning in action. It's really good. So it's funny. It's like a sort of slow news time out of Europe. There aren't a ton of, pretty much every creative director is settled, except for one, we'll wait and see. And there's some like financial stuff that I don't want to bore you with that's going on right now. But most of the news this week is really about retail and shopping. My colleague, Bill Kohan, who covers financial stuff for us has been writing a lot about sex. And on Monday, I had this piece that was sort of inspired by my trip to Japan on Barney's and sort of what happens when a retail brand dies, but like doesn't totally go away. They were acquired by, when Barney's went bankrupt, the IP was acquired by authentic brands group, which is a brand management firm that owns a lot of different things. And they sort of, their job is to make sure the brand stays alive, but to also put it in as many places as possible. So while the, the Barney's we all know and love is sort of half alive in Japan, where they have two locations and it looks like 2016 Barney's. There are also coffee shops in Oahu in Honolulu. Oh, wow. Interesting. Wait, I just mixed up Dean and DeLuca and Barney's. Mom, Brandon. You know, it's funny though, I mentioned Dean and DeLuca in this Barney's piece because there are so many of these stores and restaurants. There's a buttermilk channel in, which is closed in Brooklyn. I'm not familiar with buttermilk. Wait, it's a Carol. It was in Carroll Gardens. It was very like 2011 Carroll Gardens Maple Bacon. Yum. It was great. They still have another restaurant, which I can't remember the name, but it's on Atlantic and I like Boreham Hill or something, but they, there's a buttermilk channel that's still going in Japan. I ate at Dean and DeLuca. I ate at City Bakery. All these things. Yeah. City Bakery, that's very impressive. To me, that's actually like a deep New York cut. Yeah. And I'm surprised that it exists in Japan. Yeah. It is very nice. They have several locations and what else was there? City Bakery, there's Ron Herman is still there. There was an amazing, and Brooks Brothers obviously is still around here, but the one there is like Pristine. Feels throwback to Tom Brown era, Brooks Brothers level of like attention to detail and everything. So it was interesting, but as Barney's is thriving in Tokyo and maybe other places in Japan that I don't even know about, it's also still, it still exists here. So there was a collaboration with Forever 21. There was a potential magazine that was supposed to launch an art Basel in Miami. I want to say two years ago that never materialized. I think I might have an update on that later this week if anything's going on with it. And then there are, there's a private label thing that they're trying to redevelop that I was told it was at first supposed to be at SACS. Now it's probably going to be much more widely distributed and maybe the price point will be lower. There's a lot. And then of course there are the residences on a property at like a gated community in Tulum that are called the Barney's residences. Yeah. So it's a lot. I'm curious as a board and bread New Yorker. Is that correct? Correct. Upper East Side East 63rd Street, 63rd and 2nd Avenue. So Barney's was part, I'm pretty sure I was there at least two times a week for the 90s. I was window shopping 99.9% of the time, but I was there quite a bit during the golden era. What was the first thing you ever bought there? I remember Makeup Forever launching and that was the first place I laid eyes on the collection and make up obviously for a teenager section entry point at a department store. So it was a lot of fussing around the make up department, touching helmet laying for the first time, touching Catherine Hamnett for the first time, being introduced to Kationa Deli at Barney's in the year 2000, I think, Darryl Kaye's Cigarette Jeans. So I spent a lot of time just trying things on and then saving my money for summer to go in there and buy something or to beg my mom for something that was on sale. I actually remember buying a Barney's collection, chocolate brown single breasted long shearling coat. I begged Agatha and she bought it for me, but I spent a lot of time just window shopping. It was a really magical, joyful place. It was obviously very expensive but not intimidating. I think Bergdorf, which I love and loved then just felt a bit more funny duddy and for someone's grandmother perhaps and with all due respect of course, but Barney's felt like the woman that I wanted to be when I was able to shop. Totally. I moved to New York in 05 and it still felt like that. And I remember I bought a Phillip Lim, this probably 0607, a Phillip Lim skirt suit that was on sale, but I had them send it to my office downtown. It was like 75 extra bucks, which I didn't have, but it was like you could just send it to my office downtown. Amazing. Amazing. Yeah, there was such a place of joy and inspiration and their advertising was incredible and so punk rock and unlike anything during that time. And it's something that freedom and energy doesn't exist in advertising today. No. And you think about all the people who work there, not only obviously the Julie Gilharts and... Wani Newhouse, Simon Dunin. There are so many great minds there. The imagination ran wild. Dennis Friedman, Glen O'Brien. And I was actually, I just received this in the mail maybe six weeks ago, but there was a catalog that they made I think in 1997 and there's an article written about it in The Times because there were no designers or product descriptions or prices, Lauren. It was like a book of photography with clothing, of course, but there was zero description of the clothing that was in the catalog. And The New York Times wrote an article that was kind of like, has this department store lost their minds? And yeah, it was just really rebellious and yeah, very special what they did. Did you, when it, when it shut down, how did you feel? Did you care? I had already mourned the death of Barney's and the Barney's that I grew up loving on many moons before. Like, I can't even tell you when it closed down. Can you tell me? It was 2019. It does feel like it was earlier than that. Right. Right. It made its big move on 16. Screwed is that right? Mm-hmm. And reopened in the first Barney's space. So and they spent millions of dollars on this, on this refresh of the space that was Barney's, then Lomans, the off-price retailer that used to be a part of the same company. Right. Where I bought my first mark by Mark Jacobsbag. Yeah. Lomans was a huge part of every New Yorker's life. So good. And then they reopened it, had an amazing spiral staircase and they, and they really tried to, they put a ton of money into the store design for many of the stores, but that 16th Street one was the, was the crown jewel. Right. And it was something, Barney's on Madison and in its original iteration on 16th Street was never that glossy. Yeah. And this iteration you're speaking of was so over the top, lots of bells and whistles. So to me, it was kind of like not the essence of the brand that we worship and adore. Yeah. It, it now, and the, the one in Tokyo feels very similar to that era. It really reminds me of mid to 2010s sort of, I don't want to say the peak of luxury because that came 10 years later, but that's sort of the really rise of big luxury and everything is marble, everything is shiny and everything is black. And the sort of, you mentioned Katya on Adele, who is someone who I feel like is revered as a designer. I remember when she was secretly designing, I want to say Helmut Lang or something like that. Yeah. She was, she was designed, I don't, don't quote me. It might have been, what's the other brands that fast, no, it was Helmut Lang. Wow. And who knows that? Yeah. And she didn't, she doesn't like being public. So I don't know what she does now. She probably consults on something else, but she's also a designer. No one really speaks about. And like, I doubt the kids are collecting Katya on Adele and they should be buying shrunken hoodies and, you know, little tight skinny jeans, but I'm sure they're not. Well, maybe they will in the same way this generation is like very into Romeo, Gilly. Right. Like maybe the next generation will be into Daryl King, Katya on Adele. And something that I'm always thinking about is how the next generation tends to cling on to the things that we hated from our youth. So like true religion. Totally. Yes. You know what I mean? And it's something that I find Jen's years are kids that I think are so chic and cool. Love. It's very much to me what Glenn Martins has done at Diesel, which is that like really grotesque. I remember freshman year of college, I had a pair of diesel jeans also, but. Yes, I love diesel jeans. And they were, I remember there was one pair that were like really wore, they were washed to be green and it looked like you rolled around in the grass. Of course. Of course. And I feel like he digs into the sort of grotesque, right? Ness of that and then makes it feel glamorous and cool. Right. He sort of nails that in a very specific way. But yes, the true religion today, flying, I'm in Miami and flying from LA to Miami. I saw so much Juicy Couture and it really felt like Y2K. Right. And those are the things that I was in drawn to. So it's actually, it's interesting to think about the next generation and whether or not Barneys will resonate with them. And I'm excited to see what happens with the brand because it's of course nostalgic for us and we were able to experience the store in person. But I wonder if it means the same thing to Gen Z. For sure. And these brands also, so many things are just taking on totally different meetings. Do you know about this? You probably do because your kid is a little bit older. Do you know about this concept? They've totally divorced the idea of preppy from the actual definition of preppy? No. So if you just Google like what does preppy mean to Gen Z, essentially what comes up is nothing about preppy culture or anything connected to Ivy League or anything connected to East Coast. The Kennedy is. No. It's like, I don't even, it's like, what is it? Love shack fancy is preppy. Wow. And pink and pretty and nice, Stanley cups. Wow. It's very fascinating. I know about the Stanley cups because I see them everywhere. Everywhere. But that's increasing that they've connected those items to preppy. Yeah. So we'll see. Look, the thing about authentic brands group is what else is going to happen to all these brands? They're just going to die. So you have to respect that they are doing something with them. I think people are, I talked to a lot of people in retail or big shoppers who really miss the experience of somewhere like Barney's. And that I think there could be something new, but it requires a, a ton of money. B, it requires someone. The thing that I always come back to is like, when someone walks into a store, if it's not a single brand, if it's multi-brand, they're going to try a bunch of stuff on. And what they're most likely going to do is walk out and go on their phone and find it for cheaper somewhere else. And that's it. So you have to build a store knowing that most of the people are just going to come in and look and maybe buy something somewhere else. Right. Essentially a showroom. Yeah. At this point. Yeah. So that part of it's tricky, but at the same time, have you been to New York since PromTomp opened? I haven't been to the shop now. What is it like? Well, it's interesting because to me, we'll see. I have no idea how they're doing retail wise. It's very much about the FNB, the food and beverage. And the interiors are insane. They're incredible. I think it's a destination. To me, it's not what we want from a store, which is a million different things and a million different brands and to try a denim bar or whatever. It's not that. It's like, you go in, it's right by our offices. I'm sure I'll buy beauty products there in the next two weeks because I'll need something and it's right there. But mostly, I'd say it's for the experience and you go and you buy one thing as a souvenir or something. But I think what it's done is ignited people to want that kind of retail. And also, the makeup of the city has changed. A lot of people are moving back up to the Upper East Side and there's not really... I guess Bergdorf is up there, but that's not that far up. There isn't really anything up in that shopping area that's multi-brand. There used to be five-story. That might still exist, but I'm not sure. But there used to be more. There was Barney's, obviously. And there are also a lot of people living downtown or living in Brooklyn and want to come into the city, but maybe don't want to go all the way uptown. It's like three different cities in one. So I think there's an appetite for more. I told one of my readers to go to Luiso Vie Roma when she was there the last time and she bought a ton of stuff. But there's not... I feel it. I don't know. I definitely feel it in LA. I wish there was more shopping. Yeah. Do you think the desire for retail theaters still exist? Or is that too extra performative, expensive of another era? I think the desire exists in people's minds. Question is, are we going to go to Beverly Hills to go shopping? No. We go to the Row. We go to Scout. We go to Varsity. We go to Dover Street. And that's it? And that's it. And that's really pushing it. Yeah. And the Row is the furthest west, right? Yes. So that's the... I remember years ago saying this to someone at Saks. They used to have a little shop in Pasadena. And I said, oh, you should do that. You should have that. I would go all the time and they were like, no one goes. Everybody goes to Beverly Hills or they're private clients and they get everything sent to their house. I think that's a big thing in LA. A friend of mine just asked about men's wear shops in LA and I was like, here are the seven things. But that's... The intention is to go. But I do think it's more like an event where Dover Street is a thing where I feel like I need to go. When we were in Tokyo, I felt... Even though I've just been in London, and Paris, and we live not far from the one in LA, I felt like I needed to go just to see what they were doing at that one. It's like a beautiful experience. It's so considered. The buy is so tight. Like it's a really nice experience. I think from city to city and they all have their own identity.

Follow and listen to Train to Kill on the free Odyssey app or wherever you get your podcasts. So with Homegirls, how did you all decide to open a store? I think it's been a long time coming. So you came on with Takuna at the second issue, right? The second or third issue. Maybe I came on on the third issue. Yum. And I ran into Takun. He was getting a haircut. So was my husband. And I hadn't seen him in years. We hadn't known each other very well. And we had a coffee and he was like, guess what? I'm doing this magazine called Homegirls. And I had seen it and was so surprised that it was his passion project. And we just got along so well and talked more than we ever had. And he was like, do you want to work on it with me? And I had to think about it because I'd never done a magazine. And I'm quite private. So I was really nervous about doing this thing that everyone would know I was doing. And I spoke to Carol Lim and she was like, you're doing it. You're saying yes. You're a yes guy. And it has been such a source of inspiration and joy and fun and a burst of energy and a way to meet someone and have a nice conversation with them and not even know what their photography looks like and do something with them. You know, a celebration of women, of human, of people and amazing stories and people from all different walks of life. I feel really lucky it's been so fun. Yeah. The thing you just said about meeting someone and not even knowing what their work looks like and just going with it, you can't, that's what makes a magazine good. I think so. It's energy. It's just like energy. Yeah. I was just listening to, do you ever listen to the Ruthie Rogers, the River Cafe owners podcast? No, but she doesn't. It's really good. Yes. And the audio is not great, but you know, we all win some and lose some. It's usually fine. She has great people on. She has like a lot of directors on those types, but she had on the founders of Frees who were amazing. Maybe it was just the woman because it's, yeah, I think it may have just been the woman who's the co-founder of Frees, but they were talking about Frees started as a magazine and in the early 90s in London, as that art scene was exploding and there was no magazine and they just sort of, people just did stuff. And that sort of creative off the cuff, just wanting to have fun with it. I feel like doesn't exist as much as it should. And is one of the reasons you all have been so successful with it? Thank you. It's a lot of fun. I mean, of course, it's a balance and there's advertisers and partners and there's, you know, that side of the business, but it's also a joy. But I really, really appreciate the freedom and that's kind of how we try to approach our collaborations with photographers and stylists and cover stars is like, there's freedom. Like what we're all here, what are we going to do together? So this recent volume that was just released a couple of weeks ago, what was the sort of big idea behind it for you all? I think we're kind of like in a lot of ways, like human first. And I personally get really excited about people's stories. I get excited about people full stop. And of course, we love Nepo babies. Of course, we love pop stars, but we also love the underdog. You know, so I think it's like striking the right balance of like the underdog, the curveball, and then maybe the expected. We were fortunate enough to shoot Jenny from Blackpink, who of course has a really exciting solo career and we've been wanting to shoot her for years now. And the timing really worked out on this and we were excited about her self-expression as a solo artist, post euphoria, post Blackpink. And I really respect her grind and her work ethic. This is someone who hasn't been handed anything. We were done shooting at, I would say like 7 or 8 p.m. and she went to rehearse after a day of being in the studio. We also shot Ronelle Medrano, who is a New York based artist and she had this idea to shoot a self-portrait story. She's a born and bred New Yorker. She's from the Bronx. She's Dominican. And I've just really admired her work and world that she's carved out. Yeah, it seems like you all, I don't know, it just feels, it was really fun when I was in Tokyo. I went to Daiganyama Tea Site, the big bookstore that everybody says, go to the tea site, go to tea site and it really lives up to it. But you all had like a corner space on the International Magazine desk. It was amazing and there were all these girls, it felt really like young girls being into something and it's hard to capture that sort of essence in an era when everything is so fleeting. Totally. I think community is a term that's so overused, but that's essentially what a magazine is, people behind the camera, all the talent in front of the camera. Yeah, and we have ravenous kids who love the magazine, which is so fun to see. And now they have a place to see the magazine come to life. Yeah, so tell me a little bit about the store. And so for everyone listening, Takun Panichkel, who is the editor-in-chief of Homegirls, is doing a Q&A with our retail correspondent, Sarah Shapiro, in Tuesday's issue. You should check that out because he's going to get into, Takun's really interesting because he started as a fashion editor. He was actually on the podcast like, I don't know, probably a year ago, but he started as a fashion editor and then was a fashion designer for many years and then launched his magazine and launched a brand out of the magazine, which is fascinating and that has done really well. It sold at wholesale, sold direct on your all's website. But now you opened a store on Walker Street, like sort of Tribeca Chinatown, I would say. Yeah, it's a beautiful little jewel box. I think it's 250 square feet on Walker Street in the heart of Chinatown. Rafael Ducardonos and his amazing team did the design. We've been laughing and saying that it's so nice to work with people that are in our age group. It's done so well. It's just like, it's been produced at such a high level. The materials are beautiful. The design is flawless. It's just a really beautiful shopping experience. It's awesome. But Takun has been inspired by our dry cleaner for a while and has always had this idea of having a retail shop with this idea of maybe you walk by and you think it's an actual dry cleaner or if you know, you know. Yeah. So there's some fun surprises there, but you'll be able to find Homegirls shirting, the full collection, boxer shorts, the magazine. We also imagine that it's quite modular and we can bring in brand partners and do some fun things there that aren't necessarily related to the collection. Yeah, it's interesting because the thing that I think Homegirls has done really well is the brand partnership. Obviously, I was watching because of Takun, but that Chanel issue really sort of anytime someone can make an advertisement better than most of the original stuff that's out there, I'm interested because we're all doing this in the service of commerce. So it's sort of acknowledging the reality and then actually having fun with it. And so as someone who worked mostly with brands before doing this, said you never did a magazine, like is it any different from the projects you do with big brands or? Absolutely. I think because it's in an editorial context, brands give a lot more freedom and there is a need for it to feel organic to the platform or else there's no point in doing it. They should just execute it on their own. So there's a lot of trust and we're really lucky to work with amazing advertisers and partners that really want it to look like us. And I also, I personally love tension and rules and being able to kind of like break the rules with it. So it's like nice to have all the different levels from the conversation with a stranger. I'm like, I'm sure they take great photos. They're so fun to talk to or like they have great ideas to satisfying our advertisers to a brand partnership to a Brill-Brell studio advertising job. So there's quite a nice gradient in my day to day. The good thing about media and even when you're bi-annual or quarterly or whatever, you know, is that it doesn't have to be perfect. There's always another chance. Yes. And I think that that's actually what resonates with readers and it's like, it's energy, right? And sometimes you, sometimes you nail it and sometimes you don't. I really respect mistakes in general. I respect people trying new things. It scares me when someone has like a pristine portfolio of like perfect work. Like you need to try something new and sometimes when you do, you screw it up. And I really respect those mistakes. And with jobs and advertising, it's so dialled. Yeah. Well, I hope they're inspired by what you all are doing. Each spring, 23 Pulitzer Prizes are awarded for distinguished journalism, books, drama, and music.

But is this, I wanted to chat with you about, I'd love to always put something a little lighter in. Gigi Hadid celebrated her 30th birthday on Friday. I feel like there is a chance, if you were in New York, you would have been invited to this party. You know what, I don't know the Hadids. I love them and adore them from afar. Gigi looked great in leather, jeans, and a tank. Like a corseted bodice, I believe, by Kate. I got a- No, it wasn't corseted, was it? It was a little, it was like a bodysuit that was a- Maybe there was like some hidden- Yes. ...erciting. Yes, it was like a little bit of, or seeming that looked like corseting. Who made the leather pant? I believe it's both Kate. Let me look at the press release. Shout out to Kate Holstein. She looked great. Yeah, seriously. I thought she looked so good. Yeah, she's beautiful. Her looks, I'm not always super into. It always feels like a little bit, although I love her line guest in Residence. I think it's really good. But her personal style is like a little forced to me typically, but this this Gigi look, I just thought she looked absolutely dynamite. And if you were turning 30, this is what, like, not you, but if someone's turning 30, this is what they should wear to their 30th birthday. You know, I have a thing about, maybe because I'm short, the scale of evening bags are crucial to me. And I've never been a big evening bag kind of human. And the bag seemed really big for an evening purse. What do you think was in it? And do you have that same feeling because you're also a petite woman? Oh, I'm not petite, Jen. I'm five-eight. Oh, my gosh. I'm large. She's tall. I just kind of hunch a little. Right. I think because I probably, when I was younger, not as comfortable with being tall. Well, how do you feel then as a woman that's five-eight about an oversized evening bag? So let me look up the actual size of the one she was wearing. I do carry a fairly, so my big thing now is I don't, all bags feel too big and the little bags feel silly. And so I, if I can, if I'm going out and I'm not, I don't have my laptop, I try not to carry a bag. I just wear a jacket with pockets and carry stuff in there. I was actually thinking about this for, I'm going to New York for this trip and I'll have to go to a lot of stuff. And I did bring, I have like an Isaac Reina really simple black patent envelope bag that is, it's, but it's fairly large, I will say. I don't mind and I don't, it's, but it's flat. So you, it's not like you put a lot of stuff in it. It's just that the stuff needs to be distributed differently. I would say she's quite tall, right? Yeah. Okay. So maybe it's just like my on personal thing. I'm like, it's a clutch. This is quite large. It feels, oh, you know what? I think this bag is Kate, which is actually, I've seen, it's funny. Is it Kate? Let's see. Don't quote me on any of this. I don't know. But I think I understand what you mean. It does feel like, if I were her, why does she need a bag? This is the question. Like maybe that's the future. Yeah. Maybe what kind of bag do you carry when you go out? I don't know. It's, I mean, it's, I'm always, there's like a little, do you remember Pookie Birch's brand? Trademark? Trademark. Yeah. So there is a trademark black leather basket that I still wear. There's a Mark Cross basket that I've also been wearing. I love Chanel bags. I live in Chanel bags, to your point. That's like, almost embarrassing. Those, that's kind of like what's in, on rotation. I did see Bella and her best friend, Alana, who's a photographer and she's holding a Vakara Mark Jacobs purse, or she was wearing one last night or whenever the birthday party was. The one with the Bill with Mark's face on it, which I thought was quite cute. That's fun. I loved that those girls were wearing Capris. They look amazing. They look really, really, really, really cute. They look so, everyone looked great going into this, this event. I would say the, the influencer who walked in with Will Arnett, but apparently not with Will Arnett, just next to him. Her look was a little more aggressive than everyone else's, a little less polished, but everybody really did it. There's a lot of black. A lot of black. A lot of black. Shout out to Alistair, who was there in his signature block hat. Alistair McKim. For creative director at Something at French Vogue, and does a bunch of other cool, great work, former editor-in-chief of ID. He was there with like his crew, his, his girlfriend, Mario Sorrenti, Mary Fray. Mary looked great. She always looks great. She's ageless. She looked great. She's very like denim in a t-shirt, something like that, and always looks perfect. She looked very good. Anne Hathaway and her husband looked fine. She's looking, her face is looking great these days. Her face looks so good. Let's call it. The internet, TikTok is chatting. It's, it is remarkable. She looks better than she's ever looked. Correct. It's, it's, um, and her husband looked very, um, happy to be accompanying her to this party. I wonder how her and Gigi Hadid are friends. I also heard that Taylor Swift was there, but I, I haven't seen any photos. That, that is what I need to see. I'm, anytime I don't get a look at the, at her and Travis Kelsey for, you know, more than a month I get sad. It's very inspiring to me. But they looked good. I mean, do you feel like people were that polished when we were 30? I don't know. That's a really good question. 30. Were we still having fun with fashion or were we polished? I don't know. I don't think I've ever been polished. Do you have moments of polish? I feel like I always look a little tattered and messy and I think I look polished and then I go somewhere and I'm like, oh, hmm, it's not ever going to happen. Like I had lunch. LA. Yeah, tell me. Yeah. I had lunch a couple of weeks ago with someone and she had on this amazing, she had like jean shorts and a Mew Mew shirt, I think, and then Mew Mew shoes and a Louis Vuitton bag and she looked, but she looked really cool. Like it was tons of designer, but she looked awesome. And I like got up and I just was like, I don't know. What were you wearing? I was wearing jeans and did I wear little pumps maybe and a t-shirt and a blazer, which is like my thing in LA, but it just didn't look, she looked like very perfect for Friday lunch in LA. And I looked like a little rumbled and sort of. Listen, we're East Side girls. It's just dustier, it's drier, it's hotter. We're in Levi's and a vintage t-shirt and we're dressed up. Yeah. A ballet slipper is very, very decked out for me these days. Yeah. I've been thinking about getting some new Martiniano ones actually. Cute. I just got really good silver and black Chanel fallies from the shop last week. You have the best Chanel shoes. Hey, I mean, you can easily go to the store. Maybe we can go together and go shopping. Let's do it. Let's maybe we can do that on before we go. Before we go to our Tory dinner? Yes. We'll go to Tory, then we'll go to Tory. We'll go to Chanel, then we'll go to Tory, and then we'll go to Tory dinner. Maybe we can spend the night on the West Side. So then we can just go to dinner, spend the night on the West Side, and then go to Chanel when it opens the next day. I love it. Let's do it. Girls weekend, but a Monday night. Jen, thank you for being on Fashion People. This was so fun. What an honor. Thank you so much for having me, Lauren. And congrats on everything. I'm so excited to check out the store. Me too.
