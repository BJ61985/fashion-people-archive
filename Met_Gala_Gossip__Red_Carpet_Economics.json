And joining me today is the Wall Street Journal's one and only men's fashion columnist, Jacob Gallagher. We're going to talk all things Met Gala, from the parties to the red carpet, a little on the Nike Bodie collaboration. I think it looks great. And yes, we will address the Prada sample sale, the big news of the weekend. Plus, have I got a rumor of the week for you? Happy Tuesday. Welcome to Fashion People. It's been one heck of a week for me. I flew in to New York from LA last Monday to attend the Ralph Lauren show, and I had dinner at the Polo Bar. I had a burger, as I promised you all. And then Wednesday, I was over at Labanue at Saks to host a Puck private dinner. It was off the record. It was very fun. Everyone had a good time. Thanks to Mark Metric and the whole team there. You're the best. And then from Thursday on, it was just like party, party, party. This is not my natural way of doing things. I like to go to about like 9.30. But I will say that leading up to the Met Ball, going to all these parties is really helpful just to see a lot of people. I don't have to schedule hour-long coffees with everyone and get to catch up and obviously do some reporting. And I saw so many different kinds of people. I saw Nick Brown. I saw Emily Bodie. I saw Dora Fung. Victor Glamade. Darnell. Reina. Mark Wadicci. Chloe Moll. Nick Ramis. Like every person that I would like to say hi to, but probably only see every six months or once a year or at another party, which is really, really nice. So that was very helpful. And it actually helped me a bit as I was putting together this Monday email. It was very, very Met Gala focused and kind of looking at the past, why the Met is important to the business of fashion and also its future. So definitely check that out. And there's other tidbits if you're kind of like sick of hearing about the Met. I have some news regarding real estate and the Rowe, our favorite brand. Not really our favorite brand, but my favorite brand. And also some CMO activity at both Mark Jacobs and the Gap. So I love these HR updates. Send me the HR news. I would absolutely love to be the HR lady for the entire fashion industry. So please keep those updates coming. And if you are not subscribed to Puck, don't even try to pull some move where you start listening to this and you're like, I'm at the podcast. I'm a big Lauren Sherman fan. Whatever. You need to sign up to Puck. You can see all the emails. I know who is, who is on there. But let's get started with the show. Hey, Jacob. Hi. How's it going? It's going well, you know, just got off my couch after two and a half hours of listening to how stunning everything was and how everyone was going to have the best night of their lives. And yeah. You know, I am at my friend's house who is the executive editor of a big magazine. I don't want to out her here as being my friend, but I'm here with her and her digital team. And it was a complete chaos. Cause the stream was going and then they were all talking. And then also her kid was running around singing songs I've never heard. And I was like, I should have just stayed at the office. It's fine. I know I had a great time. Person who invited me over. This was really fun. But let's keep them waiting for our Met Gala impressions. And let's talk a bit about what else is going on. So first question, did you go to the Prada sample sale this weekend? I did not. And I now maybe regret not doing that based on what I've heard, but you are you a big sample sale person. I did. I went. I am not a big sample sale person because I have had the experience of the past where the things I buy from a sample sale, I never actually wear that much. I convinced myself into it. So I tend to avoid them, but this one was good. It was good. I'm wearing the one of the jackets I got like a, I don't know. It's a check. It's a plaid. It's like a menswear fabric, but it's in the shape of like a long jacket. It's really nice. I got a cashmere wool jacket that feels very Rafe, Jill Sandra era, which it was like 200 bucks. And then I got, what was the one other thing that I got? I can't, oh, I got this gorgeous, gorgeous runway dress that was insane amount of money that I got for nothing. And I'll wear it to events and book events this fall when I'm promoting my book, selling sexy. Yeah. The corporate history of Victoria's secret. You should pre-order it right now. But yeah. So I, and then I bought a couple of things for a friend and she seemed happy, but I don't normally go. It was just so orderly. I was very impressed by it. So Victoria is firing on all cylinders and that also includes the sample sales. So let's move on since you didn't go and talk really, really quickly about this Nike collaboration. Cause you did get the Bodie Nikes. About the Bodie Nikes, about two pairs of the shorts from the apparel collection as well. I think it looked really good. And I tried to buy a pair of the shorts online and they were already sold out, which impressed me. The shoes sold out really fast, but it seemed like the main collection sold out fast too, the clothing. Yeah. I think it looked great. I think it did exactly what it needed to do for both entities. I think it's interesting. This is maybe jumping ahead a little bit, but I think, you know, I watched the resale market for the shoes in particular, for the sneakers in particular. And it's, you know, there, but it's not crazy. And I think that that is indicative of, you know, maybe five years ago, this collab would have been fetching Tom Sacks level Nike prices. Maybe not that high actually, but like, you know, maybe two, three times retail. It's not quite doing that, not to just make everything about the resale market. But I think it does speak to like Nike, perhaps not having the magic sauce anymore in that universe, despite this being what I thought was quite a successful, you know, pairing. So you would say it's more about Nike and less about Bodie that the resale, it's more about the way Nike's distributing stuff. What do you think it is exactly that's going on with them in this? There's a lot going on with Nike, but in this particular circumstance, I think that it's a self fulfilling thing in a way where the resale market has tipped downward with people having less capital just to spend on sneakers. You know, we've seen this across, you know, asset markets from watches to crypto sneakers, which were, you know, particularly during COVID, having this real crazy peak. And I think as a result, you know, resellers are not investing as much capital into buying every single drop because they know that the market is not going to be there to just collect like that, which in a way, I think probably, you know, I can't speak for Emily or Aaron or any of the Bodie team, but like, I think maybe that's probably closer to what they would have wanted out of the collab is that the people that got it are going to wear it. I've seen a lot of the sneakers around in New York and that seems to be a better outcome in a way for the designer. But, you know, for Nike, I mean, hype does not last forever. And we're kind of watching it happen in real time with every passing release that they do. Yeah. I mean, Nike requires a full episode of an hour and 45 minutes for all the producers at Odyssey that would like to kill me. But eventually we will have to do it. And we can at some point, because it's many episodes. The interesting, I ran into Emily this weekend. And the thing that's interesting about Bodie is I do believe they really want it to be a lifestyle. I also went to, I didn't go inside, but one night I went to the river. Oh. Is that what it's called? Or is it just river? I think I've only referred to it as river, but. Okay. I don't know. I don't know. And someone was like, I, there's a thing. I went to the hate reads party, but it was over. So I just left. Also, there was a styles exclusive. So there was supposed to not be any other coverage. But by the time I got there, it was over. I didn't even realize they were connected to that. But I guess Green River Project, Aaron, Emily Bodie's husband. The point being, these people want to create a lifestyle. And they're always talking about how they want to create their life. So when you want to talk about who the next Ralph Lauren is or whatever, you go into their stores, they are doing something that I would say is a bit more thoughtful and, and strategic than a lot of other young American brands. And the Nike collaboration is an example of that kind of being scaled up. Like there were people in our office, Alex Bigler, the best dressed person at Puck, she is not a Bodie person. I guess you could see her one of the camp shirts, but she's not a Bodie person, but she, she tried to get the sneakers. Everybody wanted those sneakers. And so that to me says something about, OK, this brand does translate outside of the world outside of Sam Heinz universe. Yeah. And I think end of the day, it's good product. Like I really like the shorts are great. They're good for, you know, and they were the right price point for, I think, what they are. They're kind of the Bodie cut at a third, a half the price. And the sneakers are an interesting silhouette in terms of the sole in particular. They're just a nice looking sneaker. I've not worn them as much as my wife has a pair as well. She's worn them probably every other day since she got them. They're a good looking shoe. And I think end of the day, she, Emily is delivering good product, whether at her brand or at Nike. And so into what you're saying, it is kind of a test in that world where it's branching out a little bit to more athletic categories. And I think she has a lot of runway to go there clearly. And will everything have the hype of a Nike collab? No. But, you know, her interests seem to be pretty broad and where she wants to take the brand. Yeah, that makes sense. Good luck to her. It'll be interesting to watch. So I know everybody wants us to talk about the Met and I keep selling, but one thing I wanted to make one correction. We got a text from our friend, Gian. How do you pronounce his last name? Deleon? I say Gian Deleon, but I probably mispronounce it. As my coworkers could attest, I mispronounce almost everyone's name all the time. I'm terrible at pronunciations. Same. Same. It's fine. So Gian is the men's fashion director at Nordstrom. He might have a fancier title than that, but that's basically what he does. He texted us the other day. We got a lot of texts. We got a lot of responses to our first collaboration. It was very flattering. I got one from one of your old coworkers saying, my Jacob. Just my Jacob. I know who that is and hello to her. Yeah, that's very nice. But anyway, so we got a text from Gian saying, you were wrong about the Steve Jobs shoes and they were the 992s actually that he wore. Is that what he said? Let me do a live check to make sure that we have it right here. They were the here it is for the record. Steve Jobs wore the 992. The 992. That's right. The 992. And of course he would know that. I have been on press appointments before with Gian, where it is a kind of harrowing and infantilizing experience where he knows so much about every single thing about. I was at a Ralph Lauren appointment once and he was talking about the legacy of Polo Sport and both the PR and I were just completely lost to whatever he point he was trying to make about sneakers at that point. But that is what makes him so exceptional at what he does. And so I'm glad that he knew that off the top of his head. I regret the error on my end from our first episode. But yes, this is why Gian makes the big bucks. Pete Nordstrom give Gian another raise. He deserves it. Or Sam, Gian's boss can give him a raise. This show is brought to you by Boca.

So moving on, we've talked enough about, about sneakers for this episode. Let's get to it. The Met Gala red carpet, it may still be happening right now. I think they were waiting for Rihanna, but we signed off at some point because I honestly could not take it anymore. I could not look at another floral applique. What did you think of the evening? Well, we started talking just, just to put a time stamp on it. We started talking just as Cardi B appeared, I think. I think that that was my cut off. I think I saw a photo of Sydney Sweeney coming through, but that was kind of where, where I was left. I guess we are waiting on Rihanna at this point and probably will continue to wait for Rihanna. What I think of tonight, I did not enjoy most of what I saw tonight. I think it was a theme that I think was interpreted two different ways, which made things a little schizophrenic at times where I think some people thought of sleeping as literally sleeping. Oh wait. Okay. Let's first of all, let's break this down for people who have never heard of the Met Gala, but this is a fundraiser for the Costume Institute that Anna Wintour helps put on with the museum. Andrew Bolton is the curator. He's married to Tom Brown. It's all very in the fashion universe. Everybody's kind of in cahoots. So the theme of the exhibition that is at the Costume Institute right now, which I implore all of you to go to, did you go this morning, Jacob? It was, it's stunning. I did not. I did not go. It was too much of a slap for a Monday morning, but I will go. I promise I will go. You have to go. It's really, really good. That was called Sleeping Beauty's Reawakening Fashion. And there's this whole thing where they're, they like reconstructed dresses and stuff. Hey, who cares? The dresses are gorgeous. It is beautiful. It's beautifully done. It was one of the best exhibits they've done in years. I was very impressed. And I also think because the theme was sort of nebulous, it was a pleasant surprise that it looked so good. The theme of the Met Gala, which is the fundraiser for the exhibition, was Garden of Time. Which what does that mean? I don't know what that means either. I know instinctively that that was the theme, but I think that I was looking at a lot of stuff this evening, kind of thinking, what does this fit into anything that's happening? I think, you know, in years past, we've had, I always think about the camp year and how no one seemed to be able to agree on what camp was, but that was kind of fun because camp had many different avenues. This one, it just seemed like people, I don't know, missed or had, you know, kind of very bizarre insular interpretations of it. But anyway, we've talked a lot. We've not yet set a celebrity. Do you think anyone was particularly good or no? Where are they like, who is going to be talked about tomorrow to you? Okay. I thought that Nicole Kidman probably looked the best, which she didn't do any theme. She was wearing Balenciaga inspired by archival Balenciaga. It was like a white bustier with a feather skirt, like a mullet feather skirt type thing. It was gorgeous. The dress was really good. Kendall Jenner in archival. Once again, archival was a very big thing this season because there weren't actually, a lot of the big brands did not buy tables. They only had one or two people or they didn't send anyone where as usually they do. Balenciaga had 10 people. They bought a table, but it was much more one offs. And Kendall was wearing vintage Givenchy designed by Lee McQueen in 1999. It was very good. I thought that she probably, when I really think about it, my personal favorite was Rosalia, who was in Dior. And I liked that for like, that's what I would wear. I thought it was great. It was like a black dress with a peplum, but a chic peplum, not a dowdy one. I thought that looked good. I thought the Loewe people all looked great, Greta and Io and Taylor. The interesting thing about the Rosalia thing is that she is now working with this stylist Lorenzo Passano, who used to be with Dua Lipa. And now Dua Lipa is now a Jaleel Weaver who is Rihanna's stylist as well. There's like a lot of switcheroo's happening in the musician stylist world. And Dua Lipa was wearing Marc Jacobs. I thought she looked good and she was wearing a Laya last night and also looked good in that. And then we can talk about the Margiela artisanal crew in a second, but who did you think looked good? I also quite liked Rosalia. I liked Taylor Russell as well. I thought it was very statuesque and quite, you know, striking. And that dress Taylor Russell's Loewe dress was like made out of wood. Yeah, it was very like, it kind of caught the light really interestingly too. I quite liked that. And then I liked Charlie XCX and Marnie, which was a t-shirt like it was made from old t-shirts. I thought was a nice kind of story that she could actually say something when she was being interviewed, which a lot of times these celebrities are just completely flailing. I did not like, I liked the Loewe women for the most part. I thought the men did all looked quite bad. I think they did a real disservice to Joshua Connor who is. Wait, I think he looks funny. I just saw it. Oh, it's awful. No, it's awful. It's it didn't have like, Luca Guadadini was wearing something similar and he leaned in with the sunglasses and it had more of a texture to it and it had more of a wall factor, I think that worked. Whereas Joshua Connor is supposed to be, I think a little bit more put together to me. Like the hair was kind of wacky and it just looked wrong the way it hit the carpet with the tentacles from the tailcoat. No, it did not work to me. So let's just describe this for people. Joshua Connor, we love him. He's the best star of challengers and that other movie that I was told not to go see because I'll fall asleep. What's it called? I'm sure you've seen it. I've not seen it. It's an Italian movie. I need to go see it. He was wearing like an extended, it was from the runway or at least was based upon the, I think the last Loewe runway show or maybe the one before that. It was like an extended tailcoat kind of extended waistcoat that looks like he's wearing like floppy bunny ears or something. Thank you. Thank you. It was inverted bunny ears or some kind of dragging confetti strips, but it just didn't work to me. And Jamie Dornan was wearing something similar, like a similar kind of waistcoat situation. This is not a good look. This just doesn't work in this era of clothing. It's too strange to the eyes and any effect to bring it back. Like sometimes designers do this. I think Tom Brown has done some waistcoat stuff, some tailcoat stuff in the past and it just doesn't work. This kind of extended tailcoat or waistcoat thing, but that's to me. I don't know. I think I obviously have a male bias of what I looked at. Did you have you seen Will Welch and Evan Kenori? Yeah, I'd love to understand how Will broke it to advertisers that he was going to be wearing. Evan Kenori, who for the listeners that don't know is a like incredibly, incredibly small brand out of San Francisco run by a beloved former skateboarder. Oh God, Evan would take Umbridge and be calling him just a former skateboarder. A very talented guy who taught himself to sew on his own and now runs this very, very small brand out of San Francisco that is effectively like an American Paul Harnedon in a way, I would say. Another reference your listeners are not going to get, but yeah. No, they definitely won't. And they do sell it at Dover Street Market apparently. But it's basically the only people who wear this are guys who work at GQ or are associated with GQ. Although Sam Hine, who is sort of the leading style Maven at GQ, he doesn't seem like an Evan Kenori guy, but all the other guys wear it. I find it very funny and also charming that Will went to great lengths to have Evan Kenori where it designed his outfit. But you know what it kind of reminds me of? Remember when Jim Nelson and Jim Moore were like, we are going to define great American style. We're going to make Todd Snyder famous. We're going to make all these people famous. I feel like all those guys are kind of trying to do that for Bode and Evan Kenori and whoever else know is going to profile for the next issue. But it's interesting because it's just so much more niche now because niche is the new mass and all that stuff. I think it embodied what I think we saw from a lot of men tonight, which was them looking radically different in a way. Will looked very not his normal vibe. Adrian Brody with the blonde hair, Jeremy Strong with the dangly earring. I think GQ as a publication has been about defining the new masculinity. Are these men that are pushing toward their middle age? I'm very curious about these transformative looks and them debuting them. I can't draw any conclusion from it, but there were some very interesting choices there tonight from the men. But yes. So let's talk about another guy, Tom Ford, who did not wear Tom Ford. Tom Ford retired from his brand about a year and a half ago. He lives in Florida. He has nothing to do with his brand. He cashed out. He sold it to Estee Lauder. Zenia produces it. His longtime right hand, Peter Hawking is now the designer of Tom Ford. Tom Ford shows up to the Met Gala in a brown velvet suit by Anthony Vagarello for Saint Laurent, who is a big, a lot of designers wear his Saint Laurent. Mark Jacobs also wears it quite a bit. I don't know if he was wearing it tonight, but what do you think of that? What did you think of the look and also what do you think of him not wearing his own brand that is designed by someone he worked with for more than 20 years or whatever? Well, at first glance, when he stepped onto the TV, I thought, okay, he's wearing Tom Ford. It looked very Tom Ford-y into me, especially because earlier in the night, we'd seen Donald Glover wearing Saint Laurent, wearing like the kind of traditional look that Saint Laurent is pushing right now, which is this giant fluid suit. That was not what Tom Ford himself was wearing. And he, they ask, what are you wearing? And I expect him to say, oh, Tom Ford. And he says, you know, Saint Laurent by Anthony Vagarello says it by name. And it felt incredibly pointed to me at least as a viewer. I mean, maybe I'm reading too much into it. But again, to cite GQ, there was that interview that Will did with him not too long ago, where he spoke openly about that he didn't like what was going on at Tom Ford. I mean, do you remember this, correct, Lauren? Honestly, I don't remember that part of it. I feel like if I saw that, I would have pulled it out and been like, I have, I have heard that, that he, he isn't loving it, but that's, that's hearsay for sure. I am, I've not spoken to Tom Ford about it. Yeah. He, he got upset. Now I remember he got upset actually, because Peter Hawking's had said something to GQ about that he was given a blank page to start Tom Ford menswear. And then Tom kind of spins out how upset he was by this, in this interview. And I had always found it, I mean, it's very rare in this day and age to read one designer kind of saying something about another in a publication, let alone your, the person that followed you in that role, your successor, you're kind of kneecapping them pretty quickly in the pages of GQ. That feels like very much from a different era maybe. And so I did, I mean, again, maybe I'm reading too much into it, but it did feel a little, what's going on here that he was willing to say so openly that he was, and proudly that he was not wearing the brand that carries his name. Yeah. It's interesting because he definitely left on his own accord. Like that. It wasn't like he was pushed out. He wanted to leave. And also Peter was his deputy and was head of menswear for decades. And I personally think the the new Tom Ford, it feels very standardized, but in some ways, especially the women's, it is much more, this is a dreaded word, but wearable. So I would say when customers are looking, I want a cute dress, they could buy a Tom Ford dress. Whereas before the stuff was, I always end up calling it weird, but it wasn't weird. It was, it was a little eccentric is the word. And interesting, but eccentric, especially compared to what he did at Gucci and Saint Laurent when he, when he was designing those brands, which was so, those kind of set the tone for commerciality in that era. And so it's just interesting to me that he, that he's bothering because he's not a, he doesn't seem like a publicly petty person. He seems like a person that wants to be classy and, and you know, he wants to push the envelope, but always, he was married to a journalist. Like he knows how to say a lot without going too far and to give the the media something, he's very media trained. So it was a little surprising, but also he looked great. And it's an interesting idea of Anthony Vacorello being a designer's designer or what have you, because it's not something I think about with him much at all actually, but he is, I mean, he's a, he's a customer's designer and that his stuff is the stuff that hits stores is easy to buy in and everything. So I guess it makes sense, but it's just interesting. Mark Jacobs had an amazing pair of his loafers on, or I don't even know if they were loafers, they were like these thin shoes and I DM the Mark Jacobs comms person and said, what are they? And someone, either he wrote back to me or someone got back to me and they were sailing around Mets. I was surprised. I thought they were women's because they were so delicate. Mark Jacobs, the consummate shopper, he could find anything. But I want to ask at the, at the risk of reading too much into something else, like a lot of Margiela tonight, this is Anna Wintour's party. Are you taking anything from that? Well, you know, Chantal, our friend and Chantal Fernandez, our friend, my former colleague and co-writer of my book. She just did this big piece at the cut at New York magazine about sort of the state of the Met Gala and the Costume Institute. And there was this anecdote in there that they really, Anna Wintour and Andrew Bolton really wanted to do a Galeana exhibit as part of his rehabilitation tour and the Met really pushed back on it. And so they switched to this sleeping beauty's garden of time stuff. And I don't know how quickly that all happened or how close, closely to the time when they decided what the theme would be, it happened. But do I think that setting them up by all these people wearing the Margiela artisanal collection to do some sort of Galeana exhibit in the future? Sure. I also think that collection was essentially designed for red carpet or for formal events. And so what I do know is that those looks were taken the day after the show for the Met. So it was like a very specific thing. I don't think any of that stuff. If you look at it, we should kind of go through who wore the Margiela artisanal Margiela's own by OTB, Renzo Rossos, Italian group. Gian Galeana has been the designer there since 2014. But he did this collection in January that was, Koutour, it really looked like Old Dior where he used to work but got fired because he had two anti-semitic rants, etc., etc. You know the story. But the point being that there were four looks from that collection that I saw. Gwendolyn Christie, this woman, this British investor named, let me look her up, that someone described to me as bankrolling the majority of the British fashion industry, which I think is definitely not true. But she's a British investor and she lives there and her name is Natasha Punawala. She was wearing it as well. That's two. Then there is Zendaya who was wearing it. And then the final person was Kim Kardashian, which I had heard. Bad Bunny too. Oh, bad. Okay, Bad Bunny. So that's fine. Bad Bunny was also Margiela. So there was probably more than that. Several of the co-chairs were there in Margiela, which speaks to perhaps what you're saying or speaks to just kind of a pointed statement about it. And I think you can read however, I think people are going to read into it. I think there's no way they're not going to read into it. Like, you know, this is a huge talking point. The reporting indicates that Anna is kind of in Galliano's corner right now and is pushing some level of a rehab campaign and perhaps pushing him toward another job. But for today, huge win for Renzo Rosso, who keeps reaping the benefits of this once again, like, you know, this, this continued Margiela surge on the back of what Galliano is doing right now at that brand is really interesting. For sure. But what did you think of how they looked? I thought obviously Gwendolyn Chrissy looked great. She wore it in the, in the show. But I'm like, it was told, it just didn't work. For me, it just didn't work. Like I think that there's a level of, it kind of in a way proved to me the way that I felt about the show, which was that it was really amazing and it was probably stuck in time. The most amazing for the people in that room that were able to live some fantasy of a runway show from a period that is long gone, the clothes that you can see the craft on in every stitch. And I get that. And yet I, they're, they felt flat for me in that environment. I didn't find them that compelling. And I thought people like Zendaya in particular, didn't look super comfortable in what she was wearing. She didn't feel, didn't look like she felt at home in it. And I mean, bad bunny, like all anyone's going to be able to talk about is that he looked like he was wearing like a dog bed on his head. Like it just didn't, it got a little too much at a certain point. Yeah. I mean, the point of this is often to wear costumes, but it did. He, he, I didn't even realize that's what it was. He just looked silly. I thought Zendaya looked miserable. She looked fully miserable. And I think she should have worn a Liya or she should have worn Vuitton. She has a huge contract with them. I don't, they, they didn't have a, Vuitton didn't have a table. I think they did dress a few people, but I don't know. I didn't, I didn't love what she, she wore. I thought Gwendolyn Christie looked, she's, it makes sense in that, in that con of the context of her, it's fine. The British investor lady, I find, but we got to talk about Kim Kardashian because is she still breathing is a question. Her, there was a vein popping out of this is a person whose face is totally smooth and filled to the exact right amount, which she was on the Vogue live stream talking to her best friend as Lala Anthony said their best friends, if anyone needs to know, vein popping out of her head cause she could barely breathe. Her face was so red. She looked like she was going to fall over. She couldn't walk up the steps. I don't think that that is good. And that's not going to look good in photos. It's going to look weird. And so that, I think it went too far. I also would like to say that I did say that I didn't think she was going to wear it because I did ask her publicist if she was bringing John Galliano and her publicist set told me no. So I just, I conflated that with thinking she was going to wear it, which unfortunately I was wrong on that one. But, but I just, I think you're right that that it outside of, I went to see the showroom after the collection like a few months later during Paris Fashion Week, during the ready to wear. And again, the, in the showroom, the collection looked incredible because it's a, it's like a museum. And so to see those pieces and how they were constructed and, and to see how it all came together was really interesting. And I think you're right that in the context of that night, and also fashion is so desperate for something that isn't about product, that's about just beauty, that if you were in that room in January, when they did, when they showed this collection for the first time, you would have been blown away. But otherwise it doesn't feel connected to the reality of what the world is today. And you could see that on the red carpet was Zendaya's, Zendaya not looking happy and Kim Kardashian almost falling over. Looked beautiful, but you know. Yeah, it's what you just said about how it's going to look in pictures that brought something into focus for me. Cause I did think like the piece itself is incredible. And then I felt the same where when she arrived, I was just kind of like, she very clearly could not breathe and, and very clearly was struggling. And I, I don't know if that will be looked back. I'd be cure. I mean, maybe we'll see in a future episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, how she ultimately felt about it. But yeah, really that one seemed to take it to a level that I wasn't sure was humanly possible. But yeah, it seems that Zendaya, now that I'm just looking at Vogue that she changed again, it seems like she did as, as we're speaking, I'm vacillating between checking if anyone else arrived and checking the next score, or she did change it to something else that probably is also Margiela, I would guess it does look like it is. Yeah. Yeah. So someone can correct us when they listen to this, if that, if we're wrong, but yeah. So we may have been a bit disturbed by that situation, but we will also say that this was a big night for Margiela. It was a big night for Jean Galliano. It was a big night for Renzo Rosso and OTP. It was also a big night for Loewe and Jonathan Anderson. Worst dress for me, Divine Joy Randolph and Gap Denim Couture, which no, they didn't need to do that. Zach Pozen is an incredible, incredible designer of gowns. He should have just made her a gown and not made it out of denim. It's very nice that he wore Banana Republic, Tuxedo, whatever that means. This woman did not need to be put in a denim dress. Any denim gowns, the only person that's allowed to do that is Britney Spears. That's my role. Okay. Okay. The other two that I thought were really not great were Zoe Saldana and Chloe. And honestly, I thought that Chloe collection looked great. I did not think these red carpet looks translated as well. Greta Gerwig looked good, but generally I was not super into it. And then the final worst dress would be Doja Cat in Ventmonts. But for me, the whole thing is like, how is Garam funding any of this? If you know, please call me because I need to get to the bottom of it. Was there anyone who you were just like, no, no, no to? I want to defend that. I thought the Chloe group together looked great. I thought that that was a very strong brand statement, let's say. They were never apart. They were always moving together, which I thought was a very savvy move, especially for a designer who she was doing her first mech. They were insulating her in a way. Garam, where is the documentary? I need the documentary on this man and his life immediately. I find him endlessly fascinating. Have nothing to say about Ventmont's clothes, whatever, like they exist. That's kind of my feeling. The entire Burberry slate, I love Lewis Hamilton. I have very warm feelings about him as an F1 fan. Just bad, Barry Keogan looking like a chimney sweep, inexplicable. My least favorite. That is just tough things happening there from that brand right now. Chris Hemsworth is the co-chair and arrived wearing an outfit that looked like he was going to a beach wedding and seemed very proud of it, seemed completely unsure as to why he was there. I'm unsure as to why he was picked as a co-chair and was not convinced by what he wore or his continued insistence and interviews that he knew nothing about fashion. Okay, great. Then why did you get picked to do this? I'm just going to go ahead and say it. Too much exposed, but this has been done. It's kind of enough. The Rita Ora, the Bianca Sonsori influence is very potent right now, I would say. All of a sudden, I will give one last positive shout out. I think you're going to agree with me. Sophia Coppa looked great. Always. Always. Always. Excellent outfit. Had nothing to do with anything? But sure, go wear a beautiful, I guess, I don't even know what you would call it. Was it Chanel? It looked like it was Chanel. I'm sure it was. I'm sure. It looked great. She looked fantastic. Look at the photo of her. That was pleasing and let's maybe end it there on a high note. But yeah. What I would say, I don't even want to acknowledge that Rita Ora situation or Taika Waititi's brown leather suit. Just terrible, terrible things happening. But the thing about this Met Gala that's interesting is if you have a boring theme or a theme that doesn't make any sense, the clothes are going to be boring and not really make sense. It's not like a traditional gala. There's always a theme. The idea is to dress up and when you do something like camp, like you mentioned before, that's really easy to get into and everybody looks insane, but it's really fun. And so I think when going forward, they just need to be a bit clearer. Again, this exhibition is incredible and I don't think as many people will go to it because that is a weird name that no one's going to understand. And it's just use your editorial sense and make it a little bit clearer, I think is the takeaway from this. And I hope that they all have a great time at all the after parties and that they are able to drink something because I don't think any of them are going to be eating anything because they're all on ozepic. So that is our take on the Met Gala. Jacob, thank you for bantering with me on that. And we will be back with a very, very quick rumor of the week.

HelloAlma.com So I wanted to address this rumor that was quickly denied last week that LVMH, our favorite luxury conglomerate, just kidding, we love them all equally, was going to sell the Mark Jacobs brand, which it has owned since the late 90s and has employed its designer Mark Jacobs for just as long. He was formerly the creative director of Louis Vuitton. He's made LVMH and its chairman, Bernard Arnaud, much, much money over the years. And there was this rumor that was published on Bloomberg, which has very stringent editorial standards, that the company was thinking of selling the Mark Jacobs brand. They published the story and then an LVMH spokesperson reached out to them and said, we strongly deny that this is happening. We're not selling it. My take is that they probably got approached because Mark Jacobs was a really strong brand in the 2000s. They had a mid-price line called Mark by Mark Jacobs that just killed it at department stores. And then they wanted to potentially spin it out of LVMH and take it public in the U.S., like Michael Corris did in 2011 and became a billionaire on paper. And so Bernard Arnaud, on earnings calls, would talk about how Mark Jacobs was going to be this big, big public company in the U.S. And then the department store model sort of fell apart. They tried to reconfigure the business. It fell apart. And it was really halved or it was a third of what it once was. They had a whole revitalization. They got a new CEO. He reorganized it. And the last few years has been doing really well. Mark's happy. He designs his collections. He doesn't have too much economic pressure. He can kind of design what he wants. And then the commercial team takes inspiration from that and has built out these secondary lines, including affordable handbag lines that people love that don't feel so generic and also this line heaven that has been cool with young people that's like very inspired by the Mark Jacobs of the 1990s. So it makes sense that like another company would want to buy it. But I'm curious from your perspective what you thought of it when you heard, especially you work at the Wall Street Journal, which also has very stringent reporting standards and what you thought when Bloomberg published that. You know, it's so hard to kind of try to think through how another publication, you know, approaches the story or how we would have done it differently. I guess I was left thinking like you've had stuff refuted by an LV image flak. Like we've been in those shoes. You know, there is that game of like, it's not true as of like this second. So they're able to say like it's not true. So it's like, you know, if you if you told me in a month that this was true, sure, like anything at this point, I'm kind of thinking like my sentiment is that anything is possible in LV image world. I think that they are constantly in, you know, acquisition mode to an extent, they might also constantly be in shedding mode. Like who's to say the Mark Jacobs brand is just at such an interesting point because the most visible part of it, as you said, is is heaven. That is, you know, clearly where the heat is, I think, commercially as well as with a younger consumer that a lot of people, a lot of brands want right now and they are able to have that. Do I think that I'd be really curious what the brand would actually sell for that would be what I'd be most interested in is like, what would the value of it be these days? Because the value, it can't be that high commercially, I wouldn't think. I mean, what do you think it would be? So when I did a story a couple of years ago and they were getting close to, I think they said almost 500 million and then they were aiming for a billion in sales by 2027. If you want to sell it at a 1.5, it wouldn't the valuation would the multiple wouldn't be that many. So maybe it's like 1.5 or two. So it also who knows, I don't know what the EBITDA is, they are profitable. So it's, I would say it's not going to be more than a billion dollars or two billion dollars or something like that. It wouldn't be and it may not even be that much. It would really depend on what the EBITDA was. They say that they're profitable, but you know, they again, you can be profitable one quarter and not the next. So I'm not sure. I think there are a lot of companies that could afford it and it would be a big name within a lot of other portfolios like a tapestry or something. So if say tapestry bought that or Capri, well Capri probably couldn't buy it, but tapestry bought that instead of doing this merger, that's something I hadn't even thought of, but that actually makes a ton of sense in the price, in the pricing model that they've created for Mark Jacobs and the pricing model, which is much more affordable than a lot of the other LVMH brands, doesn't really fit into LVMH anymore in the same way. I think here's a thing I would say, I don't think if they were going to sell it, they would have said, if they had any intentions of selling it, that they would have said they strongly denied it. I mean, I deal with them every single week. Sometimes they don't respond at all. Sometimes they say no comment. If they say no comment, I usually am, especially when it's something, I know, like I did a story on a real estate acquisition or a real estate bid they won last week and they said no comment because it was exactly right. There are other times when they've said, that's not true, but I know that parts of it were true. It's this trick, this game of like what there's, I don't think if they had any intentions of selling it, that they would have, because they would just make them look really stupid six months from now. That being said, you're totally right and things can change and it does happen to all of us all the time where someone says, well, it wasn't true then, but we had this amazing offer or opportunity, et cetera. But my hunch, because especially the way Bloomberg reporters are really, they're talking to a lot of bankers and bankers love to say, oh, some things for sale. You have a conversation and we did a report a couple of weeks ago that my Puck partner Rachel Sturgats that LVMH was looking at Glossier and it's a similar thing, like how far along is that in the process? I don't think very far, but did they have, they had a meeting? Yes. So it is interesting. I think the big thing for me, doesn't make sense for LVMH to own Mark Jacobs. If you were a consultant and looking at their portfolio and you're looking at what works and how, what works within the portfolio, especially the fashion portfolio, but the greater portfolio, which includes 70 companies, many of them that are not connected to fashion and hospitality or alcohol or whatever, what works and what doesn't, I would argue that Mark Jacobs isn't a clear fit within that portfolio because it isn't their same value proposition as a lot of these other brands. That being said, it's not costing them a ton of money and the public relations disaster that would occur, that could occur if they got rid of Mark Jacobs. It's not like Donna Karen, which was sort of a dead brand already. I mean, it was run into the ground by who that's, whoever wants to say, but when they sold that to G3, it was already kind of like, the brand had lost a lot of its value. Mark Jacobs, the person is still a big part of popular culture and I just think like selling that would not be, that would be not be a good look within the fashion industry itself and that would trickle down to the consumer. I just think it's a tricky, it's a very tricky proposition from a public relations perspective to, to offload that brand in particular. I don't know what you think. You know, like they did, they obviously still work with Rihanna, but they did do away with Rihanna's fashion brand. Like obviously that didn't have as much actual commercial product in the marketplace, but that was a big, a much talked about, a much publicized partnership that they then, you know, downsized and like Fenty is still there. I think to me, my honest feeling is that it wouldn't be that big of a deal publicly. I don't think many people have that. I think they remember Mark Jacobs. I don't know how deeply they're thinking about it. Every time they go into a department store, every time they go to Essence, I don't, I don't think that that is true. At least that's how I feel. But I think that the framework that you just put it into, like that makes perfect sense to me where for LVMH, it's not costing them a lot of money. I don't think that they're probably interested to sell it, but I do think that for the right suitor, it probably could be a real feather in their cap or like a total brand that they can say, look at us, we're amazing. They can get a lot of good press out of that. And if the price is right, then maybe the R&Os do just say like, hey, we'll take a few billion for this, get it off our hands and go with God. That world I could see happening at some point. But if the, as you said, they strongly denied it, they're probably not in a rush to offload it. Yeah. And just a reminder that fashion is an industry based on relationships, like every industry, but fashion is even more so. And the R&O relationship with Mark Jacobs, that is just, I think that that, and who knows what the next generation of kids with the kids and how they would approach something like this, they're going to approach things in, I think, a much more straightforward, commercially driven way, even more so than their father. But that is something he, Mark Jacobs did a lot for that company. And Totally. I just think it's not the right time. Five years from now, maybe, maybe we'll talk. And it will come up again. But I think it just, it just feels like, I don't know if you'd want to go there at this point. I don't know how sentimental that guy is. Can't be that sentimental. Who? Mark Jacobs or Bernard Arnault? Bernard Arnault. Okay. I was going to say, because we watched, I mean, I don't know if you watched, but there was just the, the Mark Jacobs, Pharrell Williams, Louis Vuitton interview that was done by System Magazine. That is a very hard sit, in my opinion, where it's Pharrell just basically talking about how amazing Mark is and Mark visibly uncomfortable, at least to my interpretation, the entire time, being like, buddy, that was a time that happened. Like, I don't really want to have you keep telling me about how amazing that was. But I, you know, clearly though, that would indicate what you're saying of like, they're still, you know, he's still in the universe. He's still in orbit with them. I don't think that this is a partnership that is, you know, separating in any public way right now. Correct. Correct. Jacob, this was so much fun. Do you think we're going to feel like we gave them enough MetGal? If you have more questions for us, you can text us. Most of you have both of our phone numbers or you can DM us. But MetGal coverage is always like this. It's always, people say one thing and anyone reading it wants to offer their opinion in, no matter what we would have said, people would have thought different looks were better or worse looks were better, you know. So if you want to send us a message, send us a message. That's that. Yeah. Sorry to all the people we forgot to talk about. Absolutely. I'll talk to you soon. We'll catch up in a couple weeks. Bye.
