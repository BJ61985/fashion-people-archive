Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Puck's Fashion and Beauty Memo Line Sheet. And today on the show we're talking LVMH, the Olympics, and more with Puck's resident sports expert, John Orrand. Let's get started. Hey everyone, it's Lauren. Before we get going, I wanted to remind you that if you like this podcast, you'll definitely love Puck, where I send an email three times a week called Line Sheet. If you're a fashion person, you get that reference. It's an original look at what's really going on inside the fashion and beauty industries. Line Sheet is scoopy, analytical, and above all fun.

Happy Friday everyone. It was another big week of news and fashion online sheet. Rachel Sturgats, who covers beauty for us, dug into the situation at Tom Ford Beauty, owned by Estee Lauder. Estee Lauder owns the entire Tom Ford brand, but operates the beauty, Zanya operates the fashion. As I said in my column on Monday, the really important thing here is not the firing of Peter Hawking's, the designer at Tom Ford Fashion, but the beauty business and whether or not that's working or not. She really gets into that and you should check it out. Rachel is the leading beauty writer and analyst and reporter, all that stuff, and no one does it like her. But that's just the beginning. There was tons of speculation around the designer moves in Europe. Where is John Galliano on O'Going? Where is Sarah Burton? Is she definitely going to Givenchy? It seems like yes, but again, we don't know until the contract is signed and the release goes out. So we'll see in the next couple of weeks. I hope that one's true. This Galliano to Fendi thing. Look, I think it sounds crazy. I'm incredibly doubtful, but I'm not the one in charge. So let's ask Mr. Arno and Mr. Toledano. Maybe they'll have some answers soon. I also covered this week's earnings, which was like pretty much everyone in luxury from the sort of okay at LVMH to the not so okay at carrying to the they can do no wrong at Hermes. My big thing is that all these changes of the fashion houses are happening because the products aren't selling. Everyone's panicking and everyone I think does need to chill out a bit. It's hard to do that when you're a public company, but these luxury brands are supposed to be taking the long view. So let's see if they start doing that. And again, like everyone's going to be okay. All these brands are going to exist in 15 years. It's just a matter of what form are they going to exist in? And that's what these executives need to figure out right now. I also, for something a little lighter, I don't know, people are pretty emotional about this. So maybe not so late, but I get into Blake Lively's self-directed red carpet styling. She famously does not have a stylist. Anytime I post anything on Instagram about anyone in the Taylor Swift inner circle, people just go bananas. Like I got hundreds of messages about Blake's Deadpool and Wolverine premiere looks. And all I will say is bad taste is better than no taste. And I do have more intel on kind of how Blake operates on the red carpet in line sheet. Today is the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics. So I'm going to fire up the Apple TV. I'm going to subscribe to Paramount Plus. I don't think we're currently subscribed to that one. And see if LVMH got its money's worth. John Orand, who covers the business of sports over here at Puck, has a lot of great intel on this. So I hope you enjoy our conversation. And please send me your picks for best Olympics uniforms. Maybe I'll do a ranking. John Orand, welcome to Fashion People. I don't want to say, Lauren, this is a pinnacle of my career to be on like the country's best fashion podcast. But you know, it's like the country's only fashion podcast. Should I tell you I'm wearing a Johnny O shirt? I don't know what that means. Gap shorts. Which Johnny O? I guess it's more of a golf shirt type of a. It's a sporty shirt. Yeah. J-O-H-N-N-I-E. Yeah. Interesting. So just for the listeners, is it gray or lavender? I can't tell from the, is it like light purple? Yeah, it's light purple. Yeah. So like light purple striped button up polo shirt. It's actually quite nice with a pocket. I like it a lot. Yeah, I'm a big fan of it. I would have maybe thought it was Faraday Brothers or something. Sorry, I'm lost. Do you know that brand? I'm already lost, Lauren. Okay. So gap shirts. So John, the question we actually asked the first question on Friday's show is, what did you have for breakfast? Oh, that's great. I had a banana. That's it? Yeah, that's all. I just had a banana, no protein. I'm a big lunch guy. I'm going to make a sandwich for lunch, but just a banana. Okay. That's interesting. You're the second banana we've had. I'm the top banana, Lauren. Come on. You are the top banana. This is true. So for all of our listeners, John writes an amazing newsletter for, sorry, private email for Puck called the Varsity. And he is essentially, I guess you could say in some ways like the me of sports, or I am the you of sports, or you, can you talk a little bit about what your expertise is in sports and then we'll get into why you're on a fashion podcast? You know, our careers are very similar in different industries because I spent 18 years covering sports media for a trade magazine called Sports Business Journal owned by Advanced Newhouse. So Kandey Nast, who is part of the Puck Cinematic Universe for the Line Sheet, was a sister company. What's up, Roger? And I spent 18 years there covering everything from the rise of ESPN to now the rise of Amazon and Netflix as they try to amass as many sports rights as they can. So it's been a really fun and fascinating business to cover just because it's been changing. So it's changing as much as when it went from radio to television almost. Nobody quite knows. Everybody has an idea where it's going to go. Everything's going towards streaming, of course. But these old line TV networks are still holding on as much as they can, like they are with the Olympics, which we're going to talk about because NBC has the rights to the Olympics going until 2032. So if you're a TV watcher, you're going to be able to see the Olympics well into the next decade. But if you're a streamer, everything's going to be streamed on Peacock. So that's sort of, I'm at the intersection of all of that. How does it work out? Because we have a lot of actually have quite a few international listeners because I cover so many companies out of Milan and Paris. And also obviously this has to do. We're here to talk really about the business of sports and fashion colliding, but also the Olympics in particular and the LVMH sponsorship. Like how does it work outside of the U.S.? Is it the similar deals with stations in France and Germany or wherever people are or China? Can you watch it in China? Sure. They are able to do rights deals in China. And that's one of the things about the streamers that's so interesting is that in the past, before these global streamers started, the International Olympic Committee would have to go market to market to market and try to sell the rights into various markets. But now you have Netflix just bought two Christmas day games. They're going to show the National Football League two games on Christmas day. And just with a flip of a switch, those games are going to be international. You can see them worldwide wherever you can get Netflix, which is global. So it's made it a lot easier for the leagues and for people that own those rights to get their programming in front of international audiences. So now you can not only watch Emily in Paris on Netflix, but you can watch football. American football. American football, yes. Okay, so let's talk about the Olympics. There is now, I did a piece probably six months ago about this and sort of as everyone listening probably knows, LVMH is the lead sponsor of the Paris Olympics. They kind of came in at the last minute. Antoine Arnaud, the oldest son, the second oldest child, Bernard Arnaud, the CEO and chairman of LVMH, one of the richest men in the world, depending on the day, I don't think today the stock is down 14% because of crappy earnings. But anyway, Antoine is sort of a really nice guy, the big person kind of that did the deal with the Olympics. And they were brought in at the last minute because the main sponsor pulled out and they dropped $150 million, which is like chump change for them, but still a lot of money. And they are going to be all over the Olympics. So can we talk a little bit first about how big in your world, you look at all these different sponsorships and how brands interact. I went to my first Dodgers game on Sunday and I was thinking of you just all the big marquees and the digital marquee versus the physical marquee and how much I wonder what they charge for each of those. But how important or how significant can an Olympic sponsorship be for an advertiser? And what is the goal usually in spending this money and putting your name all over the Olympics? So the Olympics are unique. There are only a couple of different sports properties that have a global audience. So here in America, it costs the most to get involved with the National Football League. And then you go through and Super Bowl advertising is over $7 million per 30 second spot. It's huge, but you're only reaching a US audience. With the Olympics, with the FIFA World Cup is another example. These are sort of global brands in the Olympics that dwarfs the FIFA World Cup. So you have big multinational companies like Coke, Toyota, Visa is a big Olympic sponsor, Procter and Gamble for the fashion podcast Omega is also a big sponsor. And this is a way for them to get their message and try to sell their, well, just try to market globally. So LVMH, for example, as I know you know, but I told that they, their French market, their market share in France, I think only like less than 10% of their sales come from, come from France. So they're, this was a very patriotic sort of move for them to step in and, and, and buy this sponsorship because it also helps them get, you know, market their wares in Asia, where, you know, they, they, they have a big market share in the United States where of course they have a huge market share, like a quarter, I think, or something along those lines. And, and so it, for, for big multinational corporations that want to go outside their own borders, these are, these are excellent sponsorships you get. And it also shows like, look, it's Coke, you know, you can't be a mom and pop shop and, and, and be an Olympic sponsor. You can't afford it really. So, so it's also there, there's an ego play involved here as well. For sure. I mean, LVMH and the French government are almost one and the same. They're so enmeshed. And, and so this is, you're totally right. Like the, the French market is a mature market for luxury goods. The way they've seen the growth in the last few years is actually the U.S., which has now slowed down, but during COVID was suddenly booming again. And, and also obviously Asia, where they are also really challenged right now. The question from, I think, a lot of fashion people is who goes to the Olympics? Because for me, the only people I know who are going are like really wealthy people who like want to hang out in Paris during this time and like can afford to get a really nice hotel and not worry about the fact that you're not going to be able to drive around anywhere. Or I don't know, I, when I go to Paris, I take the metro everywhere and walk. Anyone who takes cabs in Paris all the time is crazy. But, but like, when I was there for in June with Liz Goff, one of Pucks co-founders to do some meetings, and also I went to some shows and things, so it was men's and couture fashion week. Like it was just the traffic was crazy and everyone was just complaining. Everyone who lives in Paris is leaving. But like who goes to the Olympics? Who do you think is going? Because this is different than if it was in, I don't know, like a small town in Europe or something like or Atlanta or wherever. Or like this is to go to Paris. That's like an added layer of excitement, but also stress. Like what's the profile of the person who attends these games? I think that you identified it at the beginning of that question. It's like really sort of a rich, well connected person. In order to prepare for this pod, I talked to a former colleague in my terry left and he does, he's like the original sports business reporter who covers sports sponsorships for SBJ. And he was talking about how sponsorships have changed over the years. But one thing that hasn't changed is the fact that if you're going to sponsor the Olympics, one of the big perks that they get is just a boatload of tickets so that you then bring your biggest customers over and you give them tickets, you give them a VIP service, and they're able to go and watch. I've covered one Olympics and that was the London Olympics in 2012. Which London, another big European city just like Paris. And I lived in London in the late 90s and so I was prepared for it to be chaos and just jam-packed. And the funny thing is everybody that lives in London left London. It was London at its most glorious. I don't think I ran into a Brit the entire time there because it was just empty. So the people that are attending aren't the locals that are going. It's generally well-heeled people that are connected to some of these sponsors. Which also, this is I know publishing on Friday this podcast, which is going to coincide with the opening ceremony. And I think that the Paris Olympics are doing something really unique with the opening ceremony where all the athletes are going to come down the river Sen. And so that's a way to make it sort of more egalitarian. You're going to have people that can come out and actually see this instead of having the opening ceremony be a really hot ticket that's within an arena or a stadium. Yeah, I guess. And Paris is so small, like you'll be able to walk. Most people will be able to walk to it, which is nice. LVMH did a press conference last week. Antoine Arnaud spoke at length. And it was interesting. I mean, he said, he's like, this is really risky for us. If something happens, that's a four and a half hour ceremony that is essentially going to also be an advertisement for LVMH. So one question I have for you is like, so they're doing everything. They're doing the trays. Louis Vuitton is doing the trays that the medals come out on. A lot of Berluti's doing the uniforms for the opening ceremony. That I think was a weird choice. I think they should have done Dior. It's a French brand, but whatever. It's not my job. I'm going to agree with you on that completely. Antoine used to be the CEO of Berluti. Y'all, that wasn't right. But anyway, the point being that it's going to be this four and a half hour advertisement, LVMH is going to be ever... The thing is, LVMH is like Procter & Gamble. It's a parent company. So it has a brand, but it's really not the brand. And I think what is the goal of this for them may be to become like a P&G where everyone in the world has heard of LVMH. A lot of people I talk to, if I talk to someone who works outside of the fashion industry for a story, a lot of times they just refer to it as Louis Vuitton. And I'm like, no, that's only $20 billion of their $1 billion in sales. But is it common for it to be this much stuff? All these little ways that they're branding it, all these opportunities. And also, they already own so much or rent so much of the advertising space in Paris that a lot of the brands just decided we're not even going to do outdoor advertising during this period. It's just all LVMH all the time. Have you ever seen anything to this extent with any sort of sports sponsorship? Probably not to the extent of the number of brands that they have and also the aspirational brands that are out there. Generally, they those stay away from strict sports sponsorships. But when he talked about the riskiness of Paris, part of what he was saying was true. I mean, I've been told they did not want to be a sponsor for this, even though they were instrumental in helping to bring the Olympics to Paris, they did not want to be a part of it. And so because of that, they were able to extract a ton of concessions I'm told from the IOC, including the tax deductions. One of the main concessions that the IOC gave them was the right to activate internationally, which is precedent setting. Because typically sponsors that did IOC deals would have to do separate deals with every country that they wanted to get into. And then they're able to sell shirts or whatever wears with the Olympic logo. But the IOC in order to get LVMH in, sort of said, you can just do it globally wherever you want to do it. And that was a really big... So when he says it's risky, yeah, I guess it's risky because something could happen or who knows what's going to happen over the next two weeks. But it was an incredible business deal that LVMH was able to cut that is frankly better than anything any of the other sponsors have been able to work out. So the way he was talking, it just sounds very French, which is they always bring up the like bad thing first. So anytime anything's going on, you sit down with a French person, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, life is horrible. And then you have the real conversation, which to be honest, is kind of nice. I like in LA, no one says anything negative ever. It's completely... And I like in Paris where it's completely out on the table. I don't like the middle, like more passive aggressive stuff. So I'm a fan. But that is, to me, that's like a... They always want to like hedge it with this is a bad situation. So that in the end, if it turns out well, they're fine. But the IOC, you're talking about the International Olympics Committee and they kind of manage all these sponsorships and things. That is so interesting about... I haven't... I actually haven't seen a lot of branded merch or any branded merch around LVMH brands. I'm sure there will be. But question for you, like how strict is the IOC? Because I've actually gotten some emails from people about different brands that are doing sort of Olympics adjacent products. And oh, this seems like this is out of the IOC's regulation. This wouldn't be allowed. How do they regulate it? Can they really do anything if someone could... Do they sue people if they feel like they've overstepped? What is the deal with the IOC's control over how much brands can use the Olympics in their merchandise? The brands cannot use the Olympic rings. I mean, so that's what you're buying is associated... association with the Olympic rings. No matter where you go, you have ambush type of advertising, ambush type of marketing that plays a part of it. I just was in North Texas, in Arlington, Texas, for the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. One of Major League Baseball's oldest sponsors is Gatorade. Well, just this year, they signed a water sponsorship with Blue Triton. And so at the game, it was all Blue Triton, except for this... What is Blue Triton? Is it just like a water brand? It's like a water, bottled water. At the game and around the game, Gatorade, instead of pushing, it's... I want to call it a juice. I'm not sure what Gatorade is, but instead of pushing, it's a regular drink. It's sugar, John. It's pure sugar and you shouldn't drink it. It's electrolytes. Don't drink it, people. It helps your performance, I'm told, Lauren. Yeah, you can drink some drink water. Natural... Oh, okay. So Blue Triton owns Pull and Spring, Arrowhead. These are the ones we... I would know. Pure life, I've actually heard of Deer Park, but I'm a big Pull and Spring drinker anyway. It's a big deal for baseball. They signed a water sponsorship. Well, at the All-Star Game, Gatorade decided, oh, we want to push water. And so they were pushing water. And it ended up being a... That hasn't been resolved yet, but that was almost sort of like an ambush marketing attempt by an actual partner of theirs. And you always see... You're going to see in Paris, people that are not IOC partners or even Paris 2024 partners that are trying to set up pop-up shops or set up different things around the Olympic Village. But the IOC is able to control who gets into the Olympic Village, what sponsors get there, what signage is around there. And most importantly to them, who gets to be associated with the rings.

Moving more broadly into fashion's relationship to sports, to me, it goes back to, and it's obviously goes back to Rene LaCoste, but it really like the modern sports partnership thing goes back to Jordan and the incredible business that Nike has around that. That it could be, I mean, that's its own company. It could be, I think they've thought of spinning it off into its own business before, but what do you see like today? Every week, there's more and more, especially like European football. Soccer has become a really big thing with fashion. When I was at the men's shows in Paris, there were so many American football players there. I had to ask you all, the pucks lack, like, who are these people? Do they matter? I got a press release from this one football player who I'd never heard of and who was at every single show and was like, he wants to get more into fashion. But anyway, like if you're in sports, the fashion brands want you. It's just completely like, to me, it goes Rene LaCoste created a fashion brand, then Jordan creates a fashion brand, then you look like America's Cup, Prada started to really get into the America's Cup in the around 2000 and now, and then Louis Vuitton did it and they went out, but now they're back in, but it's everywhere. Like every soccer player, every WNBA player, every whatever, they all have fashion deals or they are into fashion or obviously the NBA walk when everybody's wearing their Tom Brown or whatever. Like as someone who writes about the sponsorships and just sees how they're connected to the media of it all, like what do you see as the evolution? Have you noticed a change in the past few years of how much like the broader sports world is interacting with the fashion world? No, absolutely. And I think that goes with the changes that we've seen in how sponsors are approaching sports. So back in the day, sponsors were mostly interested in getting the tickets that we talked about and getting signage. And I think back in, way back in like 1984, I believe it was like McDonald's like sponsored like the Diving Well during the Olympic Dives and the IOC ended up thinking that was too cheap looking. So they didn't like to do that. But that was essentially for decades how people wanted to do sponsorships. We want to get our brand out there and we want to be able to get enough VIP tickets to get our best clients handled. The sponsorship of the 2024 in Paris is it still has signage and it still has tickets, of course, but it's so much more involved with content and it's so much more involved with social media. And in order to do that, like these are players that are off the field. And so fashion plays a huge part of that. So when you say that if you're in sports fashion wants you, if you're in fashion, the sports stars definitely want to be a part of that because it's sort of like a really cool brand extension for them to get in front of audiences that aren't going to be watching the National Football League on Sunday afternoons. And so like, I think you're certainly going to see more of that as these marketing efforts get just more tailored to personal individual athletes, even more so than, you know, the Jordan Nike of the 1990s. Has the unbundling of television and the cable cord cutting, I know I'm very good friends of Amanda Dobbins and she's always who works at the ringer. She's always talking about she loves puck and she reads your column about the fact that you can't watch the Dodgers in LA if there's something that you've written. I don't, I don't really understand, but like it's really hard to watch all these shows. Like it feels like you have to, if you want to watch every sport and you want to watch every like anything, you have to subscribe to 15 different services or whatever. I don't know if that's actually the case. We don't subscribe to any. Well, I actually don't, I don't know if we do. We might have some baseball. I bet you do. I bet you do. But a point being that like it's so fractured. Like, do you think that also has, has affected this where the audiences or the audiences for these different sports smaller than they used to be, they must be a lot for live viewing. But do you think that that's affected the like reliance on these sponsorships and the interest in this more like customized partnership type thing? Absolutely. And I think one of the, one of the problems that TV networks face is that you'd be surprised that when you take a look at the numbers of people that are watching live sports in the States, they're not dropping even though people are shedding their, their cable subscriptions. But one of the big problems is that the age of the person watching sports is growing exponentially. So like when I, when I graduated from college, I ordered cable, I think before I ordered heat or telephone or anything else in, in, in my building, because it was cool at the time. Of course you're going to get cable. My, my son and my daughters, zero chance they're, they're subscribing to that. So, so as they even know what cable is is a question. Well, of course, you know, what cable is they, they're my, they're my kids. But that's true. That's true. But maybe their friends don't. Yeah, their friends definitely don't. But the, so these younger, these younger generations, they don't need to see every game. They don't need to see all of the game. They just need to see the highlights that are coming through. And so how do, how do athletes, how do, how do teams and how do leagues put themselves in front of those, in front of those younger audiences, which are the audiences that the advertisers want. And so that's, that, that's how the, that's how fashion is able to creep, creep into more and more, some of these athletes, because the quick one minute TikTok video is going to hit more people than, you know, probably a 10 yard run around the right end for, for, for Kansas City, Chave. Yeah. So one other question on the LVMH thing, one thing that has sort of come up is there aren't that many fashion brands that have a natural, that have like a very natural relationship with sports. So like the two that come to mind are Ralph Lauren, which has done the U S outfits forever. They, you polo obviously is part of it, but also, there's just swimming, there's just tennis. There's all these ways they can connect. And then there is, so that's on the, I'm talking about on the high end of fashion, Nike is obviously a big one, but that's, that sport related directly. And then the other one is Hermès with horse jumping. Obviously Hermès will be present in these games. It's French. There's horse stuff. They sponsor athletes, et cetera. Other than that, it feels like the rest of the fashion world has been really boxed out of this, this Olympics games because of LVMH is home court advantage, plus putting all this money in, plus already, like I was saying, they already rent most of the outdoor space for advertising anyway. And then the other part of this that is interesting, I'm interested to see what ends up happening is a lot of roads are going to be blocked off. So some stores are just planning on not even being open. So this idea that like, I'm sure that Paris is going to make a lot of money during this period, but in other ways, the, the tourism will actually be reduced because there's not going to be people shopping in stores during this time, because they're not going to be open because they can't even get the product. One, one brand person was telling me they can't even physically deliver the product to their stores during that time. So have you ever witnessed something like this where the sponsor sort of boxes out everyone involved and has such a monopoly over, over an event? Like it, it feels like to me, I can't think of something that, that is equivalent because of the fact that it's not like if PNG sponsored it, who cares if everybody has a razor from PNG, like no one, it's not like they are going to have control over the whole messaging and everything, but it feels like this, this from my end is just another example of LVMH really owning the luxury business in a way that they have always sort of at least for the last 20 years, but now really do. But is there anything equivalent that you've ever seen? Well, like how many of those other companies that you mentioned could be able to afford a hundred, a hundred and fifty, hundred, sixty million dollars in order to sponsor? I mean, there are only so many companies that, that are in that position and LVM, LVMH is certainly one of them, right? Yeah, yeah. It's a, I think that right now they're probably the only one. Yeah. And then so, you know, the way that, the way the leagues are then IOC sell sponsorships is the way that they're able to get that hundred, fifty, hundred, sixty million out of LVMH is the parm of some exclusivity. So you do see a lot of this, but I think that ultimately, if you look at the brands that are the biggest sponsors of the Olympics and biggest ones with the International Olympic Committee, there are all these multinational brands that are able to afford this. And I think that's, that's more of what you're seeing than sort of anything else. I also don't necessarily view this as a sports sponsorship for LVMH. I think it's, I mean, the whole French flavor that's going to come out over the next two and a half weeks is, is part of what they're pushing. I mean, I said, I use a word patriotic earlier. I, I really get the sense that that's what this is. And I would be really surprised if they came and had any kind of like Olympic sponsorship four years from now in Los Angeles. Well, it's interesting because it's a good point. And there was a piece in the Times covering the, from there, not a fashion reporter from their Paris based reporter, and they brought up LA and he said, let's see how this goes. So they're not, they're not ruling it out. I mean, the one thing about LVMH in Los Angeles is the connection to Hollywood is so great. Like they obviously were talking about these sponsorships with athletes, the red carpet is a big part of their marketing at this point. And also they went into partnership with a, I don't know if it's a film studio. I think it is a studio. The guys behind are really interesting, but they're basically producing TV movies, all that stuff themselves now, instead of buying CAA like Francois Henri Pinot did, not through caring, but through his family office. They decided to launch this little studio, Celeron, which is also owned by caring, just launched a film studio. So like the connection with fashion and Hollywood is really great. So I could see them throwing in 20 million, maybe not 150, but yeah, it's, I, I mean, you're right. It's, it's very much like if they want the government to be nice to them and let them do all the things that they let them do right now, they got to keep, I mean, they got really lucky with, with what's with the election. And even though it's a little chaotic, they're, they're in a good place. But someone was saying to me that like, even if Le Pen had been elected, like it's in everybody's best interest to be nice to LVMH. So think about Paris is it's very much a company town. Like it's like DC or, or LA in that way. It's the world revolves around fashion. So in some ways there was not really another choice or L'Oreal would have been a good one too, I guess, and probably could have afforded it. But I don't think they would have gotten as much juice out of it as, as LVMH is going to. Yeah, it's a short list. And remember, there's, there's so much more involved that they have to spend than the 160. I mean, yeah, so before I did the, the, the, the the relay, then they just had a lot of marketing in the lead up to the games during the games and certainly coming out of the game. So like the, the, you know, 150, 160 million that we keep quoting is going to, is a drop in the bucket compared to everything that they're going to put into this.

Like the, what if, what if, what if we should call it actually? The gold medal? No, no, no. Like what is the event that you're most excited about? But what, what do you call it? An event, an event or a sport. Yeah. Yeah. Which one are you most excited about to see? Like what do you love watching for the Olympics? I'm going to be very parochial here because I grew up in DC. I'm from DC. And in suburban Maryland, just outside of DC, Katie Ledecky, the most decorated women's swimmer of all time is going to be competing in what is probably going to be her final Olympics. And so I'm, I'm interested in that. And I'm, I also love basketball. So I can't wait, I can't wait to see USA basketball play. Yeah, me too. I thought you were, when you said you were from suburban Maryland, I thought you were going to say La Crosse, which is, just so you know, John, La Crosse is trending right now. It's big enough. It's big in LA now. It's starting to grow. Is it big in LA? I have no idea. I don't know if it's big. I know people that have their kids on La Crosse. La Crosse is, but in fashion, it's like very cool right now. Oh, really? That's probably the demo. It's sort of an upper crusty demo that plays La Crosse. Yeah. So there are the, there's this new like La Crosse shorts brand that I've, I've like almost bought a pair of five times. I did play La Crosse in high school. So I feel like I have the right, but yeah, it's like aesthetically the thing right now, which is extremely, it relaxes La Crosse is the brand. They've done like collaborations with cutesy girl fashion brands, but it's like a real thing right now. So I thought you were going to say, because La Crosse is, is summer Olympics, right? Or is it? Is it? You know what? I'm not sure if they're in the Olympics or not. I need, I should double check that. I don't think they are for some reason. La Crosse is the soccer of this generation, John. I think we got like flag football in there and surfing is in there. There are a couple of unique sports that are part of the summer games. It's really fun. Well, unfortunately for me, I'm definitely going to have to watch the four hour opening ceremony or at least have it on in the background because there's going to be too much, too many little Easter eggs in there for me. But this was really fun. Thanks for coming on. This was a hoot. I am so happy to be on this pod. Osempic didn't come up once. It was tough, John. I mean, they should have sponsored it. I don't think any of the athletes need Osempic though, do they? It's true. It's true. Actually, I have a friend who's like really into working out who said he's thinking about going on one of those drugs to like look more cut. He's like very muscular, but he was like, yeah, I might just go on for some maintenance. So I look more cut all the time. I was like, wow. So steroids then. That's great. It's very funny. But this was very fun. I have to tell you, I have this t-shirt from this brand that I have a feeling you've never heard of called Sporty and Rich. Do you know this brand? No. No. Okay. So and the t-shirt just says sports across it. And I've been this close to buying you one like many times. That'd be great. But I was like, I might do it. I'm going to talk to them. Puck has a weekly all hands meeting. I'll show up wearing that. Yeah. Okay. I'm going to send you one or you can wear it to the third birthday party. That's right. It's not fancy enough. But thank you again, John. It was such a pleasure. And you should come on again soon. Hopefully there will be some big fashion sports deal that we can talk about. I'll count on it. Anytime you ask, I'm going to be on. Thank you. Thanks again. This was so fun. Fashion People is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck, hosted by Lauren Sherman. That's me.
