Hello and welcome back to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Puck's fashion and beauty memo line sheet. And today with me on the show, my bud, Jacob Gallagher fills us in on what's happening at Men's Fashion Week in Milan and beyond. We also get into the Alessandro Valentino debut and of course there's a rumor of the week. Let's get started. Happy Tuesday everyone. I am Dyling and from Oslo where I'm on a little family break. As mentioned, we're here for a few days and then off to Paris for meetings and such, plus a few shows and then off to Milan. And yes, I am going to the Dries show on Saturday. As mentioned, there is a dinner. There's a show, there's a party. It's going to be very lovely. Everyone is excited. I'm sure everyone will be in head to toe Dries. I feel lucky that I will be in town for it. I woke up on Monday morning to this Alessandro drop. 173 ready to wear images, 93 close ups. Jacob and I get into it in the episode. So don't miss that. I just want to give you a heads up on a few things in Monday's line sheet. There is a readout from the Jane magazine reunion that happened last week in New York, which sounded very fun. Once again, super jealous. I didn't get to work at Jane, but I am happy that I know a lot of people who did and have worked with a lot of people who did. It was a special place. So if you are a legacy media fiend, don't miss that. Remember fashion people get a discount, puked on news slash fashion people. And if you sign up via that, you'll get a little markdown on our already affordable subscriptions. And then the big thing on Monday was I did a Q&A with the Reformation CEO, Halle Borenstein. I wanted to talk to her. What happens when you get bought by Private Equity, which Reformation did in 2019 by Primera, which has a long history in fashion, actually. They were the owners of Valentino for a while. They owned Hugo Boss. They owned Doc Martens. They made a good amount of money on, I think, all three of those. So good for them. They have a better track record than most Private Equity firms in fashion. And Reformation is interesting. I mean, usually these things happen and then the brand sort of sputters out very rarely. Does it keep moving? And everything I hear in the market is that Reformation is doing super well. And I was interested in discussing that with Halle. She became the CEO in 2020 sort of unexpectedly, sort of not. And she's done a really good job with it. It's just when you hear it from people not involved with the brand that the brand is working, that's when you know there's a real story there. So I had a great time chatting with her. I will be back on Friday. And until then, please send me voice memos. Please send me texts. I am half working, half not, but always available for a scoop. So let me know if you have anything. And otherwise, I'll talk to you when I'm in Paris. Let's get started with Jacob. Jacob, welcome back to Fashion People. Happy to be here. How's it going in Milan? Are you still in Milan or are you in Paris now? I'm in Milan. You caught me midway through packing. I leave tonight to go to Paris. OK, so we are, this is Monday, even though this is going to air on Tuesday. What shows do you have today? Today, Giorgio Armani in about two hours. Then there is, of course, Gucci and the last show is Zegna. So it's a pretty brief day, which speaks to kind of how Milan has been show wise. But yeah, it's an easy exit, I would say. Big day. So we're going to get into this Alessandro drop of insanity. I mean, it's my quick review is everything you expected. But I'd say pleasant surprise in that it looks it looks really pretty. But I guess let's just get into it now. We can go back to the men's stuff, but this this is more important. What did you so so, as I mentioned in the intro, one hundred seventy one ready to look 93 images of shoes, bags, various accessories, according to Vogue runway, which which has the detail images up right now, and you can see pretty much everything. I'm sure the images will be all over the Internet by the time we publish this. But what's your initial reaction to these looks? Well, last night I was talking with a friend and they said, well, certainly he won't just do Gucci again. And I think, you know, at least to the layman, this is certainly going to look like Gucci again. It, you know, I think at least the the DNA and the the codes that he's playing with, they're they're the same. And, you know, all I kept thinking as I made it, I think I'm like 70 way. Seventy looks through this one hundred seventy one. The look monstrosity is maybe not much. Let's say behemoth. God, monstrosity, you know, might might be too judgmental on this. But, you know, I think, you know, the term that kept coming to mind was, unfortunately, Wes Andersonian. I think we're now going to start reading Wes Andersonian again and again. And, and, and, you know, this Victorian and, you know, this interplay of gender and granny clothes. I felt like I was having a little bit of flashbacks to kind of reading the criticism of those first few Gucci collections. But that's what he does best. Certainly to put on my commercial reporter hat for one second. One hundred seventy one looks a lookbook that is bigger than half of that. Like, you know, what was it? Ninety three images of accessories and bags. Hello. Here's a clear sign of what the, you know, business focus is in a certain way. If you dedicate a secondary lookbook to accessories like that, I think you're clearly articulating that, hey, this is what we need to sell. But the clothes are, you know, certainly a feast for the eyes to use another cliched term, let's say. And, and I look for early for us. That's OK. I look forward to getting through it through the rest of them here. You know, and again, I can only imagine this is now going to be the talk of the rest of the day and into Paris. Yeah. I mean, good for him. Monday more. I knew there was going to be something, you know, and technically on vacation. Some I'm taking a real vacation in August, so don't know big deals in August. But look, like I agree. I but I also see it is exactly what I expected, which he references. Forties a lot. He references seventies a lot. I knew he would go into the Valentino Archives. Seventies. I actually own like a good amount of Valentino vintage and I see a lot of Valentino here. It's kind of like heady when he went to Saint Laurent and everyone was like, it doesn't look like Saint Laurent, but there was actually tons of Saint Laurent in there. It's a similar thing of there is a lot of Valentino in here. And especially I see it in the in the dresses. It's kind of weird that I own Valentino vintage. It's not really my it doesn't feel like me, but I do. But the thing I would say, I mean, in the in the dresses, the shape of the jackets, like the the shape of the clothing is. OK, now it's all up on Vogue runway, by the way, if you need to need to go. The shape of the clothing, like the the silhouettes, the colors, the things it does feel it feels more Valentino than I think you're right, that most people are going to see that being said. And and also, I mean, I love this polka dot address with the ruffles. It's just in the shoes. Oh, they're so good. The accessories are really good. And that is it's hard. It's really, really hard to make things that look desirable when, you know, you're part owned by caring, but you're really owned by a Qatari investment fund that does not have a big budget. And, you know, I just did a big piece with on Reformation, which is owned by Primera, which used to own Valentino. And I remember when they owned Valentino and that was when the Rock Stud, the Primera, the private equity firm, that's when the Rock Stud stuff got really big when Maria Grazia and Pierre Palo were there together. And it was just on fire. And then the last five years or so, it's just really, really dropped off and you just felt like they didn't have the budget anymore or something. But I mean, I'm looking at these little half Mary Jane flats. I mean, this is going to do well. And I think you're right. Like. There's it had the Alessandro Gucci had started to feel so strained and just everything over and over again. But there's something about this that that does feel renewed. What was the from from the menswear side? I mean, it's do you feel like it's harder and harder to kind of even talk about what you do? I guess you are writing for dudes who read the Wall Street Journal, so you can still really write about menswear, menswear. But I find it more and more challenging to talk about menswear versus women's wear, especially during men's fashion weeks, because it all sort of is blending together more than ever in in reality and not just these like ideas of genderless fashion or or what have you? Yeah. Well, certainly Milan is is really, I think as as a broader week. It's for men's is facing the problem that a lot of the one time anchors here, like, you know, Farragamo, Etro, Bottega, Bali, they they show during women's. They don't show during men's. I think for some brands that makes sense. I think for some brands that's a pretty strong strategic misstep. I think there are some of those brands I mentioned would probably be better served showing during mens, in my opinion. Just Bali, because you want to see it so badly. Well, also, I think I think, frankly, Farragamo, the the name recognition and the broader market positioning of Farragamo is, you know, a lot of men know what Farragamo is. And certainly, I think even Wall Street Journal readers know what Farragamo is. And so I'm always kind of a little bit perplexed why they don't try to make a stronger push to keep men interested in the brand. It seems to men's under the current direction seems to be a bit of an afterthought, maybe. But but also, yeah, Bali. I mean, Bali, I think would would do very well during Milan men's. I think it would be a standout show. Maybe that's a way of me saying Milan men's as they sit here on the last day had had few standouts. And I don't know. I to your question. Yes, sometimes it's hard to just, you know, totally only talk about what is going on for one side of the coin here. But I think some brands like, you know, and I don't know if this is 100 percent true, but I was talking to someone the other day and they said, you know, Prada is really guided by what happens on the menswear. And then the women's wear is kind of always reacting to that in a way, or always is kind of then in conversation with that. I don't know if I see that. That is that is a real that's a that's a big statement. I don't know if I see that. Especially right now. I think that I think that what they were kind of saying was some of the garments that we see on men's, then get perfected for women's. And I guess I feel that who knows how this collection will will kind of then be expressed through the women's wear. But but no, I mean, overall, to answer a different question, like this week is just is just pretty thin, I think, on super compelling stuff. And I do that seems to be kind of the consensus thought from the ground. And so I wonder if they will change things or try to change things going forward. Again, I think there is a lot of space here that if one of these brands that does show, Coed wants to start spending more money and showing two shows or what have you, they would find a receptive audience, let's say. But yeah, really quickly on the Farragamo thing. Do you watch that show industry? I do watch the show industry. I love it so much. Yeah, it's so it's so great. I actually got screeners for it. I was very excited because they know I like it. So they sent them. I still haven't watched. I'm going to watch it this week. But I heard those guys, the Conrad and Mickey, the show runners on a podcast once and they were talking about, maybe know a bit more about this, but I didn't realize that Farragamo ties and maybe it's not true anymore. But in the city, we're like, we're the higher ups were those and low and people like lower down the totem pole war airmez ties, which in fashion, you would assume the airmez tie was was the top tie. But they were maybe it doesn't exist anymore. But yeah, it's a great point of both Bali and I think Bali, it's like a budget thing. And there are more editors who go. And I mean, Bali is that guy should be designing Gucci. I just I know I say it all the time, but can you imagine what he would have done and and how how elated the world would have been? I mean, I don't think he can walk out on stage properly. So shy, but but it would have been amazing. It'd been amazing. Yeah, I have quite enjoyed looking at those ballet questions. I think they're good. I think they're very good. Yeah. Yeah. This show is brought to you by Boca. Boca knows that when you take care of your mouth, your whole body benefits.

So, so tell me you were at Pity, you were at, you were at, I've looked at the shows, the things that stood out obviously Prada, obviously J.W. Anderson, which I had a big story about on Thursday in Line Sheet last week, and then Magliano seems really great. I've, I don't know much about that brand, but I, I just love the styling of those collections. What, what have you liked? What, what has fallen flat? And, and what is sort of the anticipation around, what is sort of the anticipation around both Gucci today and Zenya? Well, you, you quickly hit on, I think the, the probably the highlights of, of Milan. Pity, which, you know, I think they needed a stronger anchor maybe to speak totally candidly. Paul Smith is, is wonderful. And I actually really do like those runway collections, but the, you kind of know what you're getting going into it. And the way the presentation was, it was intimate and it was very charming, but it lingered on the mind pretty temporarily, I would say. And then Marine Sare, I don't quite get that brand. I'm out. I'm out. And that felt like a really big production that they were trying to perhaps boost up a designer that I don't think has that kind of overall wow factor inherently. And is a brand that people were really like, I didn't feel people were like, oh my God, I'm really waiting for the show. And some years at Pity, one more, there really is that. I would also say walking the fair itself didn't find ton that I was like, oh, this is really great. It's some years just by dint of who's spending money at that time and who's exhibiting that time. You sometimes find some gems in there. I think that post COVID, the fair has continued to be a little bit slower to get back some key exhibitors and also some newer exhibitors that I think might inject life into that fair. It felt like a down year and certainly everyone I've spoken with has kind of echoed that. As for Milan, Moschino, it was his first men's show. The new creative director, I'm going to mispronounce it, Adrian Ebiola. I liked it. I think it was really campy and charming and really winsome. And I, you know, who, if you're mad about a pizza clutch and clothes printed with soccer balls, Moschino was certainly not for you. But I did think there was a nice balance there of the kind of frivolity with commerciality. There were some nice looking pants. There were certainly some excellent shoes. A theme of the week seems to be shoes that look like Loewe shoes but are not. This seems to have infected a lot of brands. But he was the creative director at Loewe. And not the creative director or the right hand to Jonathan Anderson. So I think comes naturally. But that was good. And then, you know, Magliano, I was left wondering. Yeah. What's the readout from that? Because from the outside, I'm like, that looks nice. I could see a lot of people getting styling ideas from it. Yeah. Styled incredibly well. Really rich with ideas. I don't know how this brand is seemingly as big as it is. The show felt really large in production. It had a ton of looks. So there was a lot of production in terms of the sampling going on. I would love to know a little bit more about that business. And I've been a fan of it. I think some people, it seemed, are a little tired of the derelict Armani look that he's kind of mastered. Incredible description. I think that it's, as an editor would say to a shaggy manuscript, there's some good stuff here. But I would love to see where that brand goes. He's certainly one of the very few interesting young characters here. And yeah, I'm still thinking about that show. So I've not landed on an idea. Prada, yeah. I mean, everyone's going to have their view on Prada. This one felt, certainly, and we're talking about this backstage, that this is what they wanted it to feel like, more youthful than ones have in recent memory. It felt more raft to me. I mean, the men's always a little more rough. Yeah, but it felt very, this one, I was like, oh, this really feels rough. Yeah, that that that Pancelowette was undeniably raft. The printing of the painter whose name, the works by the painter's name escapes me. That was very raft. I really liked the color palette of it. That's what's, you know, imprinted on my brain. But then, you know, I think that it's funny because this week has gotten so shrunken in a way. Like there used to be a time where, again, a lot more brands showed here. And so Prada now really feels like the only show that people have to have an opinion on, that people have to be there for, that you like, you know, it's what people wait for and then dissect on the come down throughout the rest of the this, you know, four day week. But to me, the strongest show of the week was J.W. Anderson. I, I'm pretty much a fan of a Loewe collection. J.W. sometimes I don't feel intelligent enough to get, but this one really landed. And I thought there was a lot of, you know, these, these knit cardigans with row houses depicted on them. These seem like something that will be a really strong commercial hit. Every, I posted a photo of the Guinness sweater, you know, I've got my brother who couldn't pick J.W. Anderson out of a lineup saying, I need this, you know, I think he, he is able to give the super progressive idea or the kind of challenging idea, like throughout the collection, the silhouettes had this very peculiar kind of ungainly hoop like shape, this diagonal hoop like shape across the midsection. You know, leather jackets had this kind of ski sloping shape to them. So he has, there's always this kind of broader silhouette idea in there that he's playing with. You know, often he shows a particular J.W. Anderson jackets with biker shorts or shorts or no pants. And he always seems very silhouette driven that way. But then within that, there's so much commercial concepts to grab onto and pieces that just seem to be aimed at getting people to spend. And he has an uncanny ability to make that stuff. And I could immediately see, oh, you know, in eight months, I'm going to be seeing people in these sweaters, like you just know, and a lot of brands you sit at, and you can't say that you can't say, oh, I know this product is going to land. I think with Jonathan, Jonathan Anderson, you can kind of always bet that that's going to be the case. Yeah, let's put a pin on Jonathan. Let's put a pin in Jonathan Anderson. We're going to talk about him quite a bit more, but I 100% agree. And I don't know if you saw him, I think it was Max Berlinger, our friend and colleague. He posted a photo of Raf and Mewcha in the little house on the Prada set, and then a photo of the house sweater from Jonathan. And it's so because so much of what Jonathan does is like, from he really is the same lineage as Prada. He, his big mentor was this woman who worked with Mewcha Prada for decades. And it's just, he's a genius. And we'll talk about him more really, really soon. But before we do, what are you looking forward to in Paris? I will see you, I'm going to come to like three, I think I'm going to go to Rick Owens, and Dries, and Sakai. And that's it. Because I'm really not there for shows. And I need to not, I cannot go to every single fashion week. But I didn't want to miss Dries. But what else are you looking forward to? Loewe, obviously. But is there anything else that you're, I mean, in Paris is still, it feels like right now, all fashion weeks feel a little bit like, what's that word dried out or something? Yes. Yes. There's just not much emaciated, emaciated. Yeah, they're emaciated. I think everyone is conscious that it's incredibly hard to break through the noise right now. And to make a trend happen, to make your brand happen at that time, to make a product happen, it's really, really difficult. And runway shows, I think in recent memory have perhaps not been very good at doing that. But you said, Rick, obviously Rick Owens is always a highlight, one of the very last few independence on the Paris calendar. This collection is titled Hollywood, which I think bodes well for us. Rick's themes always, you know, it's again, one of those last few shows that you really want to understand what he's thinking thematically and how it relates to what he's putting on the runway. It's always, I mean, what can you say? It's a Rick Owens show. It's like, I'm not going to try to make it sound anything other than that. It's just cool and great. And Dries has, you know, it's, whenever there's a retirement, people, it's all people can talk about. I think Dries is a particularly beloved designer and a designer who has produced in, really, when you think about it, an incredible amount of clothing over time and an incredible amount of ideas. And everyone is really curious as to what direction he will go to for the final show. You know, everybody loves Dries. Yeah. I mean, Dries, it's interesting because with the retirement, the kind of talk has been, well, what direction will he go? Like, will he just fully do the retrospective and basically try to hit all of his highlights over time? Or is he just going to give one last collection that's just quite good and has some kind of culmination at the end or something? That one seems to be, God, talk about drowning out all the competition. That's the one that people are just the most excited about it. And the one that I think people are talking about the most going into Paris. Yeah. So on Dries, I mean, I think one of the reasons the industry is so excited, A, because they really get to say goodbye to someone. I went to the last women's show and I was like, Oh, thank God I got to go. And then I saw Tim Blankson in London and he was like, Oh, you know, it's on Saturday night and it's a party. So I was like, I should, I should go to this. But I think a big thing with Dries is people in the fashion industry wear Dries. Like, everyone wears a lot of Dries and it's, it's a cross sort of personal style. It is just, it's for everyone if you're a fashion person, essentially. And I think that's part of the reason everyone is, is so excited to go. I actually did not bring any Dries on the strip, which is other than T-shirts, which is very rare for me. But, but yeah, I think that's why everybody, it's, it's not, people admire him and admire the runway and all of that. But it's also, and his ideas, but it's also that they actually wear, wear the stuff. Well, this is on menswear, at least this is the, this is the our legacy thing where it's, you know, our legacy shows here in Milan. This is like the editor brand. This is the, the brand that like, you know, people that go to fashion week, this is what they wear. And you, you want to be in that universe. And I think when you have that closer connection to the clothing, then when you see the collections and, you know, particularly with Dries, with, with him retiring, you know, that it's like you feel more of a personal investment in it. And that's a tricky area sometimes to be critical from, but certainly with his last collection, you know, I think this is a designer that won people over on the body. And that's, that's the best thing a designer can do. And that's seemingly a rarity in a lot of ways these days, but yeah, for sure. I think it's, if you look at all the, all the things, all the brands that you talked about that have commercial viability right now, but that you're also excited about are things that you could see people wearing it really easily, but there are still ideas there and it's getting harder and harder. And that's why looking through this, I'm, I'm, as we're talking slowly going through this Valentino slide show, I'm on look 75, you know, I like this better than the Gucci, especially at the end of the Gucci. I was never a huge personal fan of the Gucci understood it, but I like this. I mean, all these, these jackets, buttonless jackets, these little skirt sets, it looks really cute. So we'll see. I mean, let's also see how the quality is. I'm sure it'll be good, but let's see what, what the accessories look like at retail. It's time for spring cleaning. We're not talking about your closet.

Let's get on to the rumor of the week. I had this piece last week. I heard a few weeks ago that J.W. Anderson had met with the sort of powers that be at Fast Retailing about selling Jonathan Anderson, the person had met with Fast Retailing about selling the J.W. Anderson brand to Fast Retailing. It is owned by or majority owned by LVMH, which he is also the designer of Loewe, as we've mentioned. I confirmed it on both sides. And then I did talk to someone from J.W. Anderson who said, we're very happy at LVMH, etc., etc. I don't think that this meeting was anything other than a meeting. And but to me, it indicates that Jonathan Anderson is just being smart about his, the business of Jonathan Anderson. And what I wanted to discuss with you is he is such a unique person in, he is such a unique designer in that he has the sort of brilliance and genius quality of the generation ahead of him, the Gen X designers like Alessandro and Mark Jacobs and Ralph Simmons and all of these people who are big thinkers who you leave excited and exhilarated when you see one of their collections. But then he also has like the extreme commerciality of like a Virgil Applo or trying to think of another millennial designer or even just, you know, Virgil is probably the best example of that. But maybe Pharrell is not millennial, but you know what I mean? Like that more modern, super commercial, we're not thinking about the idea part as my, I mean, there were a lot of ideas in Virgil stuff, but the idea was the commerciality. So he, but he has this like interesting mix of things. He's, he's sort of the platonic ideal of a fashion designer in this era. What do you think his value is to LVMH? And if it were up to you, sure, it would be great for him to design Loewe forever, but I think he's probably going to want to do something more or they're going to want him to do something more. What would the ideal scenario be to you where he ends up in that, if he stays at LVMH in that whole world? Well, I think I think he's laid it out pretty clearly. Like what he offers is creativity and ideas and incredible advertising campaigns with celebrities that's that he seems to have this really magnetic pull with and, and, and he gets people to do stuff for Loewe that don't do stuff for other brands. You know, I always think the Loewe front row in Paris looks like none other with, in terms of who he gets and all the guys kind of look great. And they seem to genuinely want to be there and seem to have some deeper relationship with him. And, you know, beyond that, like, you know, it's, it is totally one of those brands that if I slapped every look on WSJ.com, my readers would, you know, chase me out of town with flaming torches. But I think that certainly in the store, like they, there's, you know, stuff my dad can wear, there's stuff I can wear, you know, he the trickle down, he has mastered. And that is what if, you know, creative director is quote unquote supposed to do. And does every creative director do that? No, but do that effectively now. And I think I'm not I don't really like playing the game of like, where should he ideally end up? Like I probably, if I was a betting man, would probably put my money on him eventually becoming a costume designer full time. And, you know, saying I did my brand, I did Loewe for a long time, and he did it very well by both commercial and critical measures. And maybe that's what he wants out of it. He, you know, is doing costumes for another would look like a guanadino movie that's coming out soon. So that's, and he obviously, as we've discussed, the costumes for challengers. So I think maybe that's the pathway that he ends up in his name has come up enough in rumors that I, you know, it's hard to ignore any, any single time a rumor comes up, his name comes up. Yeah. You know, is he going to Celine? Is he going to Chanel? But I think he's, it's such a good fit for him at Loewe, the brand being focused on craft. And he has made a whole universe there of products that he guided. And to want to start over, you have to think like, is that what this designer wants right now? And I can't speak for him, but I, you know, he seems to be in a comfortable home. And maybe that's enough. I think it's not enough. I think you're right. But I think he is, he's too great. He's too creative. I mean, he's made Loewe. That brand is his. And so in that way, I agree. And he has been able to push forward previously where, you know, at first his runway shows were, they were good, but he probably what five years ago really had it, or maybe like around the pandemic actually with the more surrealist stuff really had a, there was a turning point. I think he's just very ambitious. And the costume designer thing is interesting. A lot of that's going to have to do with, you know, how, how has he managed his personal finances? And, and that's a, you have a way of life. And I'm sure he's very well taken care of and, and they value him. And so that's, that's part of it too. It's, it's that whole thing of, are you going to pull a helmet laying and just become an artist or whatever? But, but I do think someone emailed me after that story and said, I really do think he's a dark horse for Chanel. And it's true. He could really do Chanel and he could do it well. I think the Chanel thing is interesting in that who wants that job? Like these big, big jobs, Dior, Louis Vuitton Chanel, Chanel is probably the most appealing out of all of them because it's Chanel, but, and it's still Chanel. And also, I think working with, with the worthimers and, and in that framework would be harder and easier in some ways than working within a big group. But it's those jobs sound, there, it's a lot of management, especially at Dior and Louis Vuitton. Like you're basically a manager. And then you also have to be creative. And that, look at Nicola, I guess, Gare, I mean, he, he has, I think his last few collections have actually been some of the best that he's done there. And other than the ones he did in the beginning, but in the middle, it was, it was real rough for a while. And I think that's because like, you're under this tremendous amount of pressure. It's just completely insane. So I see what you're saying that Loewe is he could do that for another 15 years, and it would be great. And he would leave them with something, you know, they, they had, it had nothing before. But I think he's just such a, he seems like such an ambitious person in terms of ideas and commerciality that if, if he, if he doesn't do something else, he's at least thinking about it all the time. I don't doubt that. I'm, I'm so glad that you, you know, just talked that through though, because it's like at Loewe, the scale of the brand within the broader LVMage portfolio is such that I think he does have more room to be creative and he does have probably a little bit more of a leash and independence to, to, you know, play with stuff. And the bigger and bigger you get, the more, you know, the restrictions come in around you. And, and the more you are being pulled into meetings that are about nothing related to design and, and, and you are a, you know, super national company that, that, that everything you touch goes across the world. And Loewe is that, but I think Loewe is more selective in where it appears now. And it is just at a different scale. The interesting question to me has kind of always been like, how much more can they scale up Loewe? And I think that that is where perhaps it becomes external forces more than, than Anderson's own thinking is like, you know, if the brand suddenly decides that it wants to be a, you know, five X the size it is today, then, then I think that might become a different, the demands might be different. And, you know, then maybe he makes a different decision based off of that. But again, I still think, you know, for now he's, you know, I think he might be really happy being this figure of, you know, almost universal acclaim throughout the, the fashion world. You know, it's, it's, it's rare to walk through these weeks and find someone that didn't like the JW collection or that didn't like the Loewe collection in particular, you know, those OEs, it's again, they're the collections that people circle on their calendar and to have that status, you know, that's, that's got to feel good. And, you know, is that enough to squelch your ambition? Who knows? I'm not, I'm not Jonathan Anderson, but I guess we shall see in terms of how far that ambition wants to take him. Or flame, or flame that ambition. Yeah, yeah, because it's just like, Oh my God, I, I wonder how much he, he definitely pays attention. I wonder how much he pays attention. Jacob, this was great. Enjoy your, enjoy Paris. Enjoy your vacation. You're back in a couple of weeks. And I'll see you at least on Saturday, probably on Saturday. Looking forward. Well, talk soon. Thanks again. Thanks. And Kurt Kourtney. Each spring, 23 Pulitzer Prizes are awarded for distinguished journalism, books, drama, and music. There was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll, and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out it was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th. Follow and listen on Apple podcasts, the Odyssey app, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcast.",
