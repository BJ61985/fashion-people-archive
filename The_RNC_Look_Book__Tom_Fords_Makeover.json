And today on the show, the Wall Street Journal's Jacob Gallagher joins me to discuss the industry's most recent news dump from the supreme acquisition to the breakup of online ceramics to what everyone was wearing at the Republican National Convention. Plus, the rumor of the week that quickly became a reality. Tom Ford's creative director just got fired. Let's get started. Hey, everyone. Hope you're having a great week. It is somehow quite a busy time for news and fashion. I'm spotlighting the most interesting bits in line sheet every Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. It's mid-July, people. Let's take a break. Over the last week alone, Rachel Surgat's my partner in beauty. And I have covered everything from Peter Hawking's leaving Tom Ford, which Jacob and I are going to get into later, and to what's really going on in Estee Lauder, which of course also owns Tom Ford. And just this past Monday, I shared some Chanel executive succession planning intel. I addressed this Galliano-Margella leaving, Galliano leaving Margella rumor again. I've addressed it many times already. And it never ends. Also definitely be sure to follow me on Twitter. I have a very annoying name on there, La Premie D. Sorry, it's L-A-P-R-E-S-M-I-D-I. I make mistakes and I made mistakes in my early 20s, mid-20s. So forgive me for that. Someday I might have a more commercial name on there, but who knows. I do occasionally break news on there. And if it's out of our publishing cycle on Friday, I reported the Hawking's news four days before. I also said the announcement will be coming Monday morning before the markets open, which it did. So definitely check that out. And we, Jacob and I just have so much. I can't believe he actually went to the RNC. So we have a lot to cover, so we'll get going now. Jacob, welcome back to fashion, people. It's been a while. Thank you. It's been a while. I've been all over the world since we last spoke. So yeah. I've been getting a lot of requests. We didn't get to cover Wimbledon. We didn't get to cover Vogue World Paris. Or like one shake of coming back. We'll be able to talk about the Olympic tennis outfits, I think, which will be more interesting than the all white Wimbledon fits. But I suppose we did not talk about Vogue World, which now feels like an absolute distant memory. As you just said those words to me, I was reminded that I was even there. I kind of forgot that I attended that. But yeah. Yeah. Chris Black was on the next day for you. He had a weird take on it, so it was enough. But it would have been fun. We can't go back. What we can do is talk about all this crazy news. So last week, you were in Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention. Have you done this before? You covered it for the journal. A, have you done this before? I feel like maybe you have. You haven't. No, this was my first time. I was actually, as I said to a few people when I was there, I'm probably the only person on planet Earth that was ever at Paris Fashion Week when they got the call that they would be attending the Republican National Convention. My editors had the very smart idea to send me. Their thinking was that my job entails a lot of looking around and thinking about things. And there was a lot to look at at the RNC. So that's why I was dispatched there. I was not in any capacity sent to cover the actual political pageantry of it. But I did cover a lot of the theatrics outside the FISER Forum and across the various kind of outer reaches of the convention. But it was definitely a illuminating experience, I would say. And I think if there is ever a party to cover in terms of its optics and aesthetics, I think that it is the modern Republican Party, which is more obsessed with merch and more obsessed with standing out through their clothes than I think any American political party has been in a very long time. And as we both know, what you wear says a lot about who you are. And I think your editors are right. Your observations are the type of observations that travel around the internet for months and sometimes years at a time. One question I had for you, and this is a kind of maybe a boring one. The Never Trumpers versus the Trumpers, is there like, could you pick a Never Trumper? Are the Never Trumpers like more normal in the way they dress? Or like, could you pick them out of a lineup there? Or because I know you went to one of their events. I almost thought to do like a taxonomy post of what the various outfits, because everyone was very easily identifiable. I would say 80% plus of people were in that Trump camp, were all the way for the Trump presidency and probably even more than 80% if I'm being honest, probably somewhere around the 90%. And what they don't tell you about a political convention before you go is that people actually tend to be much older than you would expect, which makes sense. Delegates are often people that are entrenched members of the party. They've probably given money. They've probably been involved in party politics locally for a long time. So they were in their 60s plus in a lot of cases. And those people that were delegates and were for Trump, you know, I'm talking the cowboy hats, the full red, white and blue, very spangled, very conspicuous. And then there, I'll get to the Never Trumpers in a second, but the contingent that kind of fascinated me was the younger Republicans who were a lot of red dresses, a lot of suits that did not fit, I would say, perfectly on the guys probably first suit out of college vibes there. But, you know, they, that little pack, I was very interested in. I spoke to a few of them and I went to a New York Young Republicans event, which was just all blue blazers and big cigars and was every cliche you could possibly imagine. Now, the Never Trumpers, they dress like your traditional national review conservative, I would say, still, you know, they are very trotty in their way. I wouldn't say they're stylish. I don't think that there were many people. I saw one woman and and she went by so quickly in a Prada hat and a full Miyake set. And I was so and she just went by really quickly and I turned to try to grab her and she was just gone in the pack. I'd love to know what responses that woman got because designer clothing at this whole event stood out so significantly. But yeah, I think that you can feel the the old way and how people dress and I guess perhaps the new way and how the younger guys dress. But then again, it's 90 percent just full Trump buttons, red, white and blue elephants on the hat. You know, it's it's the full regalia all the way for for their chosen candidate. Sounds like me at the Dodgers game yesterday when I saw one lady in the isy Miyake dress and I was like, she had had a little straw hat that did have a Dodgers thing. I was truly the only person in the stadium without some sort of paraphernalia on. Similar experience, you know, similar. You got to show your team and in all facets of American life, you got to show your team. You know, it's funny. I've been thinking a lot about the younger publicans of the 1980s in connection to weirdly Shannon Doherty dying. OK, yeah, yeah, because let me explain. So my uncle is 17 years older than me. He's like a graduate of the Naval Academy. He's a Republican still. But he was like a trendy Republican in the 1980s. Like it was trendy to be a Republican and it was like very Alex P. Keaton coded. In which I'm assuming that the Never Trumpers are still like glomming onto that. I'm not a vigorously. Yes. And there were these 19 in the 1980s. There were young Hollywood people who were like, I'm a Republican. And Shannon Doherty was one of them. And I was just thinking about it last week. It's all it's all connected. Yeah, but I wonder really where that will where that will go, because, you know, and maybe this is getting into what you were going to ask about kind of the overall vibe. But yeah, that is disappearing. I mean, that is shrinking rapidly. And I would say the kind of the the Maga wing of the party. This is obviously what everyone coming out of it was. Reflecting upon the Maga wing of the party has really dominantly taken over. You can see that in the the pure merchandise. It's all Trump hats. It's everything is correlated back to the candidate. And obviously that can't be forever. But for the time being, it has really drowned everything else out. Are you going to go to the DNC? I will be at the DNC, which I should say this going into this, it felt like, OK, we knew what the RNC was going to be and we knew what the DNC was going to be. The RNC certainly lived up to my expectations, I think. And I wrote about this a little bit. It was and again, a lot of people that were there, a lot of reporters smarter than I and more versed in politics than I have reflected upon this. Very jubilant. You know, the party really the Republican Party really was truly believing that Trump was going to win. I one thing that stood out to me just in terms of the merchandise and what people were wearing, every hat almost had 45, 47 stitched stitched on it, which is like when people get the tattoo of their sports team winning the Super Bowl before they win. Like I was really struck by how confident people were in having 47 on every item of clothing. And they really believe he's going to be the 47th president. Now, that paradigm, I think, changes a little bit today. I would love to know what a lot of those people I spoke with think as they wake up this week, because to your question about the DNC, the DNC is now very different than what I expected it was going to be a week ago. I. To any listeners out there that have a lead on any coconut merch or anyone making coconut merch, let me know, because that is what I will be expecting to see. I think the the meming of Kamala will be in full effect by that point and people leaning into it and we'll certainly see what it looks like. I do not expect for the DNC to be as cohesive in terms of look. That's just a given the Democratic Party is not as united in their aesthetics as they are not as united in their policy or in around a single candidate right now, as it seems, but we'll see come a few weeks. Yeah, I'm curious. Did you spot any tuck or nock dresses? I don't know if I'm smart enough to I have identified exactly that dress, but I believe I saw a few of them. But I think I wonder if I'm sure I did at DNC also because it is a bipartisan dress. Yeah, I'll be on the lookout for it. Kamala, for me, her use of Irene Newerth jewelry is is she's been wearing it forever. She she secretly or like privately has worked with the stylist, Carla Welch. I don't know if that's ever been confirmed publicly, but it's one of those things that everyone knows. Yeah, I'll shout out my colleague, Rory Satcher, and has written about Kamala's clothes. Going back, I think many years now, because obviously this happened many years ago, when she came on to the scene as VP. So yeah, yeah. And you should follow Rory. I'm sure she'll be covering this super closely. She will. This is a big turn for her. I had exciting. It's you know, I had thought, oh, God, we got Biden and Trump again, and I don't know what I'm going to write about either of them. It's also big din. And now there's a new candidate on the horizon. So we shall see what coverage comes out of that. Can't wait. Let's hope it's Gavin Newsom just because it's like two really good looking people. No comment on that front. No comment.

Moving on to another kind of merch. Supreme gets acquired by Esalor Luxotica, the eyewear company. Big picture. What do you think? My boring answer is this makes sense from a VF Corp perspective. That was my initial feeling was that they just desperately needed money. And this is what every analyst who reads this closely and who is much better versed on this topic than I am kind of saying this is just a way for them to free up capital. They're selling it at a loss. I believe they bought it for VFC, bought it for 2.1 billion, sold it for 1.5 billion. And Esalor Luxotica, you know, fascinating turn for them. I suppose when you've bought every sunglass company in the world, you start looking at clothing companies as options and maybe that's what they're thinking was. You know, as far as my understanding is at Supreme, Jebya is back in charge. The Tremaine Emery chapter we don't need to reflect upon, but that came to a close. And as far as I have heard from several people that are around the brand and that have worked with the brand, that Jebya is back in the office every day, that he is very involved in design decisions. And I think that, you know, I should say I'm a consumer of the brand. I pay attention to Supreme very, very closely. I think there's energy around the brand again. I think this was probably a very savvy buy from Luxotica. Will they let it alone is kind of the big question. And what do they want out of it in terms of expansion? VFC had really broad expansion thoughts initially about Supreme that most of them did not come to fruition. But I suppose time will tell if there will be two more stores in the next couple of years or if there will be 10 to 20, I would lean more toward two, probably. Yeah, I think that they're going to leave them alone at least for a few years. Look, it's a twenty three billion dollar a year in sales company. They don't care about the five hundred million dollars in sales Supreme is doing. And I likened it in line sheet to the way a lot of the beauty licensing companies like Pooge used to mostly like to make fragrance for other companies. Now they own their own beauty brands. They own Charlotte Tilbury. They own by Rado and they've bought outright bought Dries Van Noten, things like that. They haven't really changed the Dries Van Noten business much. And so when you think about it that way, it pushes much smaller company than S.L.O.R. at Luxotica. But it's just this point of licenses aren't going to be around forever. And they're in a good position right now. They own Ray Ban. They own Purcell. The good they own good I wear brands. But like the designer brands Oakley, which also already does merch and things. So they do have a little experience in apparel manufacturing. But but the the main issue is like the Gucci's of the world. Those kinds of companies are doing their own eyewear now. So it's going to just become that in fashion. Eyewear was the last big licensing thing because it's such a particular expertise. And so and some for some brands footwear, but it was sort of the last bastion of that kind of operation and it still exists. But it's kind of like AOL making a bunch of money off of dial up after no one you know has dial up. They're they'll keep making money off of this for, you know, 10, 20 years. But they do have to start to diversify. So I wonder if and from what I heard from people at VF and Supreme, it was just the best deal like they had other offers, but it was the best deal. And also like it's still I mean, it was in cash. Like it's still a lot of money for this company that and and I think you're I've heard the same thing about James and and yes, we don't have to bring up the Tremaine stuff right now, but it was it was a time and you know, he just wants to be left alone to do what he wants to do. And it sounds like they're going to at least allow that for a few years. So weird, weird match up, but also probably good. The question I have is the Supreme brand. And maybe this is just a minor question, but, you know, a lot of their collaborations were with other VFC companies, you know, Dickies and the North Face and Vans. And there were a lot of broader corporate synergies there. And I wonder if those will continue. You know, I mean, these were brands that Supreme collaborated with beforehand. And, you know, I'm sure that it made a lot of bottom line sense to just do all of that manufacturing and bring those brands together, you know, across the portfolio. But it definitely stood out to me that that, you know, now the those tie ups won't be there. But I also just think, you know, maybe this does open up new possibilities of what Supreme can do. And, you know, Supreme has certainly done eyewear before. I wonder if that'll become a broader part of, you know, will there be Supreme sunglasses at Sunglass Huts? I kind of doubt that. But I also could see that as a way to expand the brand without totally diluting it for the main consumer. Totally. Have they ever done a collaboration with Ray Ban? No. No, I don't think so. They've done their own sunglasses for years now. And I think they do sell pretty well. I mean, it's a low margin business or it's a high margin business, rather, so it probably does does well for them. I think they'll keep collaborating with those VF brands. I don't think there's any hard feelings. I truly don't. I think it's like the guy who runs VF needs to make his investors happy. It was easy to get rid of Supreme. It's going to, it would have been much harder to sell vans. So like, and, and so, and that's again, we can do a deep dive on vans some day. But, but I think it makes sense, which again, as, as every analyst will tell you, the big problem for VFC remains vans and it has been vans and it will continue to be vans until they can figure out how to make that brand relevant again. But yeah, coming soon, a special report from me and Jacob, how to fix vans. We should just do an episode of that at some point. I'll tell you, the answer is not a sterling Ruby collab, which was what they bet their recent lifestyle push on, but we'll see. Yeah, it's, I don't know how you make a sneaker brand cool again in this moment. I think that this is a question that a lot of sneaker brands are having. But again, I think for vans is a particularly flashing red sign. Okay. Moving forward because we have a lot of ground to cover. I made a joke in the newsletter teasing you about this online ceramics breaking up. The news was broken by our friend, Sam Hyne at GQ. And I kind of felt bad for him because it was like the morning of the Supreme News. So I made a little joke, like condolences, you got this scoop also, but don't worry, Jacob's still jealous, which I really doubt you, you were jealous of the scoop, but we are happy for Sam that he got a scoop. But tell me why this was even a thing. There was a press release that went out. Like what is the big deal that, that online, what is online ceramics? Online ceramics for our Tucker Knuck wears. And why did they break up? Well, God, I mean, I was left thinking, as we were talking about what you talked about today, that wow, did this brand go so much further than it probably ever should have, or anyone bet it would have initially. I mean, a brand born out of grateful dead iconography and selling shirts. When I first encountered the online ceramics guys, I met them at a dead in company show. Where they were selling merch in the lot. Like they, they are, they were effectively a like bootleg t-shirt brand that could and they went really, they went very far. They ended up in Dover Street Market. They collaborated with Mark Jacobs as heaven and I, I, they had so many A24 shirts come out. And I think that they developed a genuine business and they were a brand that you could point to during that moment when merch was really soaring and taking off. And they were doing this idiosyncratic wild thing. It brought together tie-dye, which was itself a trend and the dead, which was, you know, people might not want to look at it this way, but it was also very much a trend. And, but I think that it was clear in looking at the brand as it went along that it kind of became two different brands. There were two different founders. And I think that as they matured, they had different tastes and it did kind of split in terms of looking at shirts. And I think in Sam's piece, one of them even says as much that there were, there were customers for, it was, it's, it's Alex and I can't remember the other founder's name, which is terrible, but that there were. It doesn't matter. There were, yeah, Alex and, and, and Elijah and that there were different shoppers for different guys. And, and I think, you know, again, this is just yet another wrinkle in this ongoing question of is merch dead and evolving? And certainly within, you know, Sam's article, I think they both said as much that they wanted to build real fashion brands or real clothing brands. And maybe they just differed in which direction to go. But, you know, from a t-shirt to an actual brand, people have done it before and I'd be really curious to see if, if one of them can pull that off. They have a lot of brand name recognition already. So. Yeah. I'm going to start paying attention beyond any post no me fry would do about them, which was my, the extent of my interest in online ceramics. They were to their absolute credit, some of the most creative items of clothing being produced in the past several years came out online ceramics in my opinion. Those shirts were witty and crazy and they were, they confronted big themes like death and drug use. And they did it in a way that I thought was clearly very compelling. You could walk around most major cities on a given day and see someone in an online ceramic shirt. You can't say that for a lot of brands and, you know, hats off to these guys. It's true. Congrats to them. We'll be watching whatever they do next. This show is brought to you by Boca. Boca knows that when you take care of your mouth, your whole body benefits.

You know who is not wearing online ceramics today. Glenn Powell, who is on a tear right now with Daisy Edgar Jones. They are co-stars in this movie Twisters, which I have not seen. I might go see with my friend this week. I have not seen yet. I, A, have you seen Twisters? B, have you been following Glenn Powell's sort of red carpet looks? I'm very curious what you think because I have a very strong opinion about both of these people and what they're doing right now in terms of dressing up for events. Maybe I am bunting a little bit here, but Glenn Powell, wow, we actually, you know, for a long time here at the Journal, we've had this ongoing question of where the movie star is. Glenn Powell in one year solved that question pretty quickly. He is a genuine movie star. I think that that is why there's so much attention on what he's wearing. He looks very good. He has kind of a, I guess, classic Hollywood meets all America, which I'm just saying all the cliché is possible about a guy who's handsome and wears jeans in a suit well. So I think, you know, there was this question of, you know, Timothy Chalamet or who, you know, Austin Butler, maybe these guys are just frankly too weird for the broader public, but Glenn Powell has now opened a movie that opened at $80 million, which is incredibly good for the current box office. And he gave a very traditional red carpet look. This guy is in the Tom Cruise lane. He has found his footing. And I think as long as he can continue to wear Tom Ford suits well, I will say the only thing that rings in my head about Glenn Powell and fashion is this anecdote, I think from Nate Freeman's. No, it was Brooks Barnes. It was Brooks Barnes. Brooks Barnes, one of them, like a Vanity Fair Oscar party where it's a, it's like an overheard of Glenn Powell saying to Tom Ford, Oh, I'm wearing you tonight. And it's like, it didn't, there wasn't the next line of what Tom Ford said back to him, but I'm like, did he say, no, I didn't design that. Or did he say, yes, I designed that and they continue to run it off. And it looks great on you, but my company is going to hell. But I would love to have known what Tom Ford actually thought in the moment. But yeah, Glenn Powell, I think as long as he can continue to do this run of like, I guess really he's probably more in the Ryan Gosling lane a little bit. He's like a new younger Gosling, but again, traditional Hollywood, traditional movie star mold, it works. I have no thoughts about Daisy Edgar Jones's clothes. I feel like they relate in some way to Twister, which is this, I don't like I keep seeing dresses that look twisted, but maybe I'm reading too much into it. But yeah. Okay. So I, I really like Glenn Powell. I'm a big fan of his Netflix movie, set it up with great movie, Zoe Deutsch. It's a great movie. I really didn't like his, who's the guy the days and confused director who's moving. Oh, everybody, everybody, everybody wants them. I like that movie, but he was in this new one. The hit manner. Yeah, I didn't like it. It's not good. It's not good. It's a weak movie. But I really, I enjoy him. I like him. Obviously I love Top Gun Maverick. One the best. It was so good. I enjoy him. I like his thing. I think he's very cute. I don't want to go through all my reviews, but also that Sydney Sweeney movie very bad, but he's great. He's a great actor. He's durable. He doesn't seem to have chemistry with any women, which doesn't make sense. But I like him. He looks amazing in Breone. He, he looks a lot of times though, like it's or Tom Ford, like really classic. I think it's like verging on costume. He looked great in those jeans that he wore this last weekend, but I just have a real problem when these stylish dress people up to look like they are in costumes. I don't understand it. It just doesn't feel like anytime I get all the releases from Breone for some reason, I don't get a lot of those celebrity PR releases anymore, but like he always looks great in Breone. I just think like, why do you have to put him in like the open neck call? It's just a little too much for me sometimes. And I think it makes him seem even more hokey, which he is slightly hokey, which is totally fine. But like, I just think it makes him seem a bit more hokey. And I wish it was a tad, a tad more traditional, but you know, he lives in Texas and he is in Richard Lake Glader films. So maybe he's trying to, it does remind me of Ryan Gosling. I think it's very Gosling. Can I make a broader comment though about kind of the nature of red carpet styling, which is that I think men, the actors that are out there, they haven't yet found, like there isn't the Daniel Goldberg stylist for men yet, which is like kind of the normal, if you will. Like the, I'm just going to make you look as chic and cool as possible. I still think that it may be this is, and who knows how well Glenn Powell knows clothes, but there still seems to be a level with a lot of actors where it's like, I'm putting you in this thing and you're going to wear this thing. And this is what you should be wearing. And you can sometimes just, this isn't about Glenn Powell. This is like a broader thought of like, you can sometimes really feel that like that the guy has no idea what to do. And so they rely on the stylist to make all the choices. And they do look like a costume, you know, they can't carry it well. Whereas clearly, again, Daniel Goldberg and the people she styles, it's, they are, that's a partnership. And you can really feel that these people like those clothes and they're happy in them. I'd love to see that come through and feel more visible with men. I think Michael Fisher, I think gets there a lot of the time. You can really feel that his clients are super into clothes and super involved. And, you know, Oscar Isaacs looks great in what they pick. And I would love to see more of that out there. I 100% agree. I was going to say Michael Fisher. He is, we've discussed this. He's John Mulaney stylist who looked amazing on that show. He looked great. I saw him. We talked about that. But he does Jake Gyllenhaal. Like he does people and he can, they can wear crazy shit, but it doesn't look like they were told wear this. It's like making them look like real people. So I agree. I think that Michael Fisher is the men's stylist to watch right now. Or just like put him in a suit. Like Ellaria Urbanotti, I think is very hit or miss. When she used to do, Jake, when she used to do Ben Affleck and Ben Affleck was just like in nice suits. Like that guy that just put him in a nice suit. Like it just, that is the part it's like, if you want to do the fashion thing, know your, know your subject. And, and I think Michael Fisher is the one to watch really quickly on Daisy, the twisted thing is funny. She has her stylist is Danny Michelle who does Haley Beiber for day where Carla Welch does it like she'll work with her on certain red carpet things. I think she's looked really good. And she's not a person like a lot of British actresses end up working with like a leaf Clark or someone who's very romantic. And it ends up like you go through the Kieran nightly, you go down that path of like wearing a lot of florals and shit and air dem, which looks great on certain people, but not on others. And I think she's looked really hot and like just cool and fun. And I thought it was great. And I wasn't really following Danny Michelle that closely previously because I was like, you just dressed Haley Beiber during the day. I don't really care. You're her best friend or whatever. But now I'm like fall following her really closely. So I think Danny is one to watch her Donnie or however she says it. And I, I thought Daisy looked great. So you mentioned this Tom Ford joke in the Brooks Barnes New York time story, which I wanted to put in my line sheet piece on the Tom Ford news, but I think it may just be too overkill. I'm in the middle of writing it. So it just might be too much, but it was something that I kept thinking about. We got it in here. Like also glamp. How goes to too many events, whoever is his PR person. He's at every single thing. I'm just like, I don't need to see you again. You're too famous to be at this thing. But anyway, Tom Ford last week, I heard from someone, Oh, they're not showing in Milan. So called. No, we don't comment on rumors. It was like, okay, I'm just going to, I know this is true. I'm going to run a small, small thing. I get a message from someone connected to the brand being like, you really don't know what's going on. And I said, no, I mean, literally, I cannot get all these things myself. I cannot be following every single designer change. And they were like, Oh, he got fired. And so then I called, I did make a bunch of calls and I confirmed with three sources that he got fired. I did a tweet on Friday because I don't publish on Fridays. I knew that the release is coming Monday morning. So the release comes out. They don't say anything. The person who runs the beauty says we think Peter Hawking's for your service. The person who runs fashion says we think Peter Hawking's for your service. I'm going to have a bunch more. I had a bunch more in line sheet because this comes out after lunch. She is really is released. But generally, like as someone, Tom Ford matters way more. It's still, it's just a small fashion business overall, but most of it is menswear. What do you think about the last year of that brand as a menswear reporter? And like, what do you think they need to succeed moving forward? It's such a tough question because he ultimately the brand was so, this was a brand that was so tethered to its founder and the vision that he had, but also just him as a personality. I think there were a lot of guys that, you know, saw Tom Ford as this figure of handsomeness and cheekiness and glamour. They wouldn't use those words, but I think they understood instinctively that this guy looked cool and they wanted to be a part of that. And, you know, I always think about like a couple of years ago, going back a few years, I'd have conversations with department store buyers and I'd be like, what are best selling brands? And Tom Ford was still always a brand that came up even after people on the runway, like critics wanted to say, oh, the runway got worse or it doesn't matter anymore or what have you. Like, it's still sold really well commercially. You know, I did feel like under Peter Hawking that the menswear wasn't a focus. I certainly felt that like there was no, you know, this was a guy who seemed to really be interested in women's wear and, you know, the runway shows were clearly shaped around that. And I wonder though, where it does go from here. You had basically a Tom Ford acolyte. You had someone who worked there and someone who looked a lot and dressed a lot like Tom Ford and only in the last year is what I was told. So sure. So, so, but, but, but, but, also a little weird, but, but certainly publicly, you know, I think, you know, it definitely makes me think a broader question of can a brand like that, you know, cult of personality style exist in a merge and can a creative director have that kind of impact in terms of a male consumer? I don't know if that's possible anymore. Does the broader shopper, the guy that goes to Mr. Porter and buys Tom Ford jeans, does he know that Tom Ford has undergone a creative redirection? I don't think so, probably. They need someone who can be a steady hand and just keep making good sweaters and good suits and, you know, stuff that NFL players want to wear and celebrities want to wear and keep cranking that stuff out. And as long as they don't upset that business, I don't think they're in any trouble in terms of men's wear. The big question is though, how long do you keep that going before you just are so boring that people forget about you? But that's, it's a fine balance, obviously. Yeah, it's so strange because Peter ran the men's studio out of London for the whole time. So why, why he was so focused on women's for, I think because Tom Ford is such a traditional brand in that the women's wear was really a marketing vehicle to sell the fragrance and beauty. And so I think that he, he, I don't know if he, that was what the directive he was given or what it was, or he wanted to prove that he could do women's wear. And what I said was, I mean, I never, a lot of people really hated it. I thought it just looked like a neutered version of Tom Ford and Gucci. And Tom Ford women's wear was like a little eccentric and which is why it didn't sell that well, but they did have like a very good private client business. So that part's interesting. I mean, I think one thing to note, like I, Dylan Byers, who, who writes our media column came on here a couple of weeks ago to talk Sun Valley fashion, and Dylan like, he knows enough about fashion. He knows who Brunello Cuccinelli is like, he knows enough, but he mentioned Tom Ford polos. Like Tom Ford is like a succession brand. So all these guys, they know what Tom Ford is. And so I think people who we were just talking about Brioni, which I feel like I just really like Brioni a lot and, and think it's, it's, it's just nice for like, if I was a rich guy and wanted to look nice, that's what I would wear. But, but like I, a lot of people don't know. And the crazy thing is like Zenia, I mean, I guess if you buy suits, you know what Zenia is, but Zenia is a much bigger business than, than Tom Ford. But yeah, I think it's, it's complicated because Tom Ford is not old. He's young and he is still influential in the culture. He's still out in the culture. And so I think he made the right decision to leave. I think the wrong decision was probably to keep this like continuity going. I think they probably thought, let's do this for a few years in the same way Frida Giannini, I don't know if that's how you pronounce her last name, but whatever, the woman who essentially replaced Tom Ford at, at Gucci, she essentially for 10 years did a sort of take on Tom Ford's aesthetic and that really worked. And that's been a thing that if you look at Saint Laurent after, after Eddie Slaman left, Anthony Vacorello kind of did, he, it was there, it would, I remember they, them saying it was evolution, not revolution. Eventually it totally changed. But at the beginning, and so I think what they thought was like, this will keep things going for a while. And then 10 years from now, we can really change. But the reality was he, he kept too close to what they were doing. And I think, and also the other big thing is what's happening at Estee Lauder with the fragrance and beauty. And that is like a way bigger issue that Rachel's going to get into this week in line sheet. But like, it's, it's complicated. I feel like the, the hilarious thing, the first time I heard that Peter was out, I was, the email said, I heard that Hedy Slaman is going there. And like, it's not true. It can't, if it's true, I'll be like, great. I, there's no way it's true. But the point being that like, actually they actually did need to, to at least change it a bit or at least give it the best time when, when you have the sort of continuity thing, the best is when you do it, but like in a more modern way. And this didn't feel modern at all. So, so we'll see. But it's, it's, it's interesting. It's only a year. Usually people get a little more time than that. So, I think there was a lot more going on behind the scenes that we don't know about and maybe never will, but I'll try to find out. Yeah, I was just, just for context, because I found this interesting. Tom Ford fashion on the last Xenia earnings, it did 65 million in Q124, 65 million euro in Q124. Tom Brown was almost 80 million euro. So, and then Xenia is almost 300 million euro. So, like in terms of the fashion portion of this brand, it is still quite small. And that makes me wonder, like, obviously, when you see a brand that's at that scale, you start thinking growth, well, the potential, you know, the name recognition, and we can make it so much bigger and what have you. I wonder if they just thought, you know, maybe we should be focused more on expanding through the categories where we already have success and maybe that's leaning further into menswear. Who really knows? But I will be curious to see how far they can actually take that fashion portion of it. Because as you said, it really ultimately, like the Tom Ford beauty business is what is driving, that's where the money is in this whole thing. Yeah, I think Xenia has a lot riding on this from, they are building out their portfolio. Tom Brown has been very successful. But when you think about it, that's exactly what I wrote, like Tom Brown is way lesser known than Tom Ford. Like, yes, my dad, he doesn't know what Tom Brown is, no offense, Tom, love you. But like, my dad doesn't know, my dad definitely knows who Tom Ford is, I think. But, but like, yeah, it's interesting. There are two ways they could go. One is they, the one thing that the release said other than having was that they are going to announce a new creative director. So they could go the route of like, let's just do the patterns we have and do suiting and have a designer sort of update them and focus on the menswear and the shirting and the ties and all that stuff and let it ride, or they could really try again. And so I think, you know, I think like, I don't know how involved Tom Ford is in this actual decision, but I think he probably does have a bit of influence over this. And I think they're going to go for it. I hope it's someone really cool and fun and that this is a great new chapter. And honestly, whatever happened with Peter Hawking's, I feel bad for him and like the situation, like, it doesn't matter how difficult he was or all the tension and all that stuff, which like every designer has tension with the rest of the company. That's just how it works in this business. But, you know, it's a bummer, like you work somewhere for 20 years and you get this big chance and you, you bomb. And that is, it's just hard. Like this is a talented person. So wish him the best of luck. And I hope he starts his own thing. Like I think actually if he, he's the person, you never want to tell people to start their own brand. Like he's a person, he should start his own brand and show what he's really about and develop it. And you can do that in London. He still has access to tailoring and all of that. And he has the resources and the connections. And I'd be interested to see what he would do for himself and who he really is because I don't think we got to find that out in the past year. Jacob, this was so fun. This was great. Really happy to be back. I'm back in New York for a while now until the DNC. So I'll be around reshifting my brain back to looking at fashion stuff. Great. And are you, is Ralph Lauren and the Hamptons men's and women's or just women's? No, it's sadly just women's. So I will not be making that trek. Okay. Well, I'll, I'm sure I'll see you that week though, but we'll talk before them. Sounds good. Thanks, Lauren. Thank you.
