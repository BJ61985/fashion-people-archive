Happy Friday, everyone. Today is finally stories of the season day, our big awards season event taking place tonight right in Hollywood. I am interviewing a bunch of costume designers about what they do and how they do it, including Colleen Atwood, who this year did Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Janty Yates from Gladiator 2, Virginie Montell from Emilia Perez, and of course, Jonathan W. Anderson from Both Challengers and Queer, which I saw this week. Very excited to dig into it with all of them. I am just one of many attractions this evening. What I'm hearing, author and host of the podcast, The Town Mat Valeny, will be chatting with Dune director Denis Villeneuve and Nora Star-Mikey Madison. Peter Hamby is interviewing Zoe Saldana, Jeremy Strong, and Peter Sarsgaard about acting, and Baratundi Thurston is interviewing an amazing group of documentary filmmakers, including Matt Terenauer, who many of you probably know from the Valentino doc that kind of made him famous outside of the Vanity Fair world. Very exciting. I'm super pumped to listen to all the other chats. And big thanks to our sponsor, Polestar, for carting me around all day. I have almost bought a Polestar several times, so maybe after this experience, I will. And also, if you are in town and want to join us and you're in a guild or you're my friend, just email fritzapuck.news. We really don't have that much room at this point, but I just want to make sure everybody who can come to this comes. And if you're not in town, I'm sure we're going to release a lot of this online at some point. Line Sheet was crazy this week. We have Estee Lauder. There was a big, Alexandre Arnaud got a big, big promotion on Thursday. So on Thursday, we really dug into that. I also had some W Magazine, W Media News. They acquired another very iconic magazine. I'm not going to share what it is now. You have to subscribe to Line Sheet to check it out. But very exciting stuff. The news never stopped. Burberry shares shot up 22% on Thursday after Josh Shulman said what he was going to do with the company, which is essentially sell scarves, knits, and coats, which is what he should be doing. So much other stuff happened too. I don't even remember half of it. Phillip Lin left his brand. Peter Doe left helmet laying. It's all in Line Sheet. So check it out. And I hope you enjoy this conversation with Emily. I'm a big fan of her newsletter. And, you know, we could have probably talked for two more hours about other stuff, but we got into it. I am looking forward to your feedback. Emily Sunberg, welcome to Fashion People. Thank you. I'm so happy to be here. I'm so happy you're here. So first question on the Friday show. What did you have for breakfast? I did have breakfast this morning. I don't always. I wake up early and then I usually have a lot of coffee, like half coffee, half creamer is my sweet spot. And then I get this yogurt from the farmers market and I have that with a bunch of peanut butter in it. Sounds delicious. Yeah, it's great. Is it the yogurt with the mustache on the label? Or it's not. It's, it's from the, the, I like the weird, the the over at the better for me. So like the jar has the name of the cows. Great. Great. The guys from like Amish country. Great. But the farmers market near my house, it's just in like a clear plastic container. Oh wow. So it's really mysterious. Really mysterious, really tangy. Yeah, it's good. So I'm excited to have you on because you're sort of a fashion person and sort of not. And you cover a lot of different industries. And let's talk about who you are and what you do. You are celebrating two years of your letter, as you like to call it, feed me. But before that, you did a lot of different things. How did you get to sub stack and, and become one of its big stars? So over COVID in the summer of 2020, I started writing on sub stack. I was mostly using it for writing short fiction. I was writing scary short stories. I was living at my ex boyfriend's house in Beverly Hills and kind of freaked out by the whole world as everyone was. And the platform was different than it was now. There wasn't the same sort of news feed features, comments weren't as explicitly a feature of sub stack. It was really just, I was deciding between newsletter platforms and there was Mailchimp, there was sub stack, there were a few other ones. And I didn't have a lot of Instagram followers at the time and I just started playing around with writing on it. Then about a year later, I wrote this scary story about a girl boss who kept all of her employees in the basement of her brownstone apartment and Matt Levine from Bloomberg linked to it in his newsletter. And a bunch of my friends were like, Hey, you're showing up on my Bloomberg right now, your sub stack is on it. Like my friends who subscribed to the letter and work at Bloomberg. And that was, I think the first time I realized the power of newsletter traffic in a delightful way. Like historically, when I had worked at the Cut or, you know, I worked at Great Jones, which was a cookware startup. And even when I worked at Metta, newsletters were always an annoying task for someone to do. It was sort of like put a bunch of content in there. We just have to do it. We don't have any major traffic goals through it. It's just another way to try to get our traffic out. And that was the first time that I was like, Okay, people scroll all the way to the bottom of this letter there, it's broken up into different areas. And it's, it drove a lot of traffic. And then a year after that, I was still playing around with the letter publishing essays, and I guess some short fiction. And I was working at Metta and they announced that they were going to layoffs. I knew that my team was going to be affected by that because we spent a lot of money. And at that point, SubSac was becoming clearer as a place where people could write and make money and sort of create these little publications that had devoted followings, not big followings, but devoted ones. And you could sort of self sort what kind of reader you were based on, what newsletters that you were reading every day, and how you were talking about them. So I was sitting in my office at Hudson Yards, where Metta was at the time, and I was looking around at everybody spinning in their chairs, and I was looking at my phone at all the different group texts that have sort of had sort of been created in my life at that point. And everybody was really excited about workplace gossip. It was like everyone was talking about layoffs and fundraising and startups. And my friends, like from bartenders to billionaires, were interested in that sort of stuff. And I was like, I'm going to start a newsletter and I'm going to charge money for it. And I'm going to see what happens. A few weeks later, I got laid off for Metta. And then a few weeks after that, I wrote a story for New York Magazine about shoppy shops, which was a story about retail. And a lot of people found my newsletter from there. And I could tell that they wanted me to, they wanted to read more stories like that. But from day one, it was paywalled. From day one, it was daily. And I was writing to nobody for a long time. And then it slowly started to take off. Just rewinding for a minute. What did you want to be when you grew up? Did you want to be a journalist? Did you want to, what was your sort of, as a teenager in college, what you thought your path would be? Because what you do now didn't exist then. Really, it sort of did, but not really. Yes, you're right. What I do now didn't exist. Most of my jobs that I've had, I was the first person to have that job. Like when Stella hired me out of college at New York Magazine, I was the Instagram editor for the cut. Like that wasn't a position that existed before. When I was in college, I was interning at Food Network and Yahoo and NBC as like a social media intern. And I was often the first person to have those types of internship roles at these larger media companies. When I was in high school, when I was a teenager, I always was writing, I was always spending a lot of time on my phone. I had an iPhone in like eighth grade. And I was really interested in the way that this little computer was playing a role in my life. My dad was a teacher. My mom is an artist. And computers were always a big part of our lives. So I spent a lot of time online. And I was really interested in social media and meeting people online and expressing myself online. So I don't think I went, I went to FIT not with the goal of working in fashion, but with the goal of going to a state school in New York City. And I wanted to work immediately. Like I worked in social media because I knew how to use it. And that was what the companies needed at that time in 2013, 2014, 15. So I guess when I graduated college and I was working at New York magazine, I thought maybe I would have a job in social media long term. And I sort of do, like I still sort of work in the social media industry. I just get to write about it instead of scheduling posts every day. But I didn't have like a, I wasn't like the kid in class who was like, and this, a lot of kids in my class at FIT said that they wanted Hannah Wintour's job, or they wanted to work at Twitter, or they wanted to work in comms at Chanel. It was always more about the phone to me. It was always more about like, how do I make cool things for people's phones? How do I build ways of communicating with people through, through the iPhone? Did you have personal blogs or how when you were using the phone in high school, like what were some of your, did you have many? Because I think a lot of people had, have had many, like, did you have Tumblr? What were some of your things you had? I spent a lot of time on Tumblr. And then in college, I don't really talk about this a lot, for no particular reason. It's just like a weird thing that I had. I started posting about, I had an Instagram account dedicated to food photography. And I quickly met people who worked at Instagram and Bon Appetit. And people who worked at the New York Times, like I got my social media internships because people could see that I built an Instagram account of like 20,000 followers in 2013, 14 posting about food. And at the time, I remember people in college being like, but Instagram's for people. Why are you posting photos of food? But I ended up meeting somebody who worked at Instagram at the time who introduced me to Stella Bugby, who she knew. And then she hired me to work there. And then like working at New York magazine really shaped so much of what I do now. That was when Adam Moss was still there. And the editors were so great. And I had never worked in a place that was that savvy and cool. And I'm really grateful for my time there. But yeah, I was posting a lot on Tumblr, I guess, and then also seeing how people around me in New York City especially young women were building out things like we were what or man or pillar. But that was not something that I could see myself doing. But I saw people doing that. Yeah, you saw them being entrepreneurial. So looking back at New York Mad, what did working there teach you about being an editor? Because especially when Adam and Stella were there, like, there are a lot of lessons that I learned just from reading it. What did you learn that you think sort of seeped into what you do with Feed Me? I think the way that they thought about, like from a layout perspective, like data visualization and lists and how a list could be just as powerful as a 3000 word essay in terms of traffic and cultural relevance. Like that was super exciting to me. Even I remember babysitting in high school and looking at the families, like the approval matrix in the back of their issues and being like, this isn't something in my house, but this is something in their house. And this is something that I haven't interacted with before in a magazine format. And then when I started working at New York Magazine, I saw that permeate into so many other things that the cut was building out and how they thought about stories. But there was also so much humor even in the office between the women working at the cut at the time. And they were so quick and witty. And I was so used to like this earnest version of women's journalism that to be around people who are a little bit quicker and sharper and snarkier and like your humor could almost get you further than like your resume. And I loved seeing that in action. Yeah, our RIP, I want that bitch's life. Best column ever. That was so fun. Like seeing even even seeing like, oh, you can say bitch, like that's okay. Like watching that happen. And then and then the cuts Instagram comment section became such a good source for information of how people were receiving what the cut was putting out. And then we could build out columns based on that and then sell those columns to advertise or based on that. And just there was a lot of openness. And then obviously being there in 2016, it was like Weinstein, Trump, Haley and Justin, all getting the same amount of shitty media men lists shitty media men lists, Caroline Calloway, all being treated by editors with the same amount of thoroughness and attention. And there was a hierarchy, but unfamiliar like Pete stories that didn't seem to have any obvious threads between them were treated with the same amount of care by editors and attention and thoroughness. And that was cool too. Yeah, that's very rare in this business. I'm curious what you thought of their recent media power list, which as I think you know, I said, I am very shocked they didn't speak to you. And I think it was, no, I think it was like a big error in in their judgment. I know that they were sort of taking one person from each platform almost, and they had Allison Roman, who is great and and has, you know, a lot of really interesting insights from everything she's been through in all the world she's lived in. But I did think it was like, they should have talked to you. I'm curious what you thought of it overall, because I think it says a lot about what's wrong with New York Magazine right now, that package. I loved that package online, but holding it in my hands was such a great example of what you get from print media that you don't necessarily get from scrolling. And as far as the content in it, I mean, yeah, we're all curious who those anonymous sources were. I was really frustrated that they even included anonymous sources. I obviously was really happy that I was named in it. I'm aware of who on that list subscribes to feed me. So I know that a lot of people read my newsletter. I think that the whole landscape of newsletter businesses right now is so exciting. What did I think about it? I mean, it was so fun, like everybody took it. That's like media drama is so exciting. There's a reason why Puck just started the grill room, right? Like you guys cover it so well and with so much attention, and you're realizing that, I mean, you've long known, I'm assuming, that people outside of your industry care just as much about it. It was interesting seeing that whole media list come out, I guess, in the wake of like, or I guess, alongside the election. I mean, what did you think of it? I think, as I said, it underscores what's wrong with New York Magazine now, which is really good idea. I'm a huge fan of Charlotte's. I think she's like a superstar who's going to become a bigger, bigger star. She's great. Really big fan of her and her reporting skills. I think the execution was not right. And so like the fact that to me, it looked much better in print, I agree. They should have figured out how to make it look good on the web. Not many. I messaged Charlotte like that day and she was like, oh, check it out in print. I was like, I will when it comes in two weeks to my house because it takes two weeks extra for it to get there. And like, I'm not going to Larchmont to get the magazine. Someone from Vogue is sending me their new issue because I'm like, there is no magazines and you go to Whole Foods, there's like two magazines in LA. Anyway, and I also think that like what you were talking about the way when you were at New York Mag, everything was sort of on the same level in some ways of like, they treated every story with the same respect. I don't think that that happens as much there anymore. And I think that's one of the reasons I love working at Puck because everything is treated with the same sort of reverence and respect. And that's why it works so well. I think like the idea is right, the intention is right, the execution is not where it once was. And that I think has to do also like, they should have had someone from Vox Media. I mean, like Portnoy should have been on it. Yeah, like Barstool is in the ears of like, I think maybe they asked him, I don't know. I also think like the people from Dear Media, if you go to up to a young woman in the West Village and take out their headphones, that's probably what they're listening to. It felt very old guard. And I know what people my age are listening to and reading and you know, like I think Adam Faiz is doing something interesting in terms of video production. He was such a big part of the Harris campaign and their social media. So I mean, the idea was, you're right, like the idea was really good. I also sort of wish that they slow rolled the release of that story. I think that there were so many pieces of it. It would have been interesting if they broke it down. Like I bet Rachel Carton has a really good take on that in terms of what they could have done with even social and teasing it. Yeah, so I mean, A for effort, and I'm glad they did it. It was, you're right, it was super fun. It's fun to, I sent that one, the Condé quote to one of our mutual friends and said, was this you? I didn't get a response. I think it might have been. And then I'm sure they texted you about something else the next week. Yeah, it was like that. There's only a few people who that could have come from and I think we both know who said it. But yeah, like I thought it was great. It just like to me, I didn't write any that when it came out because I was like, I don't want to be a Debbie Downer in this state. But it did. I was like, Oh, but the thing is, this is what's wrong. And I do think like, God bless Joanna Cole's huge fan love her. Like that is not the future. And yes, interview her, but also like all these people that you're talking about, like talk to them and talk to, it just felt like the mix was not exactly right because there wasn't someone thinking big picture in the right way. So anyway, that's my armchair criticism of New York magazine and and box media in general. But, but I'm curious for you. So when you're thinking about the thing that I like about what you do is you have a good sense of people, what people want to read about. And that is something that like most people who work in media at this point, don't know. They see, they look at traffic and they think this is what is performing well, whether that's conversions on subscriptions or page views or social media likes or whatever. And all that stuff's really important. And I am pre social media, but my first job out of school was in audience development, which was like social media before it existed. So I did that for a year before I became a full time reporter and I've always been like very driven by stats. I look every single day, I think about it. But I also understand that like sometimes a very little story that only a quarter of your readership looks at is actually important for the overall brand and the overall like sentiment towards what you do. And I think that you're really good at that. You just write about the stuff that it seems like interest you and that ends up being really universal. But how do you like from the time that you decided I'm going to do this like business workplace newsletter to now two years in, how has the daily grind evolved and how does what you put in like how do you choose what you end up writing about? Yeah, so as far as choosing what I write about, it's honestly like you could call it gut, you could call it pattern matching and like data analysis, you could call it like seeing what resonates and then trying to replicate that over and over and just developing your own algorithm. But gut is like the easiest way to say it. And then you know, like I spend a lot of time out in the world, like that is how I originally was able to find stories. It was like going to parties showing up to events that I was invited to like that first year. It was a lot of time making connections, making relationships with people. And now I don't need to go to everything because I get a lot of inbound pitches, which is great, which is, you know, that's how so much of your business works as well. Like if I had something like some great intel, I would text it to you, not a bunch of other places, because I know how you're going to deal with it. And I have a lot more inbound specific stories that are coming my way. I think the way that I scan the internet is slightly different. I would say probably year one, I would be scared to report on a flamengo on the loose in East Hampton today. It's like, okay, maybe I have X amount of readers in the Hamptons, but I know how people are going to react to this. Where in year one, I also was reporting a lot more on like economics headlines and stuff from Bloomberg. And it's like people who want to read that aren't reading that on feed me. They're reading it on financial newsletters and financial websites. So I don't need to try to like beat Bloomberg at their own game or like, yeah, I don't need to do that. So I've reduced certain areas and then I've also brought on some contributors this year, which has been really fun, who have all been readers that were just super active and kind of people who I've connected with because of their specialties, whether that's, I have this guy, the anonymous transit expert, who's a suit in an office downtown, who basically is helping me build like a modern metro desk. He can write about why the Staten Island is free in a much better, funny way than I ever could attempt. And then I have a guy that's writing about tech and Hollywood. And then I have another, I have another funny, semi anonymous person who's doing restaurant reporting. So that's changed. I didn't, a year ago, I didn't have somebody to call and be like, Hey, you should write about Balthazar on election night. Now I can do that. Do you think that in terms of restaurants, that's the, I'd say the area that I am most appreciative of, like your, your coverage of that beat, because I used to be a huge, I honestly consumed either more than any other, not to like totally dunk on box media, this entire thing. But like, it used to be, it was literally my number one thing for 10 years and not be, I mean, I do love going out to restaurants. And when we lived in New York, I was a big restaurant person, but it was more, I just loved the mix of gossip and insider info. And then it really just, you know, during COVID got like extremely woke in, in the most negative way possible. And also, they just stopped covering stuff incrementally. Have you found that there are a lot of people who come to you for the sort of restaurant world stuff? Like I always bring up, if when you come up in conversation, when the carbon guys got private equity money, I know that Bloomberg broke that, but like, you're the place that I would go to for that kind of info. It doesn't matter who breaks it. It's you're, you're really the only sort of business outlet with a personality that would cover something like that. Somebody texted me this morning that catch LA closed and that carbon is taking over that spot, which is going to be the first carbon, or the first major food group restaurant in California. But like, he didn't need to text me, but he knew that like, my readers will take that and run or not. It's just a funny place to read it. I don't know if there's anywhere else that has reported that yet. I also love restaurants and I love food and I've written for Grub Street a bit. And I think that the state, so you're right, like after COVID, everybody had to be really nice and nobody could criticize restaurants because they're small businesses and they all had to do well. But restaurant criticism is an art and it's a really fun one, because even if you know that you're never going to go to the grill, like you're curious about who's spending time in there and spending money in there and what shoes they're wearing and what they're, what you're overhearing and the state of restaurants in New York right now is really frustrating because it's almost impossible to get to like a hot table, like for the average person, if you don't have a PR contact or some sort of feature on your resume that like super feeds you to the head of the line or something. So I think that sometimes you can get as much pleasure reading about a restaurant as you would from eating there in some cases. And I think that the right people who write about restaurants are really just writing about the people inside of them, which is what this Balthas are on election night one was like, it was about people doing drugs in the bathroom and like sad bit like fat white guys sitting alone like with Rolex is on just like staring at their burger. Like it's just a great, especially in New York City, like if you can't find something exciting to write about in New York City, I believe this on like you're probably not a good writer because I could walk outside and find something restaurants just happen to be like concentrated anthropological studies of this city. As an expert on the private members club, boom, you did a great piece for GQ. What do you think about I went to the new, what's it called the Kyle Hatchkes Carone place? Shea Margot. Yeah, I went. How was it? I heard you mentioned it the other day. I want to hear more about how is the food? It's fine. Like, look, it's John George. It's like going to Mercer kitchen or whatever. It was fun. I had a great time. It's not like the thing I would normally do on a Saturday night. It's more of the thing I would do on a Wednesday night with people, other people who would be paying. How full was it? Like what percent? It was really full. And the other thing was like when we left, my husband saw some random person he knew. I wasn't really looking around, but then I saw Nell Diamond was there and we were DMing about it. And she was like, I live right around the corner and obviously San Vicente bungalows is going to be right there too. I thought it was super fun. And it will be a place where like it's great for events. It's great for, I don't know how all these different places sustain. Like I don't know how much it is. I think it's like 1500 bucks to be a member there because there isn't anything you can't like work there. Yeah, there's not like a gym. There's not like a, it looks like you walking into like Annabelle's in London meets Twin Peaks. Like there's a room that feels very Twin Peaksy. And so it's like really, really opulent and dark. There's no windows. It's all red lacquer. Where the bathroom's cool. Is it like a selfie worthy bathroom? You know, I didn't, I don't think I went. My friend said Martha Stewart was there the other night. It's exactly the kind of place she would go. It was super fun. But do you, like what do you think of that whole thing? When will it start to fade? Do you think it has like more five years? So the thing about Shea Margo is that Soho house is also right there. San Vicente bungalows is also right there. But don't you think no one goes to Soho house anymore? Right? Other than to work. I think some people do. It's not people we necessarily know. Yeah. I haven't been to Soho house other than in Chicago. Like the tertiary, secondary and tertiary city Soho houses are great. I haven't been to the Soho house in LA since probably 2018. Yeah. And then there's also that one in Malibu, right? That one I think people go to, but the one in less Hollywood. No. I occasionally will spend my day working at Casa Trippariani, but it feels different since everything happened with Eric Adams. No, I really like their gym and they have a sauna. I love that place. Yeah. It's cheaper than Equinox. One day they're going to hear one of these and be like, you can have the lawnmere anymore. Oh, I think it's fabulous. I love the design. It's kind of far, I guess, for some people, but I guess everything is down there now. I like it a lot. Yeah, I like it too. And what I say is like, it's nicer than my living room. And if I sit there for a few hours during the day, it's nice to be in a big, beautiful space and like order coffee or people are down to have meetings there, which is also fun. Okay, so you got those ones. You have San Vicente bungalows, which I keep hearing is going to be really hot for like the gay scene. And then the 22 is opening near Union Square, which I guess is a club in London, but the women from rafts are doing the food and everybody loves their food. So it's like, I think some of these places will win on the daytime working food thing. Some of them will win on the nightlife thing. It sounds like Shea Margo also has a dancing element to it. That's possible. I didn't see that. I could see people dancing on the tables. Yeah, okay. That's fun. It was fun. It's really fun. They were really sweet. I think that these are just going to be more normal that people are spending a few thousand bucks and maybe go four times a year. And if that's the case, then that is great for, then that's like a somewhat sustainable real estate business, right? I just don't know what happens when you join so many that you're not loyal to any. And then like I'm hearing zero bond, like when you start hearing that there's like cracks in the paint and things aren't being restocked and they're running out of things. That's when you like people don't have patience for that. Who are the investors in zero bond? Is it just a bunch of real estate people? I forget. Or was it some club promoter? I mean, I think like Scott Sartiano did it with a group. It might have been a catch guys. Got it. Okay. Yeah. I mean, I went there once with the publicist Alison Broad, who I don't know if you have you interacted with her at all? At AVPR, right? Yeah. So she was when I moved to New York in 2000, at the end of 2005, she was like very important publicist. You would imagine everyone in the office being blonde and wearing pink, a little known fact for all you fashion people, Cindy Krupp, who runs a PR and influencer firm for the, she's run it for like the last 20 years and used to do jewelry PR at Barney's because that was a huge part of their business was actually business partners with Alison Broad. And then they broke up and the, if you know the two people, you can't even imagine that they ever worked together. It's so crazy. But I had drinks with Alison like, oh, I think it was probably October, 2021 at zero bond. It was early. And I swear to God, I was like, am I in 2007 right now? Because a, she has not aged. She looked exactly the same. There was like, Ariel Charnes's husband came over to say hi to us. Like those stuff we were talking about, she told me I didn't look like a fashion girl. It was just, I was like, I truly am back in 2007. And so it's just, I think it's so much of this is, is cyclical. But also you're right about the reservation thing. Like someone said that to me about SVB that a, look, I like, I'm not a member, but I go there all the time because a lot of the people that I have lunch with are members. But also it is annoying to have to get reservations. I'm lucky. I know PR people, I sometimes ask for a favor or whatever, I try not to do it too much, but occasionally, or we just go eat at the bar, like you can still sneak in. But it is crazy how impossible it is in New York. I like, I don't know who all these people are going out to eat. Yeah. I mean, when you look at the reservation system at a restaurant, like you go to the Rezzi for corner store, have you heard of this new restaurant corner store? That's the one that Taylor Swift keeps walking out of? No, but where, where is it? I, it doesn't seem like a place. Where the old dose Caminos was on Houston, Houston, Houston. Oh, okay. On house. Oh, I know it though that dose Caminos clothes. I know. It's interesting. It's fully booked for the next month. And I can't recall a recent restaurant opening that has had the same fanfare as this restaurant corner store. So people are calling it like the downtown polo bar. I mean, it's very much not, but um, yeah, I mean, I, I always love some wilted spinach or some five cheese pizza rolls with pepperoni, jalapeno, hot honey and ranch. Yeah. But like, this is not, you can definitely go to Balthazar and get a very similar, not the pepperoni rolls, but you can definitely get like a steak free and oysters and not wait and not be booked for however long. Oh, they make a table side martini. Yeah. Okay. I'm definitely going next time I'm in town. I think it's like a dinner and a show. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's very funny.

Out of all these different industries that you cover, how do you think the fashion industry is different or is it different? Like are the characters in all these different industries like basically the same and it's just different clothes or is the fashion industry different from food or CPG or entertainment from your perspective? I think fashion people, however you want to define that, really make the culture in a specific way. And then we've now seen founders and a lot of other industries follow the fashion playbook to launch their X brand. Like Melanie Masterin is not building a brand that looks like a soda brand. It looks like a fashion brand. Melanie is the founder of Gia G-H-I-A that is like non-alcoholic spirit slash low sugar soda. That's very good and is the prettiest color ever. And every time I go to a restaurant, I'm like, oh, I want wine that color and it's actually Gia. So I'm like, I need to get some vodka in there. And it's a great mixer. She's built a really beautiful brand with the help of a lot of people who have worked in the fashion industry. So I think that they're, because I write about consumer brands a lot, beauty, CPG, you know, sometimes home stuff or, you know, hospitality, whatever. And I think a lot of those brands are feeling more luxurious and exciting because they're hiring people on their marketing teams who came from the world of fashion. And I think another way that writing about fashion for me differs is like, I know so many people who are excellent at writing about fashion because they've dedicated their lives to studying these references and designers. Like I wouldn't try to write about a runway show if I knew, like I wouldn't try to write about a runway show period, but I know that you're going to cover it a certain way. Amelia Petraca is going to cover it a certain way. Like I don't really write about trends in the same way that somebody like Laura Riley at magazine on SubSack does. But also, I guess another big way that the world of fashion differs is that it's not even like a walled garden. It's like a labyrinth. Like there's so many layers to getting to the kingpins of that industry. And I respect that because I've worked alongside them. But that doesn't mean I'm not curious about how a campaign comes together or the marketing side of things. Or like I was covering the show industry for GQ. And I'm writing about the show, but like I know who to call to write about the fashion. I can't identify the style of shirts that these guys are wearing in the office and how probable or improbable it is that they're wearing them. But I can call somebody like my friend Louis Cheslaw, who writes about that, or Chris Black, or somebody who has a really great perspective on these things, whose quotes would make a really interesting story. And then I guess when I do write about fashion, I also kind of know my lane. Like I'm from Long Island. I grew up in the city. There's a reason why I wrote about this idea of like corporate fetish for a while earlier this year when I saw every single fashion was doing a campaign that took place in like an early 2000s office. And that's because like I have a lot of bridge and tunnel in me. And I grew up kind of seeing this world but not being a part of it. And I do have a lot of thoughts on that. And that's authentic to me where like breaking down the bohemian, clowy runway pieces isn't going to be something that I'm going to properly be able to cover. Yeah. I am curious to know what your perspective is on those on all these teenagers carrying these Trader Joe's bags because Trader Joe bag. So my mother-in-law says Trader Joe. Love. So I'm always where I was like, love you Susan. She'll never listen to this. But she's always like Trader Joe. They all say Trader Joe's bag. So I went to a birthday party for my kid who's three and a half and there were like older girls there. And they were all wearing Trader Joe's bags. Sort of like the LL bean bag but it's it has embroidered Trader Joe's on. Is it mini? Yeah. It looks like the mini LL bean bag like the one Amelia did that Puck does. Do you have any sense of why? And then when we were in New York, we saw more. So this was an L.A. at a party. And then when we were in New York, I was just like, why would you do this? I'm assuming it has something to do with the fact that it's so ubiquitous and so easy to get that they are fetishizing the like low class element of it or what do you think? How old are these girls like high school? Yes, I would say 15. I feel like that is such an easy ask for a parent to fulfill. Like, okay, we're grocery shopping. Of course, I'll spend $15 more on this thing. Sort of like how the Stanley tumbler and I'm curious what Casey Lewis would say about this. But yeah, like the Stanley tumbler is not I don't know how much those are like 40 bucks. Like that's not crazy. But it signals that you've acquired a thing and you identify with another group of people. I'm guessing that that bag is sort of the same. It's like when I mean, you could think you could think about that back to like, when I was in high school, if you were carrying around a vitamin water, your mom bought you vitamin water and sent you to school with it. Like that is a little bit more special than the kid who I don't know, people didn't even really use water bottles as much when I was in high school. reusable ones. But like, there is so much self organization that can happen within the aisles of grocery shopping. And I'm sure your husband also has a lot of thoughts on this too. But I haven't really seen the Trader Joe's bags. That's really interesting. Oh, yeah, they're everywhere. I put it in my notes under sunberg. They're everywhere. I Casey has written about this a lot and everyone should be reading Casey Lewis after school, her newsletter. And she's been on the pod also. But I am fascinated by this idea of like, the rich getting richer, the poor getting poorer. So pretty much everyone in New York City or in Los Angeles is, you know, if you look at it, quote unquote, rich, they're not rich. Like they're all in debt and they're all struggling, but like, they own homes. They have nice lives. Like, and so what do these kids want? And it's different from when we were growing up, when you grow up in the suburbs, the big thing when I'm, I think like a little like a decade older than you. So when I was growing up, the fancy bag to get when you graduated from high school was a coach bag and very few people I knew got them. And I grew up in like a lower middle class area where like, there were probably some kids whose parents made, I remember once overhearing my friend's dad say he made 400 grand. The mom didn't work. Like that couldn't exist now in New York or LA or any other big city where there's a one income household for 400 grand and two kids and they have the biggest house in the neighborhood. So that's like the kind of area I grew up in. Now go back to that same school district and I bet any money that there are kids with Louis Vuitton bags probably bought on the real, real, but they know what it is. Like no one I went to high school knew what Louis Vuitton was. Like it just didn't exist. So there's this element and then you, I talked to my friends with preteen girls who are like, I want a beauty fridge for Christmas and they're buying drunk elephant, which is like 100, these beauty products are 110, $115 a piece. And at the same time, so they're buying all this expensive shit to put on their faces. And at the same time, they're also buying like Stanley cups and Trader Joe's bags. And there's this element of, I just am very curious why people buy the things they buy. And you have a good insight into that because you, as you mentioned, you're out in the world looking at why people spend money. What do you think overall, like not just young people, but what are people buying right now? They seem to be buying fewer pieces of fashion, but you know, that's all relative. I think you're right. I think that the way that people spend money says so much about their different subcultures. I bumped into Amelia at that new store in Carol, Amelia Petraca, who writes a newsletter called Shop Rat. I bumped into her over the weekend and she started asking me about gift guides because everybody on SubSac, we are going to see hundreds of gift guides over the next 20 days. And I was like, I don't know, I'll probably write a gift guide. I don't know. And then since then, so now it's Tuesday, two days later, I have gotten maybe 50 PR emails from people being like, are you doing gift guides? Can you include us in your gift guide? Are you doing it? And it's like this time of year, you really notice how much people think about buying stuff and how much it's pushed on you and how much it's framed and reframed. And you know, I was even thinking this morning before I came on to call you, the areas that used to keep a lot of the lights on at New York Magazine and New York Times were like Wire Cutter and The Strategist. And now there are young people who started writing on SubSac for making hundreds of thousands of dollars in affiliate revenue just because they sort of took that game and reworked it into a sexier, controllable product that they can use places like Shot My and like to know it or whatever to make affiliate revenue. And I just like the idea of reading newsletters every day that are telling you to buy stuff when it used to really be like a few and then increasingly more pages of magazines like I don't know. I was even just thinking about the way that I shop for stuff and I'm so lucky that a lot of brands send me stuff now. And that's kind of most of what I wear. I've never been really into shopping. I like to observe fashion, but I don't necessarily always participate in it. And I'm realizing you mentioned debt. Like there are a lot of people around me who are in massive amounts of debt just by trying to keep up with trend cycles, whether that's where they're eating dinner or what they're buying to wear every few months. So yeah, I think that we're probably going to see a lot more, I guess we're going to see more Trader Joe's bags, but I think we're also going to see a lot more people starting to reckon with the amount of debt and probably trends that they can't afford to keep up with or finding new ways to try to keep up in the, like I was, I walked into Mango yesterday, they have like four different fake barber jackets. So like, I guess ways to participate in trends without actually participating in the real thing. It's hard, but I also get it because you open any publication and you're sort of being pushed to participate in a lot of these trends. And it's the worst for young women who are in high school and, you know, your social life can depend on you participating in a trend or not. Yeah, it's, it's very similar to the way that magazines used to sort of dictate what you were supposed to do and what you weren't supposed to do. And now it's just like constant on the affiliate thing. It's a really good point. And I think what happened at a lot of these big publishers is they started to see the thing that media has not figured out. And I think this was brought up in that New York magazine spread was that you cannot chase these different, it's again, you can't chase trends, you can't chase, you can't rely on one thing. And so the way Amazon does affiliates changes, you're screwed. Like, I don't know if this still exists, but I, at some point, Amazon wasn't allowing affiliates on newsletters. I think that, that probably doesn't, isn't true anymore. That's probably like 10 years ago or whatever. And a lot of these companies were like, Oh, we have this new revenue stream and we are, it's just going to keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger. And it blew up during the pandemic. And then the pandemic was over and people stopped shopping like as constantly. And I have a friend who works at a publisher and their bosses were like, what happened? Why are we going to be down on affiliate this year? And they were like, because people aren't sitting at home for 12 hours a day, scrolling the internet and buying random stuff. And I think it is indicative of bigger issues in how just business operates, the media business as well, but just business operates in general. It's like all about how are we going to increase, increase, increase, increase sales instead of everybody says they're really focused on profits now, but I think it's BS. Like, I think that they are still really looking at revenue bumps rather than thinking about like, how can we have a healthy business that we can exist in 10 years or whatever? Yeah, I think that's right. And I think that's also why sales teams on the advertising side are so cutthroat and so important to especially these new individuals.

So you're here because today is in November 15th is the two-year anniversary of Feed Me and you're relaunching with like a new web design and some news, right? Yeah, I hired somebody. I knew I, so for the past year or so, I've had sort of a bootleg version of the Citibank logo as the Feed Me logo. I was holding on to it because I thought that maybe they'd send me a cease and desist and I would have like a fun letter to post a photo of. I thought Citibank might do that and they didn't. So I was like, you know what? It's about time to sort of have my own reference. I can't reference an existing logo forever. It feels very Canal Street. So I reached out to a designer named Justin Sloan who's based in LA and he's worked with a lot of cool apparel brands but also like a lot of musicians. He did Emily Don Long's logo. He's worked with Prada. He's worked with a lot of more like streetwear brands and I liked how he worked. I liked how his stuff looked. It was a little bit androgynous and I wanted to see what he could make with me and then we sort of, over the past few months, have put together a really fun look and feel to what Feed Me will be going forward. There's a lot of references to early Macintosh logos. There's also a lot of references to 80s automobile logos. The colors are the red and the green are sort of references to the heat mapping on Bloomberg terminals. I think it'll be fun and then on top of that I'm formally introducing my new columnists who I've slowly been introducing to my readers over the past few months but they haven't had like a proper handshake with everyone and then I'm also going to be announcing this podcast that I'm making and it's like a short, I've made a documentary before and I really like that format of going deep on a story over a few episodes. My doc was a short story but so I'm going to do like a three or four episode podcast about, I started recording it before the election but now it makes sense even more. It's about young Gen Z guys in America. Awesome. Yeah, I think more than anything I'm just sort of contextualizing what's happened especially over the past year with the newsletter, how it's grown, how I feel about how it's grown, some stories that have been pretty pivotal for the newsletter in general in terms of traffic but also just how I've positioned myself in the larger sub-stack ecosystem. Yeah, I mean my relationship with sub-stack isn't perfect but I don't think I mean I wouldn't be able to do what I'm doing without it. Yeah, that was going to be sort of one of my final questions is what do you think about the sub-stack revolution slash evolution and it seems to me that it's very valuable in terms of building up an audience quickly. Someone said to me, I think I mentioned this on another podcast, I just keep repeating myself, but that sub-stack is almost like a new version of Twitter where people can sort of say what they want to say. The question is like you have built a business around your sub-stack because you are entrepreneurial, not everyone on there is and like what's the larger in the same way that there were people who became famous out of Twitter and made a business out of it, what's the larger actually was on the yesterday's episode with Kate Young that this came up but what's the larger future of that business? I don't know, I don't know how they become a profitable entity overall especially because they limit the ways you can make money but from your because you're in it, I am only an observer as a consumer and I haven't really dug into their financials to know for sure, maybe they have it all figured out and I don't know. First of all they will love that you compared them to Twitter, I'm sure they will like clip that and send it to their investors for their series C. Yeah you know the lack of an ad network is definitely going to be something that they'll have to overcome. They've been very adamant that they're never going to have a formal ad network and that they really want to grow from subscriber revenue but on top of that I think people are going to get news subscriber paid newsletter fatigue like you get seeing my my credit card bill every month and it's like five dollars five dollars eight dollars five dollars five dollars for all these publications where when I subscribe to a more formal news organization I get all the writers from paying for it so I think that they will probably have to figure out some sort of bundling option as well for that because it gets really expensive if you're curating your news and entertainment and media diet just on sub-stack. The thing yeah I think that it's been really interesting to see how they've tried to make podcasts on their platform work and video on their platform work and they've migrated some podcasters from Patreon over and are trying out a lot of new features like live video but what I'm really grateful for is the community that I've built and the closeness that I've built with my readers through the comment section and the chats and I think the comment section of news sites has sort of been like a lost art from the product teams at a lot of these places like of course the New York Times cooking section is known for having hysterical comments but you're not necessarily recognizing people in there and seeing how you're going to interact with them day after day. Same thing with like chat features often you have to use some businesses I guess have like Slack for their customers and stuff so you can interact there but having those comment sections and chats and then seeing those people at parties I throw and you know meeting them when I'm out in the world has been really rewarding and has built a super dedicated readership and especially when you're seeing them day after day after day because I send daily in the comment section like that's been a really awesome feature of Substack. As far as where it's going I mean we've seen people leave the platform like YOLO Journal left that publication perfectly imperfect left I feel like they might come back Substack does a lot for you you know they provide a platform that people are familiar with and they also allow you to meet people where they're at which is I mean most of my readers their jobs depend on them opening emails so like asking them to open another one every day isn't a big ask of them. I think that we're probably going to see a lot more businesses begin to advertise on Substack as they see the benefits of these super engaged communities so we will see more little if you want to call them like media companies or old school blogs sort of emerged with advertisers attached to them and events and meetups and stuff like that which feels sort of like early 2000s-y which is kind of fun. Yeah I think it'll be like the flip side of it is that they're definitely trying to turn this into a social media company and they want people to give up threads and Twitter or X whatever you want to call it to move over to their platform in their app and we'll see if it works there. I still have plenty of friends who've never heard of Substack so we'll have to see how it how it grows. Sure yeah it does feel like in the same way Twitter I mean I don't think that they should be screenshotting what I just said about Twitter is not successful so it's a shame that people have trouble monetizing audience because you have this really I still go on Twitter even though I'm like why am I still on here? I don't I barely tweet anymore I really have fallen off in the last year but that type of thing is you have this like almost captive audience or willing audience and you're not able to make money off of it it's like the challenge of this era that people are trying to figure out so for you what do you want to do with here's the thing I'm not going to ask you what your five-year plan is because whatever it is is not going to happen like everything changes so much in this world but what do you want feed me to become like do you want to make it a big entity with like a big newsroom do you want to be a consultant do you want to like the place I worked at previously my old boss and the founder was management consultant and at some point you decided to make it a media company and now they do a lot of consulting again it's still a media company but it ended up being you know a lot more about consulting than I think he thought five years into it but what what are your ambitions for it in the next you know in the next phase I don't think I will ever do consulting again I'm not the I'm not the greatest at working for other people who require a lot of organization I wish I was actually debating yesterday whether people were born type A and if that's something I can learn you know what this is what I will say I am not a type A person which literally no one who ever met me would believe that but I am not I do not have good attention to detail I care more about the big picture but the reality is when you work with a lot of type A people you become more type A and you can become more type A like me when from when I was 25 to now is much more than I was then so you can learn it but you know deep down inside that you're actually not one which brings me to the next part of this answer which is I don't like I'm lonely I work alone all day so something that I knew I needed to start doing this year was bring on other contributors to the letter so that's been really exciting for me so I mean Feed Me will always be a daily newsletter I will always be I think for the foreseeable future I'll be writing a daily newsletter on Substack mostly my voice I'll be editing it every day and then occasionally I'll have really interesting contributors some will be recurring some will be one-off things and it'll be hopefully like the most exciting newsletter about the spirit of venture on Substack you know and then like I said I've made movies before I've written magazine stories before I hope to make I'm making this audio project I've been making like these little keychains like I like making things and that could be another documentary or that could be a really great um I kind of joked about it a few weeks ago on Twitter that I want to make like the best box cutter since everybody make gets so many boxes now like I will have a newsletter and then I'll have other projects outside of that that are able to exist because of this successful newsletter that has opened up a lot of doors for me yeah I like throwing events I threw some parties in New York and the Hamptons and LA this year hopefully I will have opportunities to like make some cool investments I have like a bit of a studio mindset when it comes to my work and if Feed Me is like the parent thing on top of all of that then that's great but I don't have a problem as far as the publication goes like handing over the mic to other people who are more talented than me in other ways or more skilled than me in other ways I don't see myself ever taking on outside capital I'm pretty wary of fundraising especially in the media space but I guess never say never yeah I think in year three it's you're just gonna see Feed Me showing up in more places besides sub-stack though well congrats thank you it's really fun to read there's such little that is and I'm excited that you exist thank you thank you it's been really fun and obviously I'm crazy about what you guys are doing over at Puff as well it's really fun thank you it's fun to be a part of the future that's a great way to put it Emily thanks for being here thank you so much oh and enjoy your dinner tonight I know a lot of people who are going oh I think it'll be fun fashion people is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck hosted by Lauren Sherman that's me our executive producers are John Kelly co-founder of Puck, Ben Landy executive editor of Puck, Gaby Grossman director of editorial operations at Puck and Bob Tabadour executive producer at Odyssey edited mixed and mastered by Molly Nugent special thanks to the team at Odyssey including JD Crowley Jenna Weisberman Maddie Sprunkizer Josephina Francis, Hilary Shuff and Kurt Courtney",
