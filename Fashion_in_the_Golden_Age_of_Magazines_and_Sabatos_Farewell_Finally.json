About a week as of right now, Carrie and Gucci have ended their quote-unquote collaboration with Sabato Disarno after a torturous year and a half where sales and profits continue to decline at their profit center. In Thursday's Line Sheet, I share some fresh reporting on how it all went down and who might be next. As I've said before, this is nobody's fault and everybody's fault. I wish Sabato the best of luck. I also wish Stefano Cantino, the CEO of Gucci, the best of luck. It's going to be okay. It really is going to be okay. There's also some weird stuff going down at LVMH that is kind of connected to the Gucci thing. Then I also dug into the whole Kate Middleton fashion gag order, which I find very fascinating. So don't miss it. And definitely don't miss Rachel Sturgatz's chock full coverage of Estee Lauders. It's called a transformation, which included 7,000 layoffs this week. That's a lot of people. Let's get going with Dennis and Cynthia as a massive Liz Tilberis fan. I love chatting with them about their narrative podcast, about her years at Harbour's Bazaar, mostly in the 1990s. And also their observations about how the industry has changed over the last 30 years. Dennis Galanca and Cynthia True. Welcome to Fashion People. Thank you so much. We are so excited to be here. Thank you both for being here. I am so excited to talk to you. I have a million questions. I have a million questions from other people. The first question we ask on Friday, though, is what did you both have for breakfast? Cynthia, do you want to go first? I'm embarrassed to say all that. I've had black coffee. Actually, not black coffee. What am I saying? I've had coffee with half and half and sugar. That's it. That's kind of my breakfast. All right. Well, Lore, I knew you were going to ask this question. So I feel like it cheated. So I had a scrambled tofu with peppers and onions and a side of toast. That is one of the best breakfasts that we've had had reported on this podcast. Really? I've heard a couple of others that I was like, I'm going to go first. I've heard a couple others that I was like, oh, I like that one. He's just he's a disturbingly healthy eater. I try. You know, we are all trying. I interviewed someone else this morning who had her A.G. one, so we got into the vitamins. But we all do our best every day. And you all are doing your best with this podcast blow up, which I am completely obsessed with. If anybody hasn't listened to it yet, you have to immediately. If you care about magazines at all or care about workplace culture and stories about amazing leaders and all that stuff, like this is this has something for everybody. And especially if you're obsessed with fashion in the 90s, it's it's really, really good. And my friend, Carrie Diamond, who worked, she was a beauty director at Harper's Bazaar for many years, mentioned it to me a few weeks ago and said, oh, you really need to talk to Dennis and Cynthia. And she knows that I was growing up. Like that magazine is why I'm a fashion. I love that. And it's why I wanted to move to New York, all that stuff. And so the fact that you all did this, it's so funny because I like I'm literally about to start to cry. And when I talked to Paul Kovacco, the best a few months ago before, before you all launched, he cried. You're going to make us cry. I feel very emotional connection to you all. But let's start with. Tell me a little bit about yourselves and how you ended up. And you all work together for a long time. You're very close friends. You did this past podcast together. So you can decide who says what, but tell me how you, who you all are and how you ended up putting together this narrative series about Liz Tilberis's time at Harper's Bazaar. Well, thank you first of all, so much for everything you've said. It means the world to us. It really does. Den, do you want to start? Well, I'll say this. I love Cynthia and Cynthia lives in California. I live in New York. And during COVID, we were talking quite a bit. And every time I would get off the phone with her, I would want more. And then one day we were speaking and she was saying that she was filling in her husband about Liz and Bazaar and Fabian and that there wasn't a lot of information out there. And quite frankly, Sid, I was like, that's crazy. Of course there must be. No, we do. And then we got off the phone and I Googled it and I was like, oh my gosh, there's really not. And we proposed kind of in that conversation, like, should we do a documentary? Should we do a podcast? And my friendship with Cynthia meant so much to me. And I thought if there is anyone in the world that I would want to do this kind of in-depth project with, it would be Cynthia. And then we just started making some calls. We made a list. We made some calls. And then people just were jumping on right away. Right, Sid? Yeah, I mean, yes, all of that is true. I think that what was really nice, I think Paul Kovako and Richard Sinit were our first calls. And they said, yes. And once we had them, you know how it works, then it was easier to grab other people and and everybody was really very warm to the idea. Because of their love for Liz. But just jumping back a second, Dennis and I met on my very first day of Harper's Bazaar. We met at orientation for all of the assistants. And actually, until we did the podcast, I thought it was also your first day. But he told me recently, no, I had been there a month already. It was just that we met. I was going to the orientation anyway. And I had all these questions at orientation. And he was just laughing at me the whole time. He was like, oh, my God, like the poor HR woman is like, when is this girl going to stop? And I was like, well, I'm here to be a reporter. I mean, I thought they would like that. And anyway, we just. No, they did like it. And I thought it was fantastic. So stupid. It just lines up with your work at this. Anyway, so we became fast best friends. We were roommates. We were always looking for a project to do together. We all we came close to starting a magazine together called Bleach, which didn't go anywhere. But we, you know, we were always looking for a chance to do something together because we're both very entrepreneurial, entrepreneurially minded. And yeah, so I had just been watching actually several of the Vogue docs, which I loved. I think I had just rewatched September issue. And then there was something about the Costume Institute in Anna Winter. And I was really, I just love those. I eat them up. And that was the other thing that was like, well, there's like four or five on Anna and Vogue. And they're great. And I had just rewatched unzipped. And I'm like, how is Liz completely shut out of all of these? Because from what I remember, Harper's Bazaar was ground zero of cool throughout the entire 90s. I mean, Liz was the beginning of 92 to 99. And it just seemed so strange. And like Dennis said, we just started looking like I started checking out YouTube. Obviously, there's books about Fabian. I don't mean that he's not covered. But to see kind of there wasn't much footage. There wasn't a lot of him talking like. And we just from being assistants there, we knew what a very special story it was. And so that's really what happened. Yeah. And it came together like Dennis said, really, really quickly. I had been, I'm a writer in LA and, you know, I do so much on spec anyway, that it was like, why not write something for, you know, why not write six episodes with no money and fund it myself better than another spec script that sits in my drawer? So this and really quickly, Cynthia, you worked in fashion features and Dennis, you worked in the art department. Yes, exactly. I was assistant to Sarah Moer and Laurie James, who were the fashion director and fashion writer. They were, I mean, I couldn't have asked for nicer first. Sarah Moer. I mean, she was incredible. Amazing. She was so cool. And we had a long distance relationship because Sarah was in London. And so I would come in. She really just wanted me to send her a FedEx with all of her cordos the days where, you know, she'd get all her correspondence, maybe a couple of cool little items in the mail. Just pack me up my FedEx box. I'd send it. I'd get a few faxes. She was so nice and just easy. And it was the opposite of what you would think. You know, I was very nervous going in and it was like they were both so sweet. And Laurie James, who was more my day to day person, you know, sat right behind me. She was just amazing. She took me to Bergdorf Goodman for the first time, showed me everything, like introduced me to the suit man before he was famous. Like I just had the best time in the world. So I really wanted to revisit that. And Dennis, who was on your team? And you became a photographer, right? And you do creative direction and stuff. Yes, I started as art assistant. So it was, you know, assisting everyone in the art department, everyone in the art department. And and Bizarre was very much about training people. And so the next thing I know, they promoted me within months to photo researcher. And then I was art editor and I associate art editor. Then I was art editor. And then I became photo editor and then photo director. It took a while because Fabian didn't want a photo editor because he was photo editor, basically. Interesting. And and then as the years went by, I mean, in magazines, the way you get a raise is to get a title change. So inevitably they were like, all right, we've run out of titles to give you. We got to just make you photo director. So, you know, I was like, yeah, whatever. But yeah, that that that was my evolution there. You you all did a really good job of explaining what it was like to work there in in super descriptive. And my best friend is Lea Ternikoff, who's the executive editor of Harper's Bizarre Now. And we've been going back and forth about this. And she was like, you need to ask them. And Cynthia, you answered my question. Like, what kind of budget did they have for this podcast? She has a podcast there. And, you know, I do this podcast and we know how much work and time. And like the the polish of what you all put together is really remarkable. It's just the narrative narrative so good. So you do such an amazing job. Like the story, Dennis, of your Prada suit that you got called in that kind of stuff, explaining and and talking about how like Liz's assistant talking about that last lunch that they that lunch they had together and they had champagne and caviar and all of this stuff. Like it was so it's so rich with detail. But I'm curious, like what what were people like, Cynthia, you said you're the people you work for really nice. I have this growing up like I had a real. I was very interested in Liz because I was interested in the magazine. And I remember my aunt bought me her memoir and all that stuff. I was in high school at the time. I was less interested. Now I'm obviously very interested in Anna Wintour. And I always say it's like been a great privilege of my life to be a reporter covering her because it's so she's so fascinating. But I didn't want to work at Vogue ever. I wasn't like I just didn't care about that. But the impression for people like Leigh and me growing up at that time was that it was like working in a magazine is like a very mean girl environment. What was it like? And like what did people wear every day? Like I know Paul's uniform, but like did everyone wear black? Like was it what? Like what kind of brands did people wear? Because this was before the time where like everyone wore designer clothes. Was everyone wearing helmet laying or was it more like theory or. Then what do you think? What was like the vibe? I would say what I was doing, but I think I was probably a difficult. So you say what you were doing. I you know what? I want to say this about fashion people starting off. I felt so accepted because the fact and this is why to this day I love fashion people. There is no judgment on your sexuality. So my coming into working there, having that sort of embrace of who cares was. It changed my world. Now clothing. Yeah, they might they might judge you a little bit on that. And I certainly was pulled aside at one point and told Dennis, you need to dress better. And Cindy and I joked about this because we thought we were. I mean, I was wearing my Benetton clothes when I worked there. And like this is serving outfit. There's yeah, I was one. I look good. And so I started walking around the office and really observing the men who who worked there. And there weren't many. I mean, you know, Paul Kovac, Richard, Senate, Fabian, Johans, Fentzen, everybody wore black head to toe black. And so I started with just wearing black. And I mean, initially, you know, I was going to the stores and buying like a Calvin Klein T-shirt and, you know, just basic black things. And I was getting by with it. And then as time went on, I started investing a little more money in like, oh, I'm going to buy, you know, a Prada black shirt or pair of pants or whatever. And they would notice people would notice they would come. They would grab your collar and like look at the tag. And I thought, oh, it's got to be a name brand. But to really answer your question, I think each fashion editor, it depended like Melanie Ward, you know, she's wearing helmet like, right? And Tanya Goodman, she's wearing Calvin Klein, but black, you know. Yeah. So. Did were there is there was there as much gifting back then? Oh, my God. Yes. Oh, pretty amazing. I mean, Christmas time was a bonanza. I mean, just nonstop presence coming. Yeah. Is there anything that you remember that you got? Or someone else got is like, oh, my God, I can't believe this happened. They used to send great accessories to Sarah Moer all the time, like really, you know, sunglasses, bags, like stuff like that. And I would obviously send that stuff on what I got a lot of were like big, gorgeous, glossy, coffee table books, like amazing, you know, big, heavy fashion books. And I would take those right down to the strand and get cash to pay my rent. I know it's awful. I mean, it's like all the people in a couple of times, like I was bad. I was absolutely bad, but it was the only way to do it. I mean, you weren't really making anything and you had to, you know, figure it out a little bit. Look, there are a lot and I think they have tried to curb this and there have been a couple of people have gotten fired. But it really in the 2010s, early 2010s, I feel like a lot of editors at those magazines, that was like they considered that part of their part of their income was getting free stuff and then selling it. Absolutely. And you know, the corporations know that and kind of encouraged it, you know? I mean, you know, it was a whole paternalistic thing of like, which all corporations did and probably do still with not paying you a lot. But like you could expense all your meals. You could, you know, take a cab anywhere you wanted with slight excuse, you know, all of that. So it was very like we're taking care of you. So you felt you did it did actually breed a sense of entitlement. Of course it did. And and we were we were bad about, you know, it was also the age of like CDs and then you could like take all the crappy ones over to the thing or whatever. But no, you saw. So I'm sure then you saw even more like crazy looks coming through for fab, huh? Oh, I mean, just I mean, every designer, every designer would send, you know, designer pajamas or, you know, coats or I personally remember getting Jonathan Adler, lots of Jonathan Adler and which I loved. And I still have a lot of it. Yeah, maybe he'll listen to this and send you some more stuff. Oh, I would love that. Oh, my God. But you know, I was making twenty four thousand dollars a year. That was that was my salary, even when I was a photo editor. That was my salary. And I remember one of my tire for friends coming over to my studio and saying, oh, my God, this is how you live. You're the photo editor of Harper's Bazaar. And I didn't know we had an expense account. And I remember talking to Richard one day and kind of complaining about money, you know. And he was like, doll, are you using your expense account? And I was like, what expense account? And the expense account was just unlimited. And that's when I like I learned like, OK, lots of dinners. They'll pay for that. Sure. He's going to love you. You know, they'll pay for that. Well, you know what? They should have been paying so low. No, no, I mean, that's so crazy. When I started, I my first job in New York was in 2005, and I'm my salary is 35. So that's probably 10 years after. Yeah, but it's still like and honestly, those people now probably make sixty if they're lucky. Right. No, it's so much worse now. You know, you yeah, I mean, obviously at the time, we didn't realize we were in the golden age of publishing, in fact, you know, that where, you know, the cars were waiting at the curb for all the editors, you know, that whole that whole world of daily flower deliveries. I also used to steal the flowers because they would change them after one day and they were fine. I'd be like, oh, my God, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't take those. Don't take those. We just yeah, we bring all that home. Yeah, that was another question I had for you. Did you all feel the like this is really special? Yeah. And 100 percent. Oh, yeah, it was the most. And also, you have to understand, like for me, anyway, I was laying on the couch circling ads in the New York Times. And it just said, you know, one ads and it said, Hurst, seeking editorial assistance. I didn't even think about Harper's Bazaar, if I'm being completely honest, like I didn't even know it was still a thing. I don't think I thought it was even being published anymore. So I was just thinking like, oh, OK, Town of Country, maybe Cosmo, please not be read book. But I just went over there for that and then to find out it was Harper's Bazaar. I was like, oh, Harper's Bazaar. So the first day I'm walking in there and seeing like what I'm in the middle of is like. Oh, like I've dropped into an extraordinary situation. But it took me a while to understand the context of exactly, you know, that I had that we had fallen into this like very unusual and cool sort of well, uprising is too strong. But you know what I mean? That's like moment where where Hurst was like, oh, we're back, you know, and just and that we were working with the best of the best. That took a second to sink in. Yeah, I felt like a little celebrity. I mean, I honestly did. I all my friends treated me accordingly. And and we were invited to every single fashion event, gallery opening, you know, all of it. Yeah, so fun. This show is brought to you by Boca, the brand on a mission to inspire more mindful oral care, because when you take care of your mouth, your whole body benefits.

What were the budgets like for the shoots? Like, do you remember what was like an average shoot? Like how much would be spent? Do you remember? I mean, Stephanie Alberton said, said 200. She said 200,000 a page. Is that crazy? No, no, no, no, no, a shoot. A shoot. Okay. Sorry. A shoot. Yeah. Yeah. So if you had an eight page shoot, you're, I mean, it could run to 200,000. So what compared to now? Like the same shoot for a magazine? For a magazine. Uh, 20,000. I mean, honestly, like, no, but I mean, I, I, I'm, that's low, but, um, yeah, it's, it's fraction less than half. Yeah. Yeah. There's no way any of those magazines, even Vogue, they are not spending that on, on fashion shoots. I guarantee you. I mean, do people even go to foreign locations anymore to shoot? Like, is the age of people still go to like Africa or? Yeah, but not as much. And, and that's, you know, I mean, I think that's reserved for, you know, the star photographers, like, you know, I mean, I don't think they're, you know, taking chances as much these days. If you're a younger photographer, I think they're just like, no, you know, okay, you're based in New York. Okay. We have a studio shoot for you. Yeah. But yeah, no budgets budget. I can't imagine budgets for magazine will ever go back there. I mean, advertising campaigns and so forth, obviously still have bigger budget. I just remember Tani Goodman talking about renting an aircraft carrier for a shoot and we were like, Oh my God. I mean, yeah, just to give an idea of what was considered like an acceptable ask, you know, Yeah. And then keep in mind, sometimes you would do those shoots and then they would be canceled and reshot. Oh yeah. Yeah. That was like, I mean, Fabien said that Bazaar really didn't do a lot of that compared to save Vogue, that they were quite conservative. Because Fabien, Fabien could save anything with his graphics, his design. He really would be able to, even if it was a bad photo shoot, he would be able to kind of chop it up or use his graphics on it or, you know, just do his magic. I mean, so we did. Yes, we did not kill a lot of fashion shoots. We really didn't. It also felt like you all were so confident in the point of view of the magazine that like, like you said, you could save anything because the, the fundamental, there was a real idea there. So it wasn't like it was, I know that sometimes you all would go on shoots and just make it up, but like there was like an underlying. Exactly. I think the Fabien and Liz had such a clear vision and along with Paul and Tani, who were really kind of at brain trust for what they wanted to do. You know, I think that there was a great call to Harper's Bazaar's golden era of the 40s, 50s, 60s. It was like astonishingly beautiful and cutting edge. And they wanted to reference that, but I think that Fabien and Liz, particularly also were very conscious of needing to advance it. You know, it's not enough, of course, to go retro. You've got to figure out what is the modern spin on that and how are we advancing that and how are we going to bring this forth? And I just think that they were both, it just feels like it was so well articulated from that first issue that we all sort of, yeah, had a sense of, yeah, they had so much confidence and, you know, that really just spreads out to everybody and also so much joy. Like you just felt like they were really having a great time. You know what else is interesting about photo shoots during that time? Inspiration, like today, a client, a magazine will bring a storyboard and it will be photos from other people or specific. Like we want this lighting, we want these poses, we want this styling. Back then it was, you know, a painting, a Renaissance painting was the inspiration or, you know, a sculpture was the jumping off point. You know, it was so much looser. The other cool thing that Paul mentioned to us about what you're saying, Dan, is that you also had this thing where because there was an internet, you were mixing in someone's impression of a movie. So, you know, let's say that the, you know, breathless is the inspiration, but perhaps probably you hadn't seen it in like 10 years. So the editors are bringing all this other stuff into it as opposed to being able to just immediately reference everything today. So that created, I think, kind of an impressionistic feeling of creating something brand new, even if you were referencing, you know, something else. Yeah. Yeah, I think about that constantly in the imagery that were fed on Instagram or what have you, and a lot of it is from the nineties and the era and a lot of images you all made or amplified. And there, it doesn't feel as original now because people have so much access to all that imagery constantly that it isn't coming. It isn't impression. Yeah. It's, it's just direct. And so I think something is lost in that. Um, or you could say something else has gained if you want to be positive. Yeah, no, but I know what you mean. There's something about being able to reference things so quickly that the imagination, there's no space kind of, you know, or not no space, but it's just a different kind of, um, yeah, it's a real different thing. What brands, I know you all mentioned Calvin Klein on the podcast. We just talked about helmet talked about you talk about Liz's relationship with Carl Lagerfeld, a couple other designers she was really close with, but like, what were the Harper's Bazaar brands? What were you, which were the designers? If you weren't wearing them, that you were just covering a lot. It felt like, right. Prada, Prada, Prada, Prada. Cynthia and I loved APC. We, members said that was a one of the, I mean, to the extent that I could fit in to APC, I did love it. I did hide many of their scarves. Um, I think though that Prada was big, like in terms of something that everyone's wearing around the office and also like the kind of what Liz really loved. Didn't you feel that helmet, helmet laying for sure? Yeah. Chanel. Chanel, Chanel, Chanel, obviously. Ralph Lauren too. And of course, Donna Karen. I mean, that was the other thing is that Donna Karen was such a big thing then. And she was such a close friend of Liz's. And I think she really embodied a certain accessibility that Liz was really trying to go for and frankly, also a certain body, more of a range of body type. To the extent that you could address that back then, I think Liz did in her own way. And then if you were going out, it was Tom Ports Gucci. Got it. I stayed home. Yeah. No. The Donna Karen piece is interesting because I remember seeing her on Oprah and she's saying that she was like a size 11 or a size 13, which like doesn't really exist anymore. Those are junior size. I don't even know if they junior is a thing anymore, but I remember her saying that and being like, Oh, she's a person who lives in the world and it's glamorous and cool. It is not a size two or four or whatever was or six was probably like thin size. And that was true of Liz as well. She was tall, but she was, I don't know what your size, maybe she was a 12. I mean, a normal woman. And she looked really, really chic. And I think that for me at that time, and I'm sure the other young women in the office, you know, it was a big deal. It was a big deal to see somebody like that who was allowed to occupy a high position in fashion without looking with while having white hair and not being rail thin, you know, you, because, you know, you could feel as a journalist like, well, I'm never going to be that. So I'm therefore I'm locked out of all of this. And with Liz, it was kind of like, Oh, no, there could be. And I know that if Liz were around now, she would totally embrace the. The movement toward more, you know, body diversity for sure. Well, more diversity period, right? Yeah.

Speaking of sort of accessibility. When I think of bizarre now and when I was in high school reading this, I wasn't really thinking about like, Oh, these are the prices that they're using. I wasn't, I did read British Vogue at that time I would buy it. And they, that was where I learned about the high street. And that was, there was H&M there before here and all of that. But I was looking at some old Vogue's actually from the turn like 1999, 2000 recently. And there are not, there's a lot of really affordable clothes and there aren't a lot of designer clothes. In the market. Interesting. Like, yeah, it was much more, it was much more like, because the thing is in, at that time, as you all know, these brands were not everyone, it wasn't like everyone in the world knew about Tom Ford for Gucci, or would be trying to buy it on sale. Whereas now if you live anywhere and you live near a sex with Avenue, you might try to, it, all of that stuff has become closer to the consumer who wouldn't typically be in, in that world. Or like, even if you had a good amount of money back then, like wearing head to dough designer wasn't necessarily a, an idea that you would entertain if you didn't live in New York. And just curious when you all were sort of creating the magazine, was there ever talk about price? Was there, was it considered a luxury? Because I know when Glenda got there, they really were like, we are for the luxury consumer, it's a shopping magazine. And they focused on the really, really high end of apparel and things for their market pages, things like that. Was that ever a conversation? Or was it just like, let's do cool fashion. Don't worry about that. What was the sort of, um, I feel like it was, let's do cool fashion, right? Or am I wrong? What do you think, Dan? Well, I mean, I think the fashion editors wanted to do cool fashion for sure. A hundred percent, of course. Um, I think Liz, uh, wanted to, and felt it was important to mix in the, the Jay crew for, for, you know, the lower end items and probably comes from her time at, at British vogue with her more dash than cash actually. Oh yeah. Um, but yeah, she would, would, I don't want to say force people, but highly suggest, um, mixing in even a gap t-shirt, you know, and Tani would embrace that for that matter, you know, uh, they, they weren't necessarily about, I don't think, you know, oh, uh, this is, uh, Tom Ford. So let's use it. I think they were what's, what looks best. And, and, and it was a lot of mix and matching. Whereas, you know, today, a lot of the designers are like, no, no, you use my whole outfit. You do not mix this with anything else. Right. Totally. So true. And I thought you all did a very diplomatic job of covering the Anna piece of it. And I actually said to a friend of mine who works at Vogue, I was like, I really think you should listen to this, not because it's so sensationalist. You can read that New York magazine article from 1999 or the one that you all that it mentioned, um, that Michael did on their rivalry. If you want the like really gossipy stuff. But I thought, um, and I thought Grace did a really nice job to Grace Connington did a really nice job of talking about her relationship with Anna and relationship with Liz. And I actually, I kind of knew they were friends, but I didn't know that it was that it, because I read Grace's memoir. So it must have been in there, but I didn't know to the extent of how close they were, but how did when, when it was all playing out their rivalry and Liz moving to New York and sort of encroaching on Anna's territory. And the, the best thing that I think I've definitely written it about it a couple of times, but this idea that Liz and Anna used to switch off the Met Gala and one would host and the other one would host. And the idea of that now is just so foreign because Anna is the Met Gala. Um, and the, you know, if, if Liz had not been sick and hadn't passed away, like the trajectory of the fashion industry, I do believe would have been very different. Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, Liz would have continued to give Anna a run for her money. No question about it. I think Liz would be the editor in chief of both. I think she would at this point be that now, you know, or the head, the editorial director, whatever Anna's title is. Um, no, it's a, it's a fascinating relationship. Um, I'm sorry. I don't remember exactly what the question was. Well, when there really wasn't one I just lapped, but no, it's fine. But, um, when it was playing out, like, was it something you all were really aware of? It was something that we were aware of others being aware of. It was something that we heard the older people in the office, the more senior people in the office may be talking about a little bit. I can remember sort of hearing a little bit, but other than that New York magazine piece, which of course came out before either of us even started there. Right. Cause so that's in like April or May. And then Dennis and I started in the fall. So, so we were aware of it the way that anybody who read page six in the morning or whatever was aware of it. It was this big, you know, great media story between two really glamorous women. Um, but I did not know until we did the podcast. I don't know if you knew then, but I had no idea about, um, like going back to remember and everything and realizing the fight. I mean, the real like arm wrestle for, you know, they did not want them to get Linda Vangelista, for example, for the cover and to know that Linda kind of bucked conventional wisdom on it and just said, I'm doing what I want to do. And I think for her, it was like, look, if Patrick's doing it, then it's okay for me to do it. And so that whole thing you didn't realize, but, you know, something Grace said about it, which I loved was she was like, Liz loved all of that. Liz was competitive. Liz loved giving Vogue a run for its money. And I mean, what's more fun than some editor telling you, there's no way you're going to get any of these people. And she did. I mean, I think that part of it was a real joy for her and a bit of mischief, frankly. Yeah, I mean, let's face it. Anna is an incredible woman and she's done incredible things. And Liz did as well. They just went about it differently. And I think that was one of the resounding things we would hear over and over again when we would ask the question about Liz, about Anna, you know, people, many of the people we interviewed worked at both magazines. And we would just simply ask the questions. We were open to whatever the answers were. For that matter, even Liz, you know, going into this, we knew Liz was amazing. But, you know, maybe other people wouldn't have had that view. And we were open to whatever direction it went. And it just so happened that again and again, it was Liz was amazing. And Anna led differently. One question for you about Liz, and it's hard looking back now because you remember the good, did you all ever complain about her? Like, was there stuff that annoyed anyone about her? Never. God, never. She was like the Mary Poppins of fashion and you knew it. She was a star. I mean, you know, that's the thing too, is that you would, I'd have some little reason to go to her office to drop off, you know, some copy that my boss had written. And she was so sweet. She'd make little eye contact, pick her head out, give you a little wave. And you just felt like you would, I mean, you felt like you interacted with a star. You know what I mean? She was so glamorous and at the same time accessible. So, no, I feel like she was sort of completely above reproach. And she was funny. She had a way of ducking in and saying something hilarious and leaving. You know, or you could tell she's naughty smoking a cigarette. No, she was just so, so sweet. I mean, there were a few other people there who I found intimidating appropriately. But but she set the vibe. There was there was one time this is how she would deliver a message if she was upset with you. There was one time after she had cancer and she was wearing the wig and her wig maker had simply expressed some interest in a book that was very hard to get. And I don't remember the name of the book, but he loved it. He couldn't get it. It was in one of the libraries and she asked me, will you send a photographer to the library to take pictures of this book and send it to my wig maker? And I was like, absolutely. Well, I forgot. And she came to me maybe a month later into the office and she stood in front of me and she said, oh, Dennis, yes, my wig maker, he didn't get those pictures yet. And I was like, oh, my gosh, Liz, I will take care of that. I'm so sorry. I completely spaced on that. And she was like, OK, you know, you know how people can be when they want something. And I was like, yes, I'll take care of it and walked out. And in retrospect, I think she was probably pissed at me. Like, why didn't you do that? Yeah, I would have been like, why do you do that? Yeah, no, anyone would be or maybe most people would be like, what's wrong with you? But yeah, she would deliver her message kindly, you know, even if she wasn't mad at you. Yeah, very British. I thought the other really great anecdote was the at the end when you're telling this emotional story about when she's essentially saying she's leaving the magazine and Dennis, you were worried because you had done you had given a quote to New York, which to New York magazine, which I was also like, that would never happen now. Like New York magazine would never be calling the photo editor of Harper's Bazaar for a quote on something. And like they tricked me. This is crazy. Tell the story. I'm very curious. OK, so we had run photos of Courtney Love and and she was wearing fur. And it wasn't photos that we took. It was, you know, random paparazzi pictures. Got it. And somebody called me up and she said that she was a photo researcher and she wanted to get that photo. And she said, I just want to confirm that she was wearing fur. And I said, I don't know for sure. I said, but here's the company I got the photo from. Give them a bus. And she said, OK, but I mean, was she wearing fur? And I said, well, I said, if it says that she was wearing fur, I imagine, yeah, she was wearing fur. I was like, but you should probably fact check that. And so the quote went out and said, Dennis Galanca from Harper's Bazaar says that Courtney Love was wearing fur. And it got in. Then I think it was the New York Post or somebody called me to comment on my quote. And that's how I even knew about it. And then it escalated and it got to Liz. It got to Karen Johnson, the managing editor, and then I was pulled in by the art director and people were furious. Was the fury over the idea that you suggested Bazaar had used real fur in a photo shoot? Was that the fury was that I was speaking to the. Oh, period. And at this point, they definitely did not want to speaking to the press because the big secret was we did not want people to know Liz was sick. So really, it was like, don't talk to the press because of that. And so the idea of Dennis talking to the press was like, what is wrong with you? But I was tricked. No journalistic integrity at New York Magazine in 1998. Right. Yes. But it was a funny story in a way. And I thought I did think you all did a great job about talking about Liz's illness. She had ovarian cancer and for a long time and had gone through a lot. And basically the whole time she was doing the magazine. Yeah. I mean, she had the first 18 months to enjoy, I think, about right done something like that, if that and then and then diagnosis. And actually, even within that first 18 months, she was very tired apparently. You would never have known it. You would never have known it. You would never have known. But she says in her memoir that she was feeling tired and weak and, of course, attributed it to starting a new mag, you know, starting this crazy job. So, yeah. So looking back, you all are still in editorial. You're still doing stuff connected to this world in some way or another. When you look at magazines now, I don't know if you even read these kinds of magazines or look at them anymore. But when you think of Liz as a leader, Liz as a visionary, Fabian, the other thing I was thinking about really quickly is like, I could just see Fabian not caring about Vogue at all and just like, which was probably great for you all when it came to the competition because he probably wasn't even looking at it. I don't think he was. I don't think he was at all. But just going back, like, what do you think? And not just magazines, online, everything, because we just think of when we're making things now, it's the medium is almost less important than what you're actually trying to communicate. What are some of the big lessons or ideas that you wish that people would take more inspiration from now when you look at what Liz and you all and Fabian and Paul and Tani created back then? Trust the people you're hiring. Give them free reign to, you know, really create. I think that's one of the big things. People are so insecure. Corporations lead much more these days in all the fashion houses and all the magazines. It's all about money and risk taking is so important for success such as Bazaar. There were a lot of risks taken, and I think people are much more afraid of taking risks today. Yeah, I agree. I think I think Liz was a great judge of character, a great judge of talent. And like Dana said, once those people were in place, she seems to have really let them do what they came to do. And the other thing about it is that everything there was a real warmth. You know, people talk about how spare, bizarre, looked and elegant and edgy, but there was a warmth to it. And I think that was exuded throughout the workplace and then into the book itself. And that, I think, is it something that people were responding to subconsciously? I know I was that I didn't have to feel. Somebody recently said something about like, yeah, you didn't have to feel bad that you're not like married to a Duke. You know, like it was sort of like for there was fantasy, but there was also like we said, accessibility and just a weenus about it all. Even if it was not diverse, you know, because it was the 90s. But there was just that and I love that because someone I think Linda of Angelista said to us, you know, it's not necessary to torture people for fashion. And that was the whole ethos. And I just love that. And I always carried that with me. You know, you don't have to go there to get creative work out into the world. Yeah. Cynthia and Dennis, thank you so much for being here. Thank you. Your support of us, of the podcast, having us on your amazing podcast. Yeah, that's a dream come true. We really, really appreciate it. And yeah, we kind of can't believe it. So thank you. Of course, I really think you guys should do a book. Not that that is. That's interesting. It would cost you even more money, but you should do a book because it could be really in depth and but also visually. We would love to do something like that. What a great idea. Yeah, we would love it. Yeah, that's amazing. I hope you do. Thank you. And I hope I get to meet you both in person sometime soon. Let's make it happen because I'm doing it. I mean, as you know, Altadena, your Eagle Rock. So yeah, all right, when things calm down. And Dennis, I come to New York a lot. Please let me know next time you're here. I know you love New York, so I. Yes, please. Thank you. Thank you. You have a great day. Thank you. Thanks again. OK, bye. Bye.
