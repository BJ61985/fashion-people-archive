It has been quite a month for me, quite a month for you. Thanks to Mel for breaking it all down with me. Mel, Audenberg, welcome back to Fashion People. Thank you so much for having me, Lauren Sherman. It's good to be here. Are we both not wearing pants? I am not wearing pants. I'm happy to say that I'm wearing shorts. What are you wearing? I'm wearing gym shorts with my, we both have shirts on, like collared button-ups. Let's do a quick fit check. I'm wearing a shirt, a husband's shirt and Ron Dorff shorts. Wow. I'm wearing a Charvet shirt, a Uniclo heat tech turtleneck and Amazon shorts. Look at us. It's good. This is actually good too bad we're not recording this. So you're on vacation. Do you want to talk about that or no? We can. I'm on a vacation in an undisclosed location. I really want this fucking phone to, I want to, I want, like in white loneliness, I want them to lock up my phone, but like, I can't. I can't. I know. I want them to. This is my dream. And right now, not only do you have real work, real work stuff, but there's also all these, I'm getting constant texts because there are all these announcements happening today that we're going to get into later. But what a lucky day for me will be on the fashion people podcast is all I say. Agreed. I mean, this is, this is going to become a bi-annual thing for us, I think, like just talking about everything that happened this season, starting all the way in New York, which first of all, do you realize that today, this is going to be published on Friday, March 14th. We started Fashion Month on February 3rd at the Mark Jacobs show. Damn. It's not a long time. It's not healthy. It's not healthy. It's too long. I feel great today, though. I was so psyched by the end, like on Tuesday, Monday and Tuesday, I was like, yeah. Yeah. I thought the shows at the end were actually kind of made me excited about fashion again in some ways, but let's, maybe we should start with New York and we can zip through and then focus on Paris because there was a lot of news and a lot of good things happening. But in New York, what were the highlights for you? What did you, what do you remember from a month and a half ago when it happened? Well, the Mark Jacobs show is definitely the hottest ticket in town and we know that. I really like the coach show. I'm really attracted to real clothes right now and like proportioned silhouette and I thought, I liked it. I like the coach show. You know what? I forgot to ask you as what you had for breakfast. Oh, wait. Hold on. Back up. I had, I had a traditional Moroccan breakfast and a Turkish coffee. It sounds so good. Oh my God. It was amazing. Okay. Back to, back to coach. That's interesting. I'm also interested in real clothes right now. What do you think is happening on the runway? I mean, we saw more broadly, coach wasn't about this really, but coach is always, I feel like about the kids, but more broadly there was this sort of corporate cosplay that was happening, whether or not the clothes, a lot of clothes look like sort of working girl stuff you'd wear to the office, but also there were also just like a lot of shows that took place in offices. What do you think was up with that? Well, people really are like, myself included are obsessed with severance right now. It's just the look of the moment. Are you watching severance? Yes. I am a severance person. I dropped off during fashion month, but I am engaged. Okay. Have you watched the latest episode? No. I got to the episode where they left the severed building. Oh, wow. Wow. Wow. Okay. There's a lot going on. The newest episode is insane. I actually watched it twice and I'm really, really into it, but I think that the, I think that that does have something to do with it because I'm also in calls for ad jobs and they're talking about, you know, it just being, it's just like a thing right now. And I think it works and it certainly works in New York. Oh yeah, that works. And that was very Calvin Klein. Wait, Calvin Klein, sorry, sorry, sorry. Calvin Klein was the hottest room. Mark Jacobs is always forever the hottest room. I love you, Mark Jacobs, but Calvin Klein this time had Calvin Klein. So if you've got Calvin Klein in a fashion show, this guy here is going to be really excited. Like that's exciting. Kate, Kate, Christy, Calvin, that is like the best thing you're going to see in America. And, and, and, and people were really there and people were also very like dressed to be at a Calvin Klein show. Yes. Yeah. And also I thought the like treatments of the carpet and the branding, it all felt like a real and also the interesting thing about that room that Calvin shows in, it's very bright. The lights are extremely bright. I guess you could do them lower, but I think even for the raft shows, I didn't go to all of them, but the, I went to the one with all the popcorn. I did too. And that like, but the, the lighting in the room at the Calvin show was like, it felt like an old school fashion show in the best way possible. You know what, I like it. I like being intimidated. I like being in heavy rooms that are like intimidating and scary these days in fashion. I think that's, I think we don't get enough of that because it's gotten so big, you know what I mean? So big and, and massive and, and in some ways maybe feels like it's for the masses. This was an intense, um, this design, I don't know, it's just like an intense vibe, but I like it. I like it. And I like that everyone was dressed up for it. And I went to look at the clothes and I think there's some really beautiful stuff and I'm looking forward to wearing the jeans and like these like hooded T-shirts that I thought were interesting. And I don't know, it's, I'm interested to see where, where it's going. You know, I'm always going to have a lot of opinions about Calvin Klein because I'm, I'm a child of the night. I'm an American fashion loving kid from the nineties. Like the, the, the like, um, band, the band 1993 shit is literally what formed my aesthetic. That's, that's, that's, that's, that's the end all be all thing. So I'm always looking out and I'm always interested in where it's going. And, uh, I saw some really beautiful things in the showroom in Paris. I think there's also something to say about this, this corporate fetish that's happening that a lot of companies are forcing people to go back to the office finally five years out. And I still haven't read the New York magazine cover story because I'm still in Europe and also New York magazine comes about a month late to my house. Yes, I am openly complaining about that. But, um, I haven't read the thing about like five years after COVID, like what did we learn or whatever. But I think one thing that I'm seeing, I just, I reported on this, Condé Nast is forcing everyone to come back to the office four days a week, but a lot of companies are like finally like, no, you got to come to the office. We got to make it, we, you got to be there. And I think that's part of it. And then there's also this thing of like in the real world, everybody dresses like a bum and they wear like jeans are dressed up now. So there's also this thing that I noticed this time where ever like a lot of designers are making, like you said, real clothes, but real clothes of like what we thought real clothes were 20 years ago or whatever. Yes. Okay. I, when you think about those pens, those like work, let the river run working girl, Melanie Griffith suits in the Calvin Klein show. I am like, I like them. I hate them. I hate them. But then someone was talking to me about why they wanted to work with them. And I'm like, Oh yeah, that's such a good idea. Like they're just that, but that's good. I love to like hate something one day and like at the next day. I, I'm definitely, it's really interesting that you said that because some stuff right now feels too retro to me and some stuff, it really is working. Like, if you flash, flash forward to, to Mew Mew, it's like, I guess it's all retro, but it's so now and it's not lost in all these retro references at all, not one tiny bit of it, but totally. It's interesting because there were so much of what she showed was like pencil skirts and little first stoles and lots and cloche. Is that how you said those hats? Like those little hats 30 from the 30s. Like it, it was very, um, all these, it was like all her little, the way I described it is I felt like Prada was their conversation where he was like, no, you can't do that. No, you can't do that. No, you can't do that. And then Mew Mew was like, well, I'm doing all those things you said I can't do, which was an interesting like they, those two con, those two collections, I think were really in conversation, whereas some seasons, it feels like they're totally different track, but whatever she was thinking about it Prada and going back and forth with Rafa, she extended it there. But the thing about that Mew Mew show was like the boots that she showed were these scrunchie high boots. Those were really modern. So even though it was with this, these like little suits and stuff, there was something super to make you remember that we're in 2025 in every single look. I mean, they did that. What you said, Lauren? What I said. What you said. So I went to London for the first time and since 2011. And I only went to a few shows. I went to Simone Rochelle, which I thought was really fabulous. Amelia Wickstead. And then I also went to Burberry, which was great. As a stylist, like how do you shoot something like that Burberry collection? This show really interests me. And I feel like this is what in my mind Burberry should look like all the time. I agree. I really like it. And I was like, yeah. I think he nailed it. It was, I think he nailed it too. I'm looking at it again right now. I think it's, I think it's easy to style people and stuff. It's like, it's versatile. It's giving what it is. It kind of really sets the tone well for the season. It's like really about autumn. It's really about like shopping and putting a look together and like really getting into the autumn of everything. Remember when it was like back to school autumn? I feel like everyone is doing that again. Like, it's time to shop. It's September. We got to shop right now or like July or whenever you're shopping, but like it's all giving autumn. It's all giving everything that was like a thing this season was really going hard on that idea. Yeah. It did feel like brands or designers were trying to like give an argument for why to buy something. Which I think is really important Lawrence, because I feel like that's been lacking recently. By the way, it's not that I want everything to be normal. I love crazy shit. I really love showing me like, damn, that was crazy. I really dig it. And I was so amused by this crazy show. I love it. I love it. Yeah. I love that too. But sometimes you're at the show being like, this is too disconnected from reality. And I'm not feeling it. And I like this show because this feels like it's connected to reality and that they're really trying to do something desirable, just like you said. And I feel like you saw that a lot. This show is brought to you by Boca. Boca knows that when you take care of your mouth, your whole body benefits. That's why they create elevated oral care that fortifies your teeth.

It's interesting. And I really think that he was really saying something about prints and silhouettes, like the bell bottom pants and really bold prints and bold colors and sweaters and stuff. And I, and I, and I'm, and I, and I think he was also really saying something about joy because everyone was having the best time. Like that was the funnest place to be. It really turned my vibe around because I had, I was just not in the best mood that day, let's say. Maybe fashion month had been getting me down and then that just really uplifted me. But I also was like, wait, bell bottoms are cool now. I love that. We're going to see bell bottoms because Durran-Lantic said it. So it's not, and it's also funny. It's like a joke, but I also take it seriously. Yeah. I loved it. I thought that so for the listeners who haven't looked, you should A, look up the show, but B, the opening look was a woman, a model who was a woman wearing essentially a Dickie that is a latex rubber of a man's chest. So it looked like she had a man's chest. It's like if, if someone was wearing like a Donald Trump face, but instead the, she was wearing a man's chest over her chest. And then the end look was a dude wearing like giant breasts, which it was funny. Like people were like, they just laughed. I thought that it, I asked him backstage why he did it. And he's like, well, I think it speaks to herself. And I was like, sure, I should have pushed because I wanted, I should have asked like, why did you put the man first, the woman wearing the man's chest first and the man wearing the woman's chest last? Because that's like a choice. But regardless, it was funny and it like sort of threw people off, but the clothes themselves, like even though they were conceptual and like the skirts were sort of wired to sit off the body and then the, the jeans were bareback or whatever, there was no, there was no butt on the jeans. The ideas, I could see all that stuff being commercialized and made into stuff that people would want to wear. Like I loved the mix of the snakeskin camo and leopard print. Like it looked really good. And that's why I was like, this guy is gonna, this guy's going places because if he can like make these things that are technically unwarrable, look desirable, then he has something big. I am so into him and I love, yes, I see it and I laugh and I believe in it. And I feel that way every season at a show. I've been sold on it since the beginning as something that I'm really entertained by. But this season I was, I was seeing beyond that. I'm literally already excited for to see this guy's next show. I'm just a fan. Can't wait. So you, you were not. I wore a, wait, I'm trying to turn this around. I wore like a similar latex muscle suit in interview magazine because I was modeling Rick Owens, Monclericlose and I was like, my body's not there for Rick Owens' shoot. So I need the muscles. Maybe he was like subconsciously inspired by that shoe. I, well, or just that when I saw it, I was like, I love this man that he's thinking the same ridiculous way. You're on the, you're on the same wavelength. So you landed when you got to, like you landed in Milan. You weren't in London. I, yes, I landed late in Milan. So my first show was Fendi. I missed D squared, unfortunately, which looked so fun. It did look really fun. And I was first at Fendi, Prada. I gotta be honest with you, the, the world and Donald Trump and everything that's been going on, it was like really, my mind was swimming with that. It, with such enormity in Milan, that that was like the real story for me. I was, I was having a hard time disengaging from like geopolitical stuff and reading the New York Times to be really in it with the shows, which was annoying, but it's just a fact. Well, the Zelensky thing happened on Friday afternoon, right? Or Friday afternoon or Friday morning in the U S and Friday afternoon in Milan. Right. And I had, so I would have still been in, yeah, so that's full show zone. It was just a very sad, just was a very sad moment to be an American, I guess. And it just, that just was the whole thing. When I think back on it, that's all I can really see, you know? Yeah. And it was also a season. I mean, this is the thing that what happens at the shows is, no matter what's happening, if there's, I mean, there are many wars going on and you can feel all that stuff more closely in Europe, I'd say. I thought what was interesting about this Zelensky thing was I was sort of like, holy shit, I can't believe this happened. And then I went to dinner that night with a couple Americans and a couple Brits. And it felt like the Brits, you know how usually you come to Europe and everybody's like talking about Ukraine and you're like, oh, this exists, but no one in America talks about this or like what's happening in Palestine and Israel. Like it's so, you can be feel so insular in the U S and inward. Whereas this time, like we went to dinner and we were like, how crazy is this? And they kind of were all just like, yeah, I mean, you're president. That's what happens. It was interesting. Yeah, it was just, it's just really it is the only thing I think of, but we went to the last Donetskhover Saatchi show. I'm so glad I went. I thought it was fabulous. I mean, there's so much to enjoy. And it's gigantic Donetskhover Saatchi goodbye show. Apparently the jacket that she was wearing was made by Johnny Versace for her. So maybe there was like, that was a thing. Oh my God. Just landed in my inbox. Please find the attached press release announcing the appointment of Demna as Gucci's new artistic director starting in early July, 2025. Oh, shit. Shit. Demna. Demna. He just got a new portrait taken this week. I was crazy. It's crazy. Okay, let's see what the press release says. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wow. What do you think? Are you surprised? I love Demna. I literally love Demna. I think he's fucking awesome. And I think he's like the real goat. And I think that I think he can do it. I think it's sick. I really think it's sick. And he's the talk. He's I really do think he's, wow, hold on. That's crazy. Wait, hold on. I have to text somebody. Please hold. I also have to post this on social media and let everyone know that the line sheet coverage of this will be coming later tonight. Oh my God. It's crazy. Wait, it just came out. It literally just landed in my inbox. It's completely great. I'll do the, I'll do this social media stuff on my phone. Whoa. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. That's crazy. It's crazy. He's gonna stay at Balenciaga for, oh my God, I'm getting, I am shocked. I just got a message. I bet he's doing couture because I was. He's gonna do couture. Yeah. Or so. Okay, cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool. Oh my God. He's gonna do couture. He's gonna be at Balenciaga until then. From what I know, they are not going to announce the Balenciaga successor for some time. And honestly, I don't know if that person has been, I don't know if that person has been, has signed the contract yet. Wow. Also, like, what's it gonna look like? What's it gonna look like? I don't know, but I will say I bought a Balenciaga coat. The other day in the showroom, I was like, I'm buying a coat because like my coat, okay, I do not wear fashion. I'm just thinking of, I'm just thinking about Demna as a shopper because I don't really shop that much. They buy like some lower piano stuff or whatever, but like the most boring lower piano stuff. And then I, but I got this coat from the Wall Street show and I'm like, this is the fucking best coat ever. And I like grew my hair out to look good with the coat. I just love this coat. And then I was like, I'm going to show, and I'm going to like, oh, wait, they've got coats. They've got like coats I really want. Oh my God, I really like that coat. And then I went to the showroom and I bought a coat and I'm just bringing it up because even, wait, it's so crazy. I don't even know if this story makes any sense. But like, I was really like, oh, wow, I really desire this thing. I really want it. It's classic, but it's twisted and it's interesting. And I think it's really going to do me right, or maybe even change my life if I buy this thing, right? And I feel like that's the power of this guy. And I think it's really interesting. And I also think it's such a sick time for a refresh. Yeah, I mean, I think I'm saying right now is deranged because I didn't really expect to be talking about this, but I'm, wow. I have been hearing this for the last few days. And I literally wrote on Monday that like, I said it sounded silly for this to happen. Apologies to Demna because I do love him and think he's one of the most brilliant. But I've had some time to process it because as the days went on, the more likely it felt it was going to be. And so I have thought about it pretty intensely. And everyone read my coverage. I have some details no one else will have and like some thinking and logic behind the appointment in Thursday's line sheet that I at this point have not written because we're in the future right now. But I'll write it as soon as we're done talking. But I would say, look, like this is one of the most brilliant. Like this person is a genius, like a full genius. He likes to do things that people don't think he can do. So my assumption was I got the feeling the last few Balenciar collections that he was kind of like, I'm out. Like I really thought he was going to, I think he was just like, I've done. Pardon? Can't see your face. Oh, no. Okay. Hold on. Like that he- We're from the collection. From the collections, from the collection. It wasn't like when Alessandro, his last collection, when he did the interview, I turned to Tim Blanks after we did the press conference. I was like, there's no way that guy is doing another collection at this company. Like, it was really obvious. Wait, what was the last, wait, wait, hold on. What was the last Alessandro Gucci collection again? It was the twins. But like backstage, he was like, I cannot go on. I hate this. I wrote it all down because I like typed it all out because I was like, this man, there is no way this guy can do this anymore. He was like, I am so done. He essentially said that was very interesting. Oh my God. I'm getting, there's just so many things right now. It's so, so funny. But yes, but so the Demna thing. So my feeling is- Oh my God, Demna. I'm sorry. I'm just looking at myself. It's just so crazy. This is really fun to have happen while we're talking. The most ADD podcast ever. It's going to be crazy. Sorry, Mommie. I am not mad. I'm a fan, but like- I'm getting a lot of, I am shocked. I'm getting a lot of, I am shocked. Let's talk. That is shocking. Rolling over the floor laughing. Demna. It's yeah, I'm getting a lot of like, I am shocked. I am shocked. I am shocked. I am shocked. Of course, it's literally shocking. I think it's cool. I think- I just got someone screenshot it in French, one of the articles. Carin Chou's Le Creator. George and Creator Demna for, for relaunch of Gucci, but in, in French. I think, you know, you got to put someone in there. Someone really hardcore needed that job. Well, wait, hold on. Just not, no names, but weren't you being told that it was 100% this other person? Um, I know. I got, there were two things that made me think it was the other person. One was that I talked to some former people who, who were formerly close to the situation, and they insinuated that it was Eddie Slaman and, but like didn't say straight out. And then also, then during the weekend, there were some reports that said that it was Eddie in legit publications. So I was like, Oh, it must be Eddie. But then what happened was like, the last three days, more and more things came up that it was Demna. And he, it became clear that this was actually something that was planned like three months ago. And they've all been holding it in this entire time. Wow. It's wild. It's wild that they were able to, I mean, it's probably a very small group of people that knew originally, I think the last two days, it got more because like the person who told me that Demna was getting his portrait taken was not a person who is like, even in the second ring of the inner circle, you know. So like I'd say the last two days, you probably, there was probably more understanding within the larger group at both companies at both Balenciaga and Gucci that this was happening, but they kept it, I think for a while it was like three people that who know. Wow. It's crazy. Well, I think he can handle like he has a merchant's eye and he is interested in a whole lot of different types of clothes, you know. And I also think it's an interesting time for a brilliant designer such as himself to go from one thing to another. Yeah. One major thing to another. I think he, like, I'd never finish that thought because this is too exciting and I'm getting all these texts, but I think he wanted a new challenge. Think about it this way. You're one of like top five designers working today. And I was thinking about this last fall actually, with Chanel and Dior and all these things. His name is never in the conversation for those kinds of jobs, even though he is, you know, in some ways, the most important designer of this generation or arguably the most important, but he, no one was ever like, I wonder if Demna is interviewing for Chanel. Maybe he did. I have no idea, but it never, his name is never in the mix for things like that. And so I wonder like, and he also seems like a person who wants to prove that he can do something. And this brand, like the way it works for him, I think, is that he's a really good product designer and it is all about product and they need a fashion proposition and he's about fashion. The question is, can he make it enough separate from him and who he is in to like appeal to, I guess the thing is they don't need him to appeal to everyone because they have the Jackie bag to appeal to everyone in the same way Balenciaga has the motorcycle bag to appeal to everybody. But it's interesting, like, can he make a fashion proposition that feels totally different from something he's done in the past? And that will be, that's his challenge. It'll be really interesting to see. It's exciting. It's exciting. I think it's great news. I think it's been like, it's been a rough season. I mean, oh my God, even besides the geopolitical stuff, it's like this, these weird conversations about where everyone's going on like, oh my God, I just want this to end. And I want people to be decided on so we can so people then have this weird transition period. And then we get into something else, you know what I mean? Because like, what are the 20s giving us? You know what I mean? It's very confusing. It's a land of confusion beyond. But hey, every announcement is going towards like fashion in the 2020s really being something. But hey, whatever, whatever fashion is, I've been saying this for a long time because I've been like, y'all are crazy. Like when people are talking about the 2020s, who are they going to think about? What designer are they going to be thinking about? All you bitches listening to the fashion people podcast, you know who it is. I don't even have to tell you people, you know who it is, you know who they're going to be thinking about, you know what they're going to be looking at.

What do you think of Dario Vitali at Versace? I think that he I don't I don't know him. Everyone that knows him loves him. He's cool. I'm really glad it's an Italian. Italians are fiery and kind of crazy in a very specific way. And I bet you that he's got love for that brand and he's going to do it. And also, wait, wait, wait, does that mean that all the other rumors about yeah, it's all like this all makes sense, right? This is like, we're on to another show. We're on to some succession shit big time here. Yeah, we're on to some succession shit. And now the question is, so we've got Dario in at Versace, which it makes a lot of sense because he grew up in the south of Italy in the 90s, he's 42 years old, the same age as me, totally obsessed with Versace makes a lot of sense, especially if it's bought by the product group. But all of my sources on every single side says that he was not planted there by the product group. So don't even start thinking that. But he's really interesting. We have Simone going to Bali, we have Demna going to Gucci, we have Jonathan Anderson going to Dior, which Mel, you cannot say, but I can say we have all the Mattu at Chanel, all these amazing people, Michael Rider at Celine, Louise Trotter at Bottega. Yeah, it's all lined up now. It's all lined up. The one that's left is Balenciaga. Yeah, but this is a season finale. We're in the season finale and that's going to be the final thing. And we have to wait, we're going to have to, I bet they won't announce until after Couture because he starts at Gucci in July and I bet that they will not announce until his final Couture show for Balenciaga. Oh, the new, I got it. Well, what I mean is, yeah, it's like this is like season finale, Game of Thrones, it's all going to change now. And I think that that's great. I think it's wonderful. It's been rough. It was rough last year knowing that this season was going to be this fucked up thing and then it really was weird. It was really fucked up. It was weird. Yeah, so Sarah Burton and Givenchy and Hyder Ackerman at Tom. And who was the other debut this time? There were three of them, right? Wasn't there a debut on Monday or two or a Sunday? Wait, Hyder and Sarah Burton. Those were the only debuts, I guess so. I thought they both did a really good job. Yeah, me too. I'm really looking forward to seeing the stuff from both. I really want to get my hands on this stuff. Yeah, I feel like my thing now, and I always do this, is what will a buyer think and what will a stylist think? Because I am a consumer, so I'm always what will the buyer think and what will the stylist think? Because it's so different from the way I would view things. And it felt like to me that the Sarah Burton stuff, there was a lot of fun stuff to shoot maybe. Yeah, I didn't know that I wanted to shoot a black fishnet justifying my love cat suit, but I do. And there's a lot of fun stuff in there. And the vibe at that show was great. Yeah. I loved the vibe and it felt different and it felt new. And also similar to Calvin Klein, it's shown in the Maison, which is a great place. I've been to shows there before. It's a great place for a very small intimate show where there's people sort of hanging everywhere. I love shows like that. I really love being at a show like that. But this one's really interesting because it was new. And it's something to either really like, which I know a lot of people loved it. And I also saw a lot of hate for it. I think that's healthy. It's good to be polarizing. Agreed. I'm so sick of, we just went through this phase of really bland stuff. And I'd rather it be annoying or like you said, like unsettling than it be bland. It's just no more of these shows where it's just a bunch of clothes that don't have an opinion. Because no one wants to look at that. And it's not good. If you're using a runway show mostly as marketing, which most of these companies are, you got to make it interesting because then people will share it and at least they'll talk about it and interrogate it on X or whatever it's called now. But you have to make it interesting. You cannot just be like, look at my monochromatic bullshit that looks like a trend that was produced or came on the street seven months ago or whatever. Yes. 100%. Wait, where? Oh, I really want to try on the Tom Ford suits. For me, as a stylist, I'm looking forward to playing around with this stuff and for sure. But also, of course, I'm interested in the idea of like a Tom Ford suit, like a dark gray Tom Ford suit. I don't know. That seems cool. I love that you have become a suit man. Well, I'm trying to be a suit man. I don't have an actual suit. I've been wearing a Balenciaga blazer and I also, yeah, but I don't have a suit. I don't know what suit I like. Have you thought of getting one made at husbands? I made, yes. Well, I have multiple ones made at husbands. And for me personally, I prefer my shirts. Like, I feel like I want a suit that's a little more relaxed. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Excuse me. Lies. I do have a suit and it is by Canali and they made it just for me and it's so hot and I don't know why I didn't wear it. This... I feel like I've seen you in this suit and you look great. Now I'm going to be stressed out. I guess I know I must not have brought it to Paris. I don't know why I didn't bring to Paris because sometimes I bring two suitcases because I never know if I'm going to be like feeling crazy and need to wear a suit or like I'm just feeling like wearing sneakers. I don't know. But anyway, I'm really interested. I got my husband's shirts. I'm going to get a suit. I've got my Balenciaga jacket and I've got a bunch of new ties from Charvet and husbands. Perfect. Yeah. I bought a Phoebe Filo suit on this trip. That is hot. It's so good. I've been wearing it. I've done a couple films, been a talking head for a few documentaries here about the luxury industry. I wore a Phoebe Filo suit for it. And also bought the shirt at Charvet and a beautiful scarf at Charvet. Every time I leave Charvet, I say to them, don't sell. Yeah. They're so amazing. They're amazing. Eyes I bought, I can't get over how much I like them. I'm really into the ties. There's one tie that I got that is... Oh, wait, where is it? I don't know where it is. It's my vision was Jerry Seinfeld. And Dara helped me pick the one that's a joke, but you're not going to laugh at me. You're not going to look full. Some of the ties, when I held them up, I'm like, people will laugh on the street if they see me in this one. It's a delicate dance when you're a Jewish middle-aged man that is looking at Jerry Seinfeld for fashion from 1993 for fashion inspiration, but it's possible at Charvet. I agree. I think that even though this was a totally chaotic episode, we completely summed up the state of the industry, which is that everyone is sort of trying to think back to when fashion meant something. And that's why everyone wants to wear a suit and everybody's thinking about corporate culture and everybody. And we're in this weird political time. And also Demna is at Gucci and or is going to Gucci and it's still fun to be in fashion. It is fun to be in fashion. Wait, Lauren, Lauren, if we have two more minutes, what do we forget to talk about? Because I can't get over this Demna thing. What were your favorite shows of the season? I think that someone was asking me and I was like, Prada? I couldn't think of anything. Okay. I really love, I really like the Mew Mew show a lot. I love Durand Land Tank. I was very into Balenciaga so much that I bought a coat. Yes. But I mean, I really like it. I just thought Balenciaga was so funny. Like all those. I thought it was fun. I thought there was a lot of cool. I liked his, I liked the street where I liked the Puma stuff for real. Yes, it was really like. And I liked the ridiculous gowns. The swimsuit gowns? I love when he goes hoey. It's so good. I loved all his bras and lingerie last season. I think it's great. I did too. I'm really into Khloe. Oh yeah, it's beautiful. Yeah. Khloe looks great. And also Khloe, they really know what they're doing with the room. They've got a, they got a, Cheminna's understand, like they understand the room and like the girl and their new girl. And I think it's really fun to see. And it also, I don't know, it's like a new blueprint for like redoing a house that just builds, like it's really easy for her. And I'm sure it's not easy at all, but like it really, cause it's, it's also so big. It's such a big collection, but it's just, it's so convincing to me. On that note, I loved Alaya and thought similarly, it felt like a real fashion show. Like he is so good at, he's such a good commercial designer. I, I've bought a lot of stuff. I know so many women who are buying a ton of it. It just really works commercially. Al, my friend, Ali Pugh, who's a stylist, bought this gorgeous coat. And she was like, should I buy a Tekel bag? And I was like, no, you shouldn't buy a Tekel bag. It's not for you anymore. But yes, she should buy this coat though. I'm sure it costs a gazillion dollars. It was so gorgeous. He really nails it commercially. But I also think the, the fashion show feels like fashion. It doesn't feel like necessarily, oh, I see how he's going to commercialize this stuff. It just feels like, oh, here are a bunch of ideas on a runway and do with them what you want to do, but leave here thinking about something and that technique or whatever. And that was really, really nice. And that was a special, special show too. I mean, I, I still keep going back to Prada, even though when I, when it first came out, I was like, what the fuck? I, I actually haven't mentioned my, my interest in Prada in this podcast today. I, I really liked how Prada to me was really grounded and it was really weird, but I still could believe all these things being totally, being commercialized, being cool ideas for a cool woman to wear as is. And I really liked that. And it suddenly made the last couple years of Prada, the looks look overdone and over styled and a little fussy, but I was, by the way, that's, that's the power of fashion and Prada, because I was like, I dug it then, but then this show made all that look old. And then this was like a new direction. And I'm like, yes, that's, that's, that's right. I love change. Totally. The thing about Prada and Mew Mew and Mew Chup Prada generally, but also Raph, who I am equally fan girl of, is that you, it makes you think, like I, I was looking at old Jill Sander Raph collections because they were getting fed to me on Instagram. I think because I was writing a lot about the changes that's Jill Sander and Simone Balate going there. But those Jill Sander collections he did, I ended up buying a jacket on the real, real. They were insane. Like they were so amazing. And I think what they've done at Prada is every Prada collection I've ever seen while I'm watching it, I'm like, what is going on? And then an hour later, I'm like, that was the best thing I saw all week. And it will be, I mean, there's just no one like her. She is, in the same way, there's no one like Demna and his generation. There's no one like her. She's just in a class of her own. Her Phoebe Philo, Ray Kawakubo, like there, there are only a few of them who have that. And she is just, she's amazing. It's, it really, it always kind of comes back to her in some ways. The way the whole room screamed for her and cheered for her when she came out at Mew Mew, I mean, people think of her as a fucking rock star. And it's so cool. Totally. And obviously it's deserved, but it's just like, it's so fun to see. I don't do a ton of backstage interviews because I find it really stressful. And I'm always like, not all the designers are good at them. So I'm always like, why am I doing this? But I go for her every time. She always has something interesting to say. And it's like, particularly, it's a lot at those shows, because everybody wants a piece of her. But she's worth it. She's just like, I also liked speaking of the end of Tuesday, and then we should go, because I really do need to write about Demna and process this. But I really liked Salon Ron. And I thought that was like a real fashion show and talking about real clothes. A lot of times when I see that collection, I haven't been to many of his shows in person. And on, I'd say on the internet, I often am like, I think this looks cool, but like, it doesn't relate to real life. And this collection, I thought, A, it was like majestic to watch all the color. And I was so, there wasn't a lot of color this season, except at Prada Mimiu. And I loved the way he used color. And it was like a cornucopia, essentially. But then also, it did feel more real. And maybe it's because people are dressing up more, but like the bomber with the ball gown skirt was like, Oh, I know young girls who would, who would copy that look. And it felt like, I don't know, I really enjoyed that show. It was like a really nice way to end Fashion Week, even though a day later, we're dealing with a bunch of shit. I love a heavy scene like that. I mean, it's just so fun to go to a show like that. It's so and it adds it by the way, that adds to me being into the whole thing. Like I'm, I'm always into the thing of Saint Laurent. But man, they really do, they also really know how to work a room. I would say like, wait, Chloe, Alaya, Saint Laurent, just thinking about it, those guys all, they work a room in a really different way. Like, like the, and it all, they're just like, it's creating this whole ambiance. Everyone's doing it. Don't get me wrong. Every, oh, me, me, it'll be on also. And this time it was so funny with all these influencers that were just like, there I stayed for like an hour after the show, just taking videos of all these influencer kids that were just like posing everywhere. And it's just everything. I don't know. Maybe this is sort of an interesting season. I'm glad we were there, Lauren. I'm glad we were there too, Mel. And I'm glad we got to do this together. I hope you have an amazing vacation. Thank you. I'm glocking, I'm logging out on life now when I don't guys, don't text Mel. Don't text me guys. By Lauren have fun writing about this. Wow, Demna, congrats. Congrats Demya. Dem, congrats Demna. Much love, Mel. Thank you for doing this. Of course, to my pleasure. Bye. Fashion People is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck. This show was produced and edited by Molly Nugent. Special thanks to our executive producers, Puck co-founder John Kelly, executive editor Ben Landy and director of editorial operations, Gaby Grossman. An additional thanks to the team at Odyssey, J.D. Crowley, Jenna Weisberman and Bob Tabador. Each spring, 23 Pulitzer prizes are awarded for distinguished journalism, books, drama and music. There was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize-winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out. It was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th. Follow and listen on Apple podcasts, the Odyssey app, Spotify or wherever you get your podcast.",
