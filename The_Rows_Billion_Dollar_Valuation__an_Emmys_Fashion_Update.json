And today with me on the show is fashion journalist Hilary Kerr. We're talking Emmys Red Carpet, the best of London Fashion Week. There rose new money and a whole lot more. Let's get started. Hi, everyone. Hope you are having a great week. I am on my way to Milan for Milan Fashion Week and then to Paris for Paris Fashion Week and then back to California for a week to see my kid and my husband who's very nice and watches my kid all the time. And then I'm back to New York for the launch of my book that I wrote with Chantal Fernandez. It's called Selling Sexy, Victoria's Secret and the Unraveling Evan American Icon. It comes out October 8th. Please buy it. This week in line sheet, there is a lot going on. I have more details on the rose deal with Moose Partners, Tethys Investments, Imaginary, the venture capital firm and Lauren Sando Domingo's new fund. So there's a lot going on. I also have a little more deal speculation in there around Todd Snyder, which seems like it was a false alarm, but still interesting that that was the rumor and then also Viore is raising money. So check it out to hear more details of what's happening there. I also have news on who is styling the Victoria's Secret fashion show. I think anyone who's interested in magazines and Parisian fashion will be surprised and excited by who they brought on. And then later this week, I have a bunch of stuff. I have a scoop on a new brand launch. There's going to be an EIC announcement, Paris Fashion Week scheduling news. There's just a lot going on. It is fashion month. I was so happy to have Hillary on today. We have known each other forever. I think I met her at Oscar de la Renta show in 2010 or something, but I've been following her work long before that. She's the co-founder of Who What Where, which was one of the, everybody talks about like newsletters, like they're this new thing. First of all, Bob Letzets has been doing his newsletter for, I don't know, 30 years or something, but email newsletters are not new. And Who What Where was originally an email newsletter about like get the celebrity look. And I was obsessed with it. Hillary and Catherine Power, who co-founded it, it was just, it was unlike anything I'd ever seen. And they built it into this media empire that ended up getting acquired by Future Publishing Hillary's now the SVP of like all their fashion and lifestyle titles at Future. And she also writes a very instructive newsletter called Hi There with Hillary Kerr, which I find extremely helpful. Not only do I buy a lot of the stuff that she suggests, but also for gifts. And I don't know, it's just good to see what's on the market. Hillary is very high low. She buys stuff from old naming. She also buys stuff from Gucci. And so she's not, she's not a snob, but she has like a very particular taste and also really does the work from the recommendation and perspective. So she'll, once you try it on like 25 pairs of jeans to see what fit her well, that type of thing. And I just really respect it. And she's also an expert on the business of red carpet. And so it was great to have her on, on this Emmys, Emmys wrap up episode. So let's go. Hillary Kerr, welcome to fashion people. Thank you, Lauren. I am so excited to be here. As you know, I am obsessed with your podcast and with the line sheets. So this is really a dream for me. You are my biggest fan and I am forever grateful. I mean, self-appointed vice president, and we'll take president of your fan club. I'm sure someone else has official rights to president, but I just, I love everything that you do. And so this is really exciting on a number of levels. You're the best. The feeling is mutual. Before we get started, how was your weekend? Did you buy anything fun? Did I buy anything fun? Well, you know, a little, there might be a pair of shoes in the mail coming towards me. That is always, always a possibility, but nothing super outrageous. Nothing beyond amazing. And I feel like I did a lot of my shopping when I was in New York last week because of the Net-A-Porter same day delivery aspect makes it very, it's very dangerous, very easy to shop, especially because I shop from the airplane so that it's in my hotel room by the time I land. That's so luxurious. I love that. I actually went, I only did one, I guess this was over a week ago, now it's two weeks ago, but I did one run into a store, Lug Arsane, to pick up something that I had ordered online because I was just like, their warehouse is there and I figured, oh, it'll be easier. I was staying nearby and I thought, oh, I'll just buy, I'll buy the sweatshirt, I'll go pick it up in the store. And then I went to the store and I bought something else. That was not, not the same budget. That is often how these things happen. I get it. But I also feel like I shop a fair amount, but I don't actually purchase that much. So when I do find something that I actually really like, I'm fine to commit. I agree. I agree. We're both pretty responsible, I'd say, in the grand scheme of things. So tell me, did you go out for the Emmys at all or were you in? No. Do you ever go out for the Emmys? I was invited to a party and I was so excited. And then I promptly fell asleep at 8.15 because I'm still on New York time and flying to Milan tomorrow, technically today when this publishes. I love that. Parties are wonderful and I love being invited. But the reality is, is that I'm still, even in my current role, the very editorially minded person that I am who is in my, the Slack rooms with my teams, I'm still, I'm texting Stylist and publicist. I'm confirming things. I am still digging and trying to figure out all of the details for Who What Where and Marie Claire's coverage for award shows. I love that piece of it. It's, you know, it's, it's strange that I still am that deep in it, but I really like to focus on that piece of it. Also, you know, the parties can be really fun and amazing, but I just got back from traveling from New York and I am not really in the mood for that at this exact second. I understand. I have been in those war rooms with, with red carpet, red carpet war rooms before and it is, it is super fun, but that is, I mean, you're once a journalist, always a journalist and you all do the best job at identifying all those dresses and jewelry and shoes and all of that. Who worked with whom and which makeup artist. I was even thinking about that today. I did a tiny little, my favorite pics and I loved Maya Erskine who, who in customer darte. Yes. And which was very difficult to find that information. And then also she, her makeup always looks truly incredible and I realized she doesn't actually work. She works with Rebecca Grice as her stylist, but with makeup, she works with a lot of different makeup artists. And what I realized, it's just her coloring and her skin is incredible. Yeah. Being beautiful helps. Yeah. Like her, she wears red lipstick in a way that I just don't think many people can pull off. And I am always like, Oh, who does her makeup? Who does her makeup? And every time it's someone different. So I just realized it's just her. Also she just had a baby and is like glowing and looks amazing. So you know, I think that, well, two things. One, I'm still really competitive about getting those reporting details right and getting them fast and just being as accurate as possible. And I still push our teams to do that because it's something that I really care about. And the reason I care about it is because there's so much strategy involved and you figure thinking like, you can tell who is on the rise. You can tell who's making a pivot. You can tell so much about what's going on with someone's career based on the team that they have around them and who they're working with for hair and makeup, who they're working with, who their stylist is, like who's loaning address to them, who's making something custom for them. I find all of that, again, strategy so interesting. So I feel like the devil is in the details and it really gives you an interesting perspective on everyone's fortunes and everyone's intentions and also is a really amazing opportunity to credit the talent behind these amazing looks to credit the stylist and the hairstylist and the makeup artist and make sure that you have those details right on the bag and the jewels. And I love all of the details. I want to know that Jennifer Aniston is wearing vintage archival Tiffany. I find that detail interesting. So that part of it is always really fun. Yeah, it's a giant, giant economy in and of itself and I do think you all are tracking it better than anyone else. So tell me, what did you love last night? What would be your best dressed picks? So I have to say this was not my favorite red carpet of all time. I feel as though one, we just had the Emmys like eight months ago. So I feel like we already, we just did this to some degree. Two, I also felt like it was a pretty safe red carpet. I was surprised that we didn't see more fashion on it. I think there's probably due to the fact that as you and I have discussed, IRL that lots of brands and fashion houses are sort of in a nebulous position right now. They have, they might not have a creative director or they have someone who has been announced but hasn't like fully stepped into their vision yet. So there were fewer like big design talents at hand. I think like the pool was just smaller for everyone to choose from. So maybe that's why people went a little bit safer and a little bit more old Hollywood to some extent. Of course, the obvious fashion answers here are always Greta and Io who are both dressed by God, why am I blanking? Danielle. Danielle, lovely Danielle Goldberg. Danielle Goldberg who is such an incredible talent and always has a way of making them look uniquely themselves and also unlike what anyone else is wearing. So I love the fact that Io had that beautiful strapless, I believe custom Bottega dress, very classic silhouette, very old Hollywood silhouette, but then the sequins and the colors of the sequins gave it this, I think someone called it Koi and I think that was actually quite accurate. Like it made it so modern and interesting that I forgot that it was a very simple kind of retro silhouette because it felt so fresh and modern. And then on the other side Greta in Loewe and by the way, can we discuss, did you see her jewelry? It's so funny. That's exactly what I called out the sapphire earrings in particular. Tanzanite. Oh, they were tanzanite. Thank you. You're welcome. Just saved me a fact correction in my newsletter today. They were remarkable. The earrings, the ring too. And it was Tiffany as well, right? Yes. All of it was Tiffany. She had like a 10 karat diamond ring and then also I think it was like almost 19 karats between the earrings. Those beautiful tanzanites that were surrounded by diamonds. We haven't seen like a gumdrop marble statement earring like that in a minute. And I was actually pleasantly surprised by all of sort of the more statement-y earrings that we saw in general. That was to me some of the most interesting aspects of the red carpet, but I loved it. I just felt like she looked like this ethereal angel swan and she looked very comfortable and then she also had these like knockout jewels on, which I mean to be effortless in the gown and then such a bold statement in the jewels. I think there's something very chic about that. I agree. I thought she looked really elegant and the orange sequence on Io's Bottega were, it was just dynamite. It looked so great. And it's the thing of like every single time I look and see what looks best, it's always at least one of Danielle's clients. And the thing is you don't want to kind of go to that back, but she's doing exactly what you said, which is she's making them look like human beings. It's not the clothes aren't wearing them and it doesn't just feel like I want to look pretty. And it's not cut and paste mermaid silhouette. And it's not like I'm going to be fashioned with a capital F that's in a look at me sort of way. And I think that the dress seemed elegant and cool and themselves. Totally. And I also thought another person I thought looked really good that, you know, I think it's like pretty mixed is Divine Joy Randolph. She was in Sophie Couture and it, I just thought her dress, it was like a lemon yellow. It's like a limoncello. Because there's almost like a neon aspect to it. Not quite neon, but like more electric than I was expecting. And also someone who looked like she felt great and comfortable in what she was wearing. Totally. And she wears cool stuff. She wore Weetan for, I forget which maybe for the Oscars, though the last time around and she looked good and she has a cool sense of style. But I just thought like, Oh, that, that is really beautiful. I also liked who else did I put on it? Oh, I, you know what I loved, which I think was probably better in person is Elizabeth DeBicke and Dior. The black velvet. Yes. So elegant. Yeah. And she's really tall too. So I can just imagine that she just looked like, I mean, it's very regal, right? Yeah. Yeah. It was, and that, it surprised me. It was very, she didn't, I'm sure she had earrings on, but it was like not no jewelry on the neckline. I think it's the thing with the stuff is it is so hard sometimes in person versus on camera, what's how something reads. And I think there's a lot of stuff that doesn't look great on camera that probably in person look dynamite. And I just have a feeling that it looked good, but I bet it was even more striking in person to see her. More impactful. Yes. Totally. I also really liked Anna Sawai who was wearing custom Vera Wang. And Cartier, she's like one of the new ambassadors, I believe. And Carla Welch styled her. And I just thought, I mean, it was much more classic, traditional, what you would expect from a major red carpet, but still like with the drop ways and the fit and the color of it, it's still like, it was so great. It was like the best possible version of a bit of a touch of that old Hollywood, in my opinion. I thought she looked fabulous as well. And I don't watch that show Shogun, but I need to watch it. Do you watch it? Well, now I feel like it's inevitable. We all have to after so many wins. Yeah. Maybe I'll watch it over the Christmas holidays. I don't know when I would have tied before that. I mean, let's be honest, I was watching the perfect couple as of recently. So that just tells you where my head's at. You gotta love Leigh F. Schreiber and Nicole Kidman. I mean, it's, you have to try it. You have to try it. This show is brought to you by Boca. Boca knows that when you take care of your mouth, your whole body benefits.

I just like, I like regular tuxes that are kind of fun and I thought it was a good regular tux that was like a little more interesting, like Tom Brown penny loafers. I thought he looked really cute. He looked like he was wearing the tux, not the tux wearing him. Which I think I love that men are taking more, it feels like fashion or sartorial risks while still staying appropriate. But sometimes when you see that, you also get a little bit of a sense of they're not fully comfortable in the peacocking or they're not certain about something that was not the case with Krist. He very much clearly felt at ease and I think that's very elegant and cool. I agree and I think 100%, so many people had on sort of 70s, boot cut colored things and they just looked, they didn't look good. But who I did think looked really good was Tyka Waititi in Brunello. That looked fabulous and I'm very anti light pants and a dark top, but in that case, I think it was like whitish off white trousers and then a maybe chocolate brown blazer. And I thought he looked really great. I thought Stephen Colbert who was wearing all black Armani looked good. And then also I thought Dan Levy for the, for the sort of more flamboyant thing with that sort of wave coming out of his silk blouse. I thought he looked, he was in Loewe, he looked fabulous as well. I thought he looked fabulous the whole way through. I loved all of the looks. I think it was great and I agree with you that that was much more of a fashion moment than we're used to seeing in this situation. But again, expected from him, he seems comfortable in it and that at the end of the day, if the fits right and the person feels comfortable, that to me ultimately is the most important thing. Yes, I agree. I overall think you're right that it just wasn't my favorite night. Well, there was a lot of repetition too, which was interesting where it was like, you know, similar look in different fonts. Like, oh, we've got a bunch of, of this like same shade of pink that we're seeing across the board or a really similar silhouette. I mean, I was making notes as the show was going on. The number of people who were doing essentially like archival 1950s, maybe a little bit 60s was tremendous. And it was in again, in slightly different versions, almost everyone was doing that. And I really wasn't expecting it. I thought that we would see things that were more modern or things that were less traditional. I felt like we'd been moving in that direction. There's no scaparelli on the red carpet for this show, probably because it's been, you know, we've had Venice and we've had the Toronto Film Festival. But you know, there were some of those like more daring moments. I didn't, I didn't feel like we really had. Agreed. So, so moving on to the other side of the world and a different side of fashion. I know you're a big London fashion week person. I am. I feel like you used to go every single season. Yes, I really love it. I think that it's completely underrated in a variety of ways. I think that there are so many cool and interesting designers in the UK that don't necessarily get their flowers as much as, you know, the designers who show in Paris and to Milan to some extent. It's always a little bit rebellious and a little bit punk and always like feels like it's doing its own thing to some degree. And it's also the 40th anniversary of London Fashion Week. Did you realize that? No, that's crazy, though. I know. Kind of cool. So, yes, I always get excited about it. I wear a lot of British designers and always have because I just feel like it feels a little bit less expected or that there's a little bit of a subversive twist, even if it's a pretty femme or traditional silhouette. I don't know. I just love it. I think that you're right. So who did you like so far this season? Well, I always love Amelia Wickstead. It's very feminine, but I think that it's so beautifully made. It's not going to be like the number one show for some crazy trend at all. But if it's really wearable, it's really well made. It's really elegant. Also, Jillian Anderson just wore one of her dresses to the Emmys. And I think she looked fabulous. It was, like, again, pretty traditional silhouette, but then in the sort of metallic fabric that made it feel, again, a little bit fresher and more interesting. I was also excited to see that Roxanda showed again because that brand has been going through some things, I think, financially. But I think that she has an incredible eye for color. Like, it's very painterly the way that she pairs colors together. So I always have an eye out for that. Simone Rochat is one of my favorites always as well. I own more Simone Rochat than maybe any other designer or brand, with the exception of J.Crew. But I just think that she's sort of the melancholy, slightly goth dream designer in so many ways. It's I think she's also a little bit challenging for a lot of more mainstream consumers in part because there's often like a really intense volume moment. And I think that she evolved it in a way that still feels true to the brand, but perhaps just a tiny bit more accessible to people for this season, which was great. And then I've also been sitting there watching very, very closely, both SS Daily, which is I think a really interesting brand. Harry Styles is invested in it and they showed their first women's collection, which was based on a British artist called Gluck, who was sort of a pen name for the artist and painter Hannah Gluckstein, who was really, I think, rose to prominence in like the 20s. So she would do a little bit more masculine dressing. And so this collection feels kind of genderless, but still youthful and interesting and cool. So I've been keeping an eye there. And then also I was really excited to see what Burberry was up to, because that's another one of those heritage brands that I'm always rooting for. And I want them to continue to do well. And I haven't fully digested it because it only happened a couple of hours ago and I've been in meetings, but from what I saw, it looked good. Have you seen it? You know, I'm looking it up right now. The flood of gossip around Burberry that is just too preliminary gossip for me to partake in is wild, that I've gotten just from the last couple of hours. I've been so crazy, but let me look at it really quickly. I thought the last collection looked good on the runway as well. I would say in person. It was tougher. It doesn't. Yeah, I mean, this looks good. Like I think that it works on the runway for sure. And it feels this this feels very like. Reliving or trying to. Pay homage to the Christopher Bailey years that were so special and and made the brand and profitable today. Yes. I mean, to me, it feels very commercial in a great way, but it still has like a coolness factor to it. I love there are lots of like like floor length skirts that then have like this crazy slit and I saw some interesting things going on with sequins, which feels like sequins for spring seem to be sort of popping up in interesting places. I don't know. Again, I haven't fully digested the whole thing, but I liked my initial first impressions of it. Yeah, I really like this. I think the big thing that it's doing right is taking the idea of the trench and using it in in a lot of different ways, like for actual coats, but also just the way the dresses, the dresses are draped and things like that. And the big thing that when, when Burberry just got a new CEO, when Joshua Joshua Schumann signed on and his statement essentially was saying, like, we are an outerwear brand. We need to be an outerwear brand first. And so maybe the directive was to really focus on outerwear for, and I mean, it's always about the outerwear, but it, this does feel like more of a statement and of you're right, a commercial one. Like it feels a lot like a, probably a pre-collection vibe, but I don't think that's necessarily bad because in the last few years with Daniel Lee, he, he had such a distinct point of view at Bottega and he really changed the way everybody thought about that brand very, very, very quickly, like within a season. And so the interesting thing about his time at Burberry has been that what is Burberry is really hard to define. And this feels like almost like a palette cleanser to a point of let's just establish the kind of look we're doing. There is a look to this, whereas in the past few seasons, it's been a little more confusing. And I felt like just looking at it through my shopping lens, like some of those dresses that have that trench element up top, but then come in fitted and flare out some of those amazing skirts, like it does, it feels like it's connected to those heritage mainstay codes while still being like beautiful and elegant and something that we all want to wear. So again, early moments, but I immediately was like, yep, yep, yep, yep. I could see right off the top of my head, like I can imagine this person wearing it. I can see this being a thing. It feels, it made me want to reach for my wallet, which isn't indicative of something. Maybe my shopping habit, but. No, that's not that. It couldn't be. Yeah. I think it's a wait and see with them. I'm sure the response, let's see what their response is from buyers and consumers and all of that. It's an interesting brand. And I think it's going to be one that we're all going to be watching much more closely over the next year or so. And especially when they invite you on their press trip to COA system summer, Hilary. The dream, the dream of all dreams, of course. I mean, I would die a thousand deaths of joy if that actually happens. I also, on a side note, I feel like we can't talk about London Fashion Week and not talk about JW Anderson. That was going to be the one I was going to bring up, but I thought it was great. It's so a friend of mine who works in the industry, but is also just like, follows everything so closely, sends me 15 links a day with analysis on everything. Wow. Mentioned, I think Harris Reed also, but really talking about JW and this idea. We actually saw us a bit in New York too with like bubble skirts. There is this kind of nod to La Croix and to, it's so hard. Do you really, I really want to say La Croix because La Croix, all my European listeners, there's a soda like a sparkling water drink in America from Wisconsin called La Croix. But they don't say La Croix. La Croix and Christian Lacroix in my head now because La Croix is overtaken my life. But anyway, back to JW, this friend of mine mentioned like Angaro Lacroix from the 80s, like the puff skirts, the colors. There is something happening right now. Burberry was like a lot of really pale colors, but there's like a lot of lavender and purples happening. But what my friend said about JW in particular was it took some of those ideas from that sort of 80s era, but made it really sporty and sort of like kicked the opulence out of it. And so it's fun to see the bubble skirt return. Yeah. But like in this more, in a less precious ways perfectly, but I thought it would fabbin. I'm always amazed by how he manages to have two brands where he's able to direct people to do interesting things. I know. It's crazy. Because it's just like, and his teams change all the time. Like these people, they're small. And the thing that people have to remember with these creative directors, yes, they have second in commands that are incredible. But the thing is when it comes down to it, it is the person in charge. It's their decision. It's their fault if it doesn't go well. And so it is like really coming from the top. There are some examples of people where they have a second in command who's been with them forever and that person has an outsized kind of influence. But I think generally with someone like Jonathan, that's really about his ability to have a big picture idea and tell people how to execute it, which is so hard to do. It's really crazy. He's, it's amazing. And great that he's still in London fashion week. Because that is also the thing. It's a harder sell to go there these days. In the same way that for New York is a harder sell for a lot of Europeans. So I get it. I also like the fact too that he keeps challenging himself in interesting ways or choosing to challenge himself. Like he only used four materials in this collection. It's a cashmere, silk, leather and sequence. Like that's kind of wild too. To keep it that narrow and that focused. It's also interesting because you bring up the sportiness and like the 80s sport to it and like taking some of that preciousness out. It's fascinating to me because to me it's sport as in relation or in conversation to tennis mostly. And I keep thinking about all of the brands that seem to be playing in this space, especially some of the up and coming brands in the States where it feels like, and I don't know if somehow this is also like related to pickleball or paddleball or like any of those other sporty things and like, okay, we've moved past the Olympics. And so what's the new iteration of sport? But it does feel to me that there's, it's something related also specifically to tennis sport. Am I, are you catching that too? I mean, I know you are on the, the, for sure New York designers and American brands that are doing it. But. Yes. And last week someone wrote me and said that they're very into padel, I think is how you pronounce it, which is sort of in the same world of pickleball and, but it's more international. It's Euro pickleball. Yeah, sort of. Yeah. I think it's big in India also. Amazing. I mean, don't quote me on that people, but I'm pretty sure that that's how when I worked a business of fashion, we first wrote about it in the context of it being popular in India, but it became big globally during the pandemic. But yeah, I think that what it speaks to is this idea of as you are someone who doesn't really wear jeans very often, you like to wear dresses, but day to day, I mean, you also wear leggings and we all sort of, I'm in running shorts right now. Like it's, you are wearing a dress, but I will be wearing something other than running shorts at some point today potentially. Actually, I might not. I don't, I'm not going to see, I'm going to get my hair dyed. Who cares? But the point being that like day to day, we dress pretty casually and even on days when I go into the office, I am a jeans person. I wear a lot of jeans, but you know, 10 years ago, I didn't wear jeans to the office. So it's no, I mean, I think that's a New York versus LA. Because when I'm in New York, I don't wear jeans as much. Interesting. Yeah. I used to wear a lot more dresses and would wear jeans on the weekend, but now I wear jeans during the week and then wear shorts or something. I still wear jeans on the weekend if we have like, we're seeing people, but I've become less dress focused living here, especially. But I think the, the point is that, yes, there's a lot of opportunity in that tennis market generally, because it's, it's almost like the next running. Everybody does it. So why not have more clothes around it, but be, uh, I think that people just want, I went to that Spence launch in New York for that new brand, which is so great. And I ordered a polo and two track shorts because I'm not going to, I don't really play tennis. I played in high school, but like, I'm not, I don't really play day to day, but I need stuff like I need cute track shorts to wear on the weekends and things because people, it's always better to be overdressed, but just generally, I think our society has casualized in the last 30 years in particular. And so there's going to be just like more and more micro granular brands and things like that. And so yeah, it totally makes sense that it laddered back to the runway because he's probably one of the few designers that still looks to the street for inspiration. Also, he did challengers. Yes. Let us not forget. So tennis has been on his brain for a minute. Yeah. The other thing that I keep going back to is like, I feel like we've seen some more short stuff in general or shorter hemlines, which to me also, I'm wondering, okay, it seems like legs are having a moment. Part of that short, it's like the tennis sportiness of it all, but it's also we've been wearing, it's been so baggy, jean and leg covering and trouser heavy for a minute. And we all know that everything just runs in a cycle. Does this tie back to when Sabato at Gucci showed a bunch of minis and everyone was like, whatever about it, but now that takes a minute for the eye to adjust. Now all of a sudden, everyone else is showing shorter. And now all of a sudden, shorter is looking fresher and more interesting, whereas it felt maybe a little early with that Gucci collection, his first Gucci collection. And in the combination of tennis and sport and hemlines, and it's just everything is reactionary and it's all just the opposite swing of whatever we've seen before. So maybe this is just we're going short because it's been so leg concealing for the last handful of seasons. 100%. You're exactly right, Hillary. Not to be a conspiracy theory. I feel like carry in homeland with my my map of all these things connecting, but it's like there's always that first thing that then tips everyone over. And it feels like maybe we were just waiting for a shorter moment. Totally. And I think if you look at the Mew Mew, there's literally like two threads. There's the Gucci thread and the Mew Mew thread of the short stuff. And the Mew Mew thing is very school girl and it's pleated and it's, but the Gucci thing was very mocked. And low rise. Yeah, and low rise. Yeah. And so it's interesting that the little tennis skirt that Spence did, that Tracy Giorgio who's working with them and does a lot of brand partnership stuff for a lot of different people, she had it on. And I was thinking exactly that it does ladder back. It's interesting to see the Gucci rollout has been so fraught, but there is something did come out of it. Yeah, there really is. And it's, it's unfortunate that they, it hasn't yet translated and it may not translate to sales. We'll see, but it's still very early. Unfortunately, it's crazy that a lot of Sabato's clothes still aren't, they've only been in stores for a couple of months, which is, he's been there for over a year. And I mean, it's just public markets, billion plus dollar companies are wild. But yeah, the influence is real. I think you're exactly right.

It was crazy. I'm getting good guys. You're boring. I'm getting good at this. So I wanted to talk to you about the rumor of the week that became true. Oh, yes. And a big picture of what you think. So, oh, let's see. About two weeks ago, I got some messages being like, I heard the row finally sold a stake, 40%. It turns out it was a little less than 40. I just confirmed that a couple of hours ago. But 40%. They had been raising, they wanted their previous investor, this very famous investor guy, Byron Trott. He had expressed interest in exiting the business like over a year and a half ago. I wrote a story about that. And they worked on deals this summer and they helped, his team really helped make that happen. And so they have a new group of investors, including Moose Capital, which is the Worthheimer family, Tethys Capital, which is the Benton Court Myers, L'Oreal Money family. And then also Imaginary Ventures, the VC firm backed by Natalie Masenay and Nick Brown. And then also Saint Dominique, just kidding, Saint Dominique Capital, which is the newly formed fund from Lauren Santor Domingo, who is the co-founder of Mara Barandi. And she also consults at Tiffany and all these things. So basically went from this very traditional financial investor who also had previously been invested in Tory Burch II for two family offices, one VC firm and one sort of private investor smaller fund. And the amazing thing is, these are all people who were deeply connected and understand the fashion industry. The valuation was a little north of a billion dollars. This company was started over 15 years ago by two people who had, were famous for being on full house when they were two years old or whatever. And they defied everything to make the only, truly the only independent luxury brand to emerge over the last 20 years that has potential to compete against 100, 200, 300 year old companies, not only for mind share and for influence over what other, what people dress like day to day, but also from market share and wallet share. They, they really are remarkable what Mary Kay and Ashley Olson have built over the past 15 years. And so I'm not surprised by this valuation at all. I'm not surprised by the fact that all of these very illustrious investors wanted to be connected to it. It all makes a lot of sense. But I'm curious, you have covered the row since the beginning. You've also covered the Olson since before the row through who, who, what, where, and your work at L and you really understand celebrity culture and designer culture and how those two things connect better than anyone. What do you think about their trajectory? I think you're absolutely right that they've built something with true gravitas and true power and not just power, but long term power, which is the rarest thing of all. And I think that they've done it in the right way in the way that not every brand or designer has the ability to do, which is slowly and methodically and carefully and over time. I think that's one of the things that pains me about what's going on in the luxury fashion world as a whole is like how quickly people are cycled in and out. They're not given time to really grow into their roles because there's so much money at stake, although I think having, you know, firing someone and then sitting out one, two seasons while you're getting the next person in isn't a great necessarily role either or strategy either. But like they've had the gift of time and they've also had the gift of independence in that they could build the way they wanted to build. They didn't have to run out and do accessories at this point because someone was pushing them. They didn't have to do anything other than what they thought was really right for building the brand. They didn't have to have a fashion show the way that everyone does. They could really do their own thing. And I hate to say it, but I do think no shade to all of the strategists out there. I think there's something to having that really personal customer centric strategy that focuses on brand long-term and not immediate turnaround and profit that is critical to building something long-term. And I think it's so amazing and incredible what they've done, but I also think it's very interesting that they've chosen very strategic partners in this round who deeply understand that brand. They did not go to people who were going to give them a bunch of money to like juice something and turn it around and do whatever. They chose to find partners who would really help them obviously scale, but slowly, methodically, strategically, over time to build that next big, to your point, American luxury brand, which is great. It may be the first true American luxury brand. If you think of luxury as being leather goods and shoes, the fact that they have managed to break into this incredibly challenging leather goods market without any heritage is remarkable. And to be a leader in it, they're the top handbag for a lot of multi-brand retailers. I'm going to do a deep dive on them one day. I need to figure it out because we could talk about this for the next four hours, but I think one thing that I've noticed and I've been covering them for a long time, they are very, very, very, very protective of themselves, of their personal lives, of course, because obviously they've been famous since they were very young and they, I mean, they must just be wary of every single person that shakes their hand, but also in the press that they've done around the brand. And they did a good amount of press at the beginning and then it reduced, reduced, reduced, reduced, reduced. And essentially, they do nothing now. They did a piece with the FT about, I don't know, a year ago that was decent. They've gone Beyonce. Yeah. And Joe Allison, who did it interviewed me for it. But, and it was interesting because I was like, wow, they really, they just don't want to share anything. And well, they don't have from my perspective, but they don't have to. And the interesting thing is like, I remember I did an interview with them about Elizabeth and James. I was actually talking about it with someone today, probably like eight or nine years ago. And it was really good because I had never sat down with them. And it was just about Elizabeth and James and what they were doing there. But then we started talking about other parts of the business. And they said, you know, we just really want to grow it in the right way. And what I realized sitting with them, everyone says that everyone says, I want to grow slowly. I want us to grow carefully. What I realized is these two people are more self-possessed than probably anyone else in this business. And they will do it the way they want to do it. And they will be careful. And they, of course, they had money to be able to do that. And to, that's the thing, everyone says it. But at the end of the day, if you don't have extremely deep pockets that allow for that independence and to be able to, you know, test and prove your point of view, you will always be under pressure in a different way. And that is the luxury that they have had that has been instrumental to this success, I think. Totally. And I think that is true. And it is also true that a lot of other people also have that luxury and squander it. And so the other, the other thing is it's interesting with them. We're just talking about second and command designers. They've had a lot of amazing designers come out of that. Nadezh, who is at Hermes is incredible. But the thing is, it is them. And the, and every time I email their publicist and say, me again, I have more info, I love reporting on them. It's an incredible story. And the fact that they don't talk to people, is it annoying for me? Yes. But you know what, I really respect it. And I think just generally the way that they've managed all of this, they've had hard times during the pandemic. There were reports that, I mean, they had to lay off a lot of people. There were reports that they might close menswear that they might only do accessories. It's not been easy, but what they have remained steadfast. And so they used all the privilege that they had, they used the disadvantages of that privilege, which is that, you know, it was harder to be taken seriously, all of that stuff. And they managed to continually, again and again and again, prove people wrong, that they weren't going to mess it up, that they weren't going to sell to the wrong person, that they weren't going to change their design philosophy, because suddenly everything's super logo driven. And so it's honestly been a privilege to cover it and tell their story, even when they didn't want me to. Well, don't you think, though, that part of it is because I've always gotten the sense that they're making clothes for themselves. Like it is really deeply personal about what they want to wear. And yes, obviously, they're the client, they know the client very well after all of this time. But you can really hold on to what something is when you're making it for yourself, to some extent, right? I also think it's been interesting to watch the strategy as well, because they have also focused as time has gone on. Because remember, there was style mint, there was Elizabeth and James, wasn't there a line for Kohl's at one point in time? They've done lots of things. Walmart, yep. Walmart, they did a Walmart line and Kohl's. And then it keeps, they kept narrowing and narrowing. And they did support all of those other things. I mean, I did a live stream for style mint with Mary Kay Olson for Black Friday a decade ago. They were out supporting the things that they were involved with. But as time has gone on and the focus has really narrowed on this key business, it's really interesting to watch. And to that point, again, like they don't have to do these things. They don't have to do the press. They don't have to allow cell phones into shows if they don't want. They don't have to do the same type of advertising or whatever it may be, because it speaks for itself because the sales are already there. We'll see how, we'll see that can't, I doubt that it can stay that way forever, but who knows. Exactly. I mean, that's the great thing about being a private company. You don't have to share that information. And also most private companies, when they're fundraising, they do share it because they want, they're having trouble fundraising. So they share all their information so that you get more interest from unexpected places. The role was in an amazing position where I'm sure anyone would invest in it. Just because of the association. And it was, these people wrote very big checks. This is not, this is no laughing matter. And so it'll be interesting to see what they spend that money on though, right? Because normally when you take on money, it's like you have this very clear plan of what the return on investment is that people are going to, investors don't invest for 40 years, right? That they in theory want return on it. So it'll be interesting to see, or maybe in this case, because of their very strategic nature of who they chose to work with, maybe there is an appetite for a long runway. But when you take outside money to this degree, usually it means that then something is in the works, which will be interesting to see. Yeah. I think the big focus is going to be Asia expansion and more stores in particular in Asia, because they only have four stores. So think about how many stores Loewe, which is one of the smaller LVMH brands has. So there is an opportunity to, to get bigger and that the expenses for opening a store, they're going to have a cafe in the Paris store. The, the catbacks on a store is just so crazy. So I think that's what it is. I think the one thing, and I wrote this in my piece on Monday, that I, that is the question is, can they get to a billion dollars and sales a hundred percent? They're at like between 250 and 300 right now, they can get to a hundred percent. That's no problem. Can they get to two billion or five billion? And what one like very savvy person in this world said was, can they? We don't, we don't know. There isn't really an example of a luxury brand that's bigger than that. That isn't super logo driven. Like even Hermes, which is obviously understated is still, there's some, a lot of those H belts. So, or H, H, whatever. Love, love H. Yeah. Or H, you know, a lot of H is so the question is, will they have to create something like that eventually? Or has the world changed enough that it, that it doesn't matter? And also, do they need to be bigger than a billion? The example this person said was Armani. But the thing about Armani is because there, there's no logo stuff in there. But the thing about Armani is they have a lot of, and or Ralph Lauren even, well, Ralph Lauren has the polo, but Armani has lower end lines that drive a lot of that volume. So, well, that's what beauty does for so many brands as well. Right? So, I mean, well, that would be exciting. That is what I need is a real lipstick. I mean, I think that they're, and certainly something for the eyebrow. Congrats to everyone involved. A fragrance, perhaps. I'm just saying, like, it makes a lot of sense when and if they choose to go there. Yeah, it'll be coming soon. And it'll be, it'll also be interesting if they choose on that front to partner with someone like a Pooge or if they do it on their own. I have this weird feeling they're going to do it on their own. But all this to say, what an incredible company for both of us. And, and two people to cover all this time. We're really lucky that we're in this era of fashion, I feel like. A lot of times it feels like we missed the boat. But in this case, we were like, right in the middle of it. And the fact that this has been a hub for so much additional design talent to come through. So, I mean, I think that that when you look at sort of like the pedigree of having a stint at the row and what they have hired smart people and creative geniuses who have then gone on to do their own things too. And now that has become like a major selling point of like all of these other brands that are coming off of like, oh, they had, they did their time at the row and then they went off to do their own thing. I see that within beauty. Half of the beauty founders started at L'Oreal. It is absolutely like one of those key incubators for people to really learn so much and then go off and do and many of them go off and do their own thing. I feel like that's the other part of it. When we're really thinking about influence long term as well is that like they're hiring really great talent, keeping it, growing it. And then those people are going off to do their own things. So it's like the influence is even more wide ranging in that way. And let's leave it with that. And everyone should buy Mary Kayne Ashley Olson's book influence. It is really good. Thank you, Lauren.
