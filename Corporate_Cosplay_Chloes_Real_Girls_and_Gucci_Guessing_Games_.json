And today with me on the show is fashion journalist Tish Weinstock. She's also the author of How to Be a Goth, Notes on Undead Style. Happy Tuesday, everyone. Last day of Paris Fashion Week. Last day of what was actually way more than a fashion month because of that long break between New York and London. I'm recording from the 11th around Esmant and I have to say it's been an exhausting and incredible week. So much has happened. I've learned so much. Much of it was reported in launching the last few days. Simone Bellotti finally was publicly confirmed at Joe Sander. I'm very happy for everybody involved. We're excited. But we're still waiting on this Gucci announcement. Hopefully by the time you listen to this, I will know for sure. But I have to say I kind of want to be surprised. I'm close to confirming, but I haven't yet. All these other announcements I've been able to confirm beforehand, part of me just wants to find out on Wednesday morning or Thursday morning when they announce and write from there instead of knowing ahead of time and publishing ahead of time and all that stuff. We'll see. It's been nice. Good for carrying a Gucci for keeping this so tight. I'm very impressed. Anyway, I also must absolutely recommend that you hit up the new Bodys store in Paris, which is one of the most beautiful stores I've ever seen. It's so great and it says so much about I think the future of that brand, which I'm sure I'll write about at some point in the next year. But it's really fabulous. Maybe I'll share some more Paris recs later this week, but I'd say that's my number one. If you're going to go to a store in Paris, you've got to go there. And let's get going with Tish. I love this conversation and I hope you do as well. Tish Weinstock, welcome to Fashion People. Thank you for having me. Very happy to be here. So you're still in Paris? I'm still in Paris. I'm definitely ready to go home. I was going to go home for a quick 24 hour hang with my kids, but then the World War II bomb happened. We're still suffering from that, which is a bit of a plot twist. So yeah, I stayed in Paris, but actually it was kind of magical. You know, and you'll quickly change all your plans and then you sort of have this weird, rare moment of free time. You're like, well, how do I actually want to spend my night now? Yes. So what have you seen? What have you been going to? I know that you contribute to System, right? So you do in other places as well. How much are you required to do while you're here? Thankfully, I'm not required to do much. I'm sort of, I am very much participating as a fan and someone to sort of, you know, I think it's being in the room at the show. This is a very obvious thing to say, but being in the room at these shows is a totally different experience to looking at it either online or even looking at the collection on vogue.com. Yeah. It's a completely different experience and it allows me to be part of the conversation when talking about what we're going to do for issues. Even if I'm doing things with other magazines, I think it's important to understand what's happening. Seeing people, seeing who's on the front row, seeing who is considered the it moment, seeing, I think it's the whole world and the world building because I think a successful brand is someone that has nailed not only the clothes coming down the runway, but the front row and who you have sat next to here. You're creating this world and if it's convincing, then it's successful in my mind. Because you want to be part of a gang as a consumer. You're like, oh, you look at maybe a Salaron show and you're like, wow, everyone looks very cool. I want to buy something from Salaron to be part of that club. For sure. I find it very valuable. I don't go to every single show, but I tried to go. Yesterday, I went to every single show and I was exhausted and wanted to die afterwards. It's cool. But most days, I go to a good amount, but not that many, probably three or four. But the thing that's so valuable and it is that thing about who is there. Yeah. Like, Scapparelli was the... Every fashion week, there's one show where I'm like, damn, I'm really glad I came. Not only because I thought the collection was nice and he's known for couture, but I thought that that was like an improvement on the ready to wear and a better idea of it. But Daniel Roseberry, not only does he have an incredible client base that comes to the shows, but also... They're amazing. They're looking at the clients and how they look. It's fascinating. Totally. And then also Delphine Arnaud was there. And then on top of that, the entire Saks Global team was there and they were even the chairman of Saks. And the breaker was there. And so that's the kind of reporting that, yes, it was also important for me to see that the clothes are... There's an incremental change in what he's developing, but you're totally right. What have you seen this week that you've been excited about? What have I seen that I'm excited about? I really... I was excited to be at Hyder's show for Tom Ford. I thought that was really special. It was like... Standing outside the show and seeing everyone gathered there felt like quite a special moment as well because there was just a lot of love for Hyder and everyone was like, God, I'm excited about it and it was going to be amazing. And it was so small and it was intimate. And then I was just really impressed by the casting in terms of the men. They just looked... I thought people... It was doing something different. And I think we love all the top models and seeing them, but I think it felt special seeing Hyder's vision come to life in the sort... Edie Campbell with white hair. Edie died and sort of shorn on both sides. Ethan James Green died his hair black. Henry Kitcher, he suddenly had like peroxide hair. It was Hyder's gang and then he changed them up and made them the sort of image that he wanted. And I just thought the tailoring was... I'd like to see more women than tailoring. I mean, she says not only a good suit actually, but it got me thinking about tailoring. Because it's... And actually I saw last night, Valenciaga, and it was just... For me, it wasn't the sort of... It was just a really sort of paired back show and it was like clothes for people to wear. And that's what I thought. I think seeing more wearable items because... Which I think that's important because we are the consumer and... I mean, who's buying these clothes? Which I think is the question that everyone's asking at the moment. Well no one for a while. So yeah, I think that's true. I thought Hyder's show was great. I liked Valenciaga a lot. I went backstage and did the scrum with Demna and he talked a lot about what looks normal. And I thought that's a really interesting... There are two examples of him. He did... I think it was during the LA show he mentioned in the scrum that he had dressed up in essentially like Laurel Piana clothes for a holiday with his husband to see what it felt like to just be like our quote unquote rich person on a holiday. And he talked about how weird he felt. And this time he said this collection kind of came out of... For Halloween last year, he had a suit made, a quote unquote normal suit in the traditional way and he felt for his Halloween costume and he felt so strange and wrong in it that he decided like he said for the last six months they basically have been playing with what's a normal suit to him and he was wearing a suit backstage which I thought was great. And I agree. I mean, I think a lot of people misunderstand his Valenciaga because the principles are actually close to Cristobal. And also, I mean a lot of the work too, but you can... The sort of more gimmicky or headline stuff is what ends up getting the attention. And I thought what was so great about it was there was just... It was kind of distilled. He's a great designer of clothes and the thing is, Vettemont, that means clothes, like the brand that he founded. So I really liked it. Another show I really liked was Chloe and you happened to walk in it. I do, yes. So how... Were you a model before you became a journalist? No, I'm like what I guess I'm calling a noddle because I'm not a noddle, but I'm being cosplaying as one. I've walked a few shows for friends in London, young London designers and that's always been fun. But all I mean now I'm walking for friends in Paris. But it was... I think Tramina is an amazing woman and I love her aesthetic. And when I... Weirdly actually, when I went to the show last season, was it? I went in to get my fitting for all the clothes and someone came down to get me and was like, oh, you're here for the fitting. I was like, yes, I am. And so she took me up. And we were having this chat about what I'd been up to and I was talking, I was like, oh yeah, I've done a few shows, but I think I might cancel these. And this woman was staring at me, she was like, as if I'd done something wrong. So it was being quite blasé about all these shows. I was like, something's not right here. It's not really landing, my sense of humour. And then she was like, wait, you fit to confirm. I was like, no, no, no, confirmed I'm attending. She was like, you're in the wrong place because she thought I guess I was a model going to like Ashley Brock Isle's floor. And I was like, oh no. And then this season I saw her and she's one of Ashley's team and she was like, how funny is it that you are on this floor now? I was like, yes, very funny. That is very funny. Ashley is the casting director, very famous casting director for those listening who don't know her name, but I'm sure most of you do. But no, it was a real joy. It was Alec, the other noddles was Alexa, Chung and Petra Collins. And then you had sort of the girls of the moment, Loli, Mona, Lulu. And then there was some gorgeous new faces. So it was a real sort of blend of people, but that felt quite like organic. Like, yeah, it's nice. As someone who watches shows, it is nice when you see a more interesting casting, someone that's a bit unexpected, like at the Burberry show, seeing Richard E. Grant. I was like, wow. It's special. And again, that's Ashley, but the meme you casting is always really interesting. You're sort of recontextualizing people and like seeing clothes on real people and characters. It lends a sort of like realism and character to the clothes. But then for some shows that doesn't work and you need the sort of Pierre Giorgio like army that he has. So it's interesting. I think you need it all really. And it's about creating that atmosphere and that world. But yeah, walking clothes was amazing, but I definitely, there was a moment where I was like, I can't do this. This is not. Maybe I should just not do this and go home. That was really an option. And then I was walking out and I was like, oh my God, I've gone the wrong way. This is a nightmare. And then I realized that she was the right way and I just hope that didn't really show on my face. But there was a moment when I walked down and my husband was in the audience with a lot of my friends and I could hear them like cheering me on. And she's which was very disconcerting, but amazing. It was I felt very supported. But I just had to dissociate. Otherwise I would turn and be like, hey, which isn't really a Chloe vibe. Yeah, that's break the fourth wall. That's not what they wanted. But yeah, it was very it was why I have to say why I love being a part of it is like meeting everyone backstage and becoming part of someone's world and really understanding the ideas behind it and being like lost in everyone's energy. Like it is quite an amazing experience to have. Maybe I don't need to walk, but I just want to be backstage. I did tell Chimina after us, I like maybe I should be an intern for Chloe or something so I can just come back. But I don't know how the rest of these girls do it. Like they're doing fittings until 1 a.m. And then getting on bikes to like have really early prototypes. This show is brought to you by Boca.

There was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out it was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th. Follow and listen on Apple podcasts, the Odyssey app, Spotify or wherever you get your podcast. I was sitting next to a really young model and her mom at lunch today at a rut. I don't know if you've been to Echo. They're in California. It's like a like avocado. It's cow. I live at very near Echo Park in Los Angeles. So it's very silly. But I was like, I need a place where I can do right and also eat avocado toast, essentially. But she was, I think they were British and the mom was definitely an ex-model and the girl was probably like 17, 18. And they were looking at the Durran Atlantic show. And it was so, and I don't, I couldn't tell if she had walked in it, but she said, what are they selling? It was so funny, which I ended up using it in my column on Monday. But like, I think that those clothes are actually, once you take out the wires and you flatten them, they're actually really appealing. And I mean, you can't do bareback jeans, but, um, but there, there's a real appeal, but, um, it was a funny conversation because I was thinking, I should have talked to them, but I didn't want to like, but in on the like intimacy of the mom and the daughter eating their avocado toast together. They were so excited. You respected the, the avocado, the boundaries around that. But it is such an interesting business now because like there are Chris and Scott Thomas walking at Mew Mew or whatever. And people, Alexa, I saw Alexa walk at Simone Rosha. Lex has been busy this season. Yes. Um, and it does add a different element to it, but it is still like that. Is a career. Like this girl was, she was out and about and doing her fittings. And, um, it's, it's wild. It is interesting. And it's, it's back to this idea of like wearability because you have, and I know obviously you're very excited about the new Chilisanda news. My God. Love him. When it came out, I felt like I was like, that's very, it made sense that it was on the day that I was speaking to you because I'm not a fan. But there's someone that makes real clothes, sort of like for real, well, not really like, you know, what, what is a real person? Like to what Damna was saying, what is a normal person? Um, but it's this idea of, um, things that one could see themselves wearing. Um, you know, every day, because I don't know, can you wear a pair of fake tits every day? No. Yeah. But you can enjoy the theater of it. Yeah. Like the fake, the bouncing, the bouncing boobs were funny, but I think in some way, not to be a party pooper, but I did ask him backstage. I was like, what, we're talking about Durand Lantik, everybody who showed a man with a woman, he opened the show with a woman wearing a latex shirt that looked like a muscular man. And he, I believe closed the show with a man wearing a latex shirt with varied large breasts, jiggling. And I, Jacob Gallagher just kind of went like, just started laughing. And what I would say is it was, I asked, I asked Durand backstage, like, what's the deal? And he said, well, I think it kind of speaks for itself, but the thing I wish I had followed up and said, but why did you lead with the man in the woman wearing them, the man's, I know it was interesting, but I think it took away a little bit from the clothes, which are, are interesting. And, and you mentioned Simone Bellotti, who was at Bali and I and a few other editors became like super fans of his work there. He was sort of had been promoted to the chief designer at Bali kind of unexpectedly, this other guy, Ruiji had been the designer and, and was left. And they promoted Simone and we all sort of just like totally fell for the, the collections. And I went to the, the store in Milan several times and there were like all those people there buying the boat shoes that he's made. And it, it, it is exciting to see a designer who makes, you know, he's interested in art and, and wants to do something. It's not conceptual. Like it, it could be conceptual, but it's more about taking all these ideas about art and design and applying them to realism in a way. What do you think generally about this, this appointment was expected, but like all the changes that have been happening at the houses? Well, I think it's a lot. And it's, it's kind of, it's another thing about like, when you know, you're at these shows and like you're in the room with everyone and going to all these other sort of like activations around the shows, like people are still, like the chat is very much like who's going where and people are like, oh, well, I had this and like, well, I had this. And like, it's funny to sort of get involved with those conversations, but it is a bit like, oh God, when is this going to end? And I think I wasn't in, in Milan this season, but you know, the vibe was everyone's like, oh yeah, no one went. And it's like, well, I think you need to sort of be respectful in these follow periods. Yeah. I don't know. And it's, I'm, there's a lot of sort of, yeah, there's a lot of anticipation and rumors and, and it is exciting because you start to imagine people, you start to cast people in various roles and like, oh my God, like, wouldn't this be great if this person did that? And I, you know, I know that the world sort of wants Hedi at Gucci, which a great Hedi that would be major. I think Hedi needs to be at a house, obviously, we need him. And what's actually really interesting is in London, there's this like Hedi cult where people are really obsessed with him. And it's like young people sort of dressing up as like the Hedi boy or the Hedi girl. And there was this weird, like Hedi convention, like someone posted on Instagram, you know how they did that? Timothy Shalame look alike competition. Yeah. But there was a sort of like, who is the Hedi boy man? And there was a sort of, yeah, it was like a meetup, which I saw on Instagram. I was like, you know, people love him and they want him and it's, he embodies this like youth culture in a way that not many others designers can. So it would be great to see him, him that I'd be very interested. I don't know if it'll happen. I don't know what the caring, the caring relationship is. Yeah, it's interesting because usually I really know. Yeah. And this time I don't know. And maybe, maybe by the time we publish this on Tuesday morning, I will have that information. I'm trying very hard. I know they're going to announce it this week. That, that I know, but usually I know, and I'm able to be like, I know this is going to happen, but this time I don't know. And, and I was convinced over the weekend that it was definitely Eddie. Cause I talked to some people in Milan who would have good access and they were acting like it. And then someone came up to me at a show and was like, it's Eddie. They're announcing on Wednesday, but then I heard today they're announcing on Thursday and the thing. It's so, it makes sense from a business perspective. Ye you would pay all the money in the world, no matter what happened between the company and Eddie 10 years ago or, or seven years ago, however long it was. Now you would, you would mend that relationship because he will make the stock price go up. Yes. But the reality of it is that's only going to happen if he wants it to. And also, I think caring is moving away from this idea that the creative director sort of is the director of the whole business, the whole project. Yeah. And, and so I think if he gets that job. Or if he, he took that job or whatever, that means that he is either going to give up a little bit of the control he usually has because it's not going to be grand. Exactly. So, so I don't know. It's because I really thought this weekend I was like, it does, it just makes the most common sense and we all want it and we all want to see it. But then. I don't think it's going to happen. I don't know why I just have the feeling that like. I mean, I would love to be proved, love to be proved wrong, but I, I, I have a feeling that he, he, I think maybe he's just going to enjoy taking pictures. Yeah. I think he might go like to sort of focus on that for the timing. I don't, I don't know. I don't have any insight into it, but it, it feels like he's, he doesn't need to go anywhere. No, no, he doesn't. And I, I was at a party in, at the WMAG party in LA in I guess, January. I don't even remember at this point thing was January. And he was there hanging out in Nicola, guess, Gare, which is a funny. Yeah. Interesting duo. Um, and Jamie Mizrahi, they are both friends. The three of them were sort of hanging out together, but, um, I was talking to someone there who knows him very well. And that person said, uh, he says he doesn't want to do anything. And so I think, look, like, why did he buy an apartment in Milan or whatever he did? Well, we won't know. Maybe he, who knows five years from now, he'd also be really great at Armani. He'd be great at a lot of different companies. I think that there is a chance that he has something in mind, but it's not going to be for a long time. Um, and I, I think you're right. Like I keep, I'm just really on the fence because I feel like the people who have told me it's him really know what they're talking about, but I also have talked to people who are close to him, who are like, it's not him. And, and so if it's not him, who is it? Is the real question that I, I'm like, I don't know. Well, I guess who else is in the running? Um, what is my blanking? The X Mimi guy. I think Dario, I think Dario's in the Vitalis in the running, but he is very engaged with Versace. So I think there would be, I think it's, he's probably the slim to none. The other two, well, there's three actually, I have heard Demna's name, which like, I think is not true. Um, yeah, I could, that would be very interesting. It'd be interesting. I think it's, it's not, it doesn't, I don't think it makes sense for him either. Um, and then I've heard this guy, Fabio, who worked at Prada Forever and left a year ago and is amazing. And so that, that one, to me, to me in my mind, it's, um, between his last name is Fabio Sember, Nardi, Zember, Nardi. Um, to me, it's between, and then the other person that keeps coming up is Peter Mueller or Mueller or, or what have you. I, I kind of hope that they surprise us and it's none of them. I would love a sort of like surprise door number three. Yes. It would be interesting. I think, you know, they need to, cause I guess that either, you either have a sort of, you know, the legend, do you have like a, a, any, or like Peter Nass, he's, he's, you know, what he did with the lie was obviously, or is still like very well received, like people love it. It's gorgeous. Um, so you either go for someone like that, or you do someone like a Fabio, someone who's like less, someone just really good at their job and, and could it's about like, personnel, like, do you want cause, cause, um, do you get an unknown or do you get like, you know, the star? And I think, you know, I kept carrying his proven recently that they like a little unknown, um, also what can they afford as well? There is that. For sure. That is a good point. And I think those brands aren't going to pay these gigantic fees or, you know, not yet. You got to, yeah. I think one interesting thing about Fabio is he knows friend Francesca Bellantini, who's the deputy CEO of caring and also Stefano Cantino, who worked a product for many years with him. So, um, the interesting thing about him is he's an unknown to the world, but he's not unknown to them. So he, you know, yeah. General public. So it might be the best, best solution. Yeah. Other people, I don't, I honestly, I truly do not know the answer to this one. And it's been extremely, honestly, very, very fun because sometimes I know, and I'm like, I know, I know, I know. And then eventually I get to prove it, but usually people are like, no, this, no, this, and, and so in this case, I still don't know. Um, Mariah, Mariah, um, Gretzky was also their name. I mean, obviously she's very much still at Dior, but people have said her name, but I think that sounds like it's a bit of a, they need someone there now, right? Yes. No. And I, and I think, I think she definitely spoke to them, but I, um, I would say it's not her. That's what I, that I know that. That's one of the things I know. But, but yeah, it's, it's been interesting. You ever hit that moment when your kid asks for help with homework and you're like, wait, when did long division get this complicated?

There was something I wanted to ask you about a friend of mine sent me this essay that this academic wrote in the New Yorker recently about like, and I, I, it really reminded me of what's happening in fashion right now. It was about essentially about, she uses the word literalist and essentially about like everything is so on the nose in film now that there's no room. It's just not as creative as it once was. And she mentions in the piece, like everyone wears Doc Martens, but nobody is a goth and I read it this weekend. I ended up mentioning, I don't know, it'll probably, it might get cut out of my, my column that I wrote on Monday. I really went off on a tangent, but, but it was interesting. I was speaking to you today because you wrote a book. Yes. It essentially called. How to be a golf, which is obviously a time in cheek. Because I mean, what is, what is a goth can subcultures truly exist in this age? I think, and are they sort of authentic and what does that look like? And I think it is. It's, it's a really interesting conversation. Thanks to like the internet, I think it's very hard to have these subcultures in the traditional sense. Like, and I think music and fashion have been sort of emancipated from each other in a certain way. Like, obviously you're seeing all the biggest pop stars in the front row, like music and, and fashion and all in your own campaigns, like music and fashion, that connection isn't going anywhere. But what I mean is you don't, what you wear is no longer that reflective of the music you listen to. And that's because you can listen to everything and nothing at the same time. Like I could be listening to classical, but also have my Britney Spears and, and also Tyler and one girl. It's a quick, you know, swipe of the butt. We're being bombarded with all these different references, the same references. And I think we're all becoming this sort of melting pot of these references. And I think my point about goth, gothism and like gothic nurse is basically it pertains to these. In particular, women who are drawn to a slightly darker aesthetic, but that doesn't necessarily mean they listen to specifically goth music. It's just an aesthetic. But also there's a it's, it's more than that. It's a sort of way of life. It's about women who do things differently and don't. You know, pertain to strict gendered stereotypes on how to be a woman. It's about women who are unapologetic, you know, about being themselves. But yeah, in this sense of subcultures, it is very hard to. The fact that back to Demna's show, he's doing he's he's he's doing normal people or he's looking at normal people like, well, what is normal? And actually what I what I saw a lot of I didn't go to the Stella McCartney show, but I saw it on Instagram. I saw, you know, sort of in the office and it was the same for the Duran show. Like, yeah, the work and work where and Demna, we saw a bit of kind of work where. And it's sort of like we are our work and we are our Instagram page. And we're all doing it's such we're all everything. Everyone's doing a bit of everything in the matter. The fact that I just want to show, even though I'm a writer and I think the categories that get categories are getting less defined and and it's much more fluid. So I think, yeah, we've definitely changed things. Things have changed. Yeah, really quickly on the work where thing I bought a Phoebe Filo suit on this trip. It's not as expensive as you would think people, especially here. And then you get the VAT refund. I I really don't like. Talking about my shopping because people are like, how are you doing this year? Insane, but I need it's like my one thing for the year or whatever. But anyway, I bought it. It's beautiful. And I love the suits in Balenciaga. I really I love I like the suits of Givenchy. I thought they were really beautiful. Obviously, Haider and what Tom Ford has to reckon with is this idea of like. Is Zenya generally people don't wear you don't have to wear a suit to work. Maybe you do if you work at LVMH and you're a CEO, you have to wear a navy Dior suit, but generally most people don't wear suits to work. I don't have to wear a suit to work. You don't have to wear a suit to work. And and honestly, like a lot of lawyers don't have to anymore. So what does that all mean? And I think it's very fascinating. Maybe it's like has to do with COVID and the bet. And now everybody's like having to go back to work and the culture of that. And fetishizing the suiting is very interesting. But it was it was crazy that the Stella show, then Duran and then Demna. All yeah, we're we're talking in conversation about like office culture when none of us really have to go to an office or a lot of us don't. And it's not really the same. But Coperni did the whole like gamers and that felt kind of like it was like a convention. It was this formal idea of people getting together, which feels more akin to work than like play, even though they're literally playing games. But I think yeah, it's post COVID, the return to work, the cult of busyness, this fetishization of being busy and exhausted and like, oh, God, I've it's rampant posting and content. I think we're all a bit. It's a commentary on all of that. Because everyone who I stay, whatever it is, fashion week and everyone who I've seen today is like, I'm so tired. Because like talking to people is so tough. I mean, it's awesome. You know, and it's but it's. You you're complaining if you're if you're not when there's like work is when it's a follow period, you're like something feels wrong. And like, you know, being on holiday, I don't know about you, but I'm definitely checking my emails and I'm getting to it. Getting enough please. I'm American. Yeah, but you're definitely checking my emails on holiday. Christmas and August. I find it quite miserable. I'm like, oh, me too. Yeah, I don't like I don't like the disc. I'm going to Japan and that's the only way I'm going to be able to do it because I'm going to be so far that I'm going to be able to actually disconnect in in April. But I'm curious when in the thinking and fleshing out your book and in thinking about these ideas thing I'm always was talking with some people about the Queen and Sean McGeer. And someone said, look, I thought it was a much better collection. He's getting there. And and I know for British people in particular, it's it's the hardest house. It's as hard as a lie or whatever to get right. But but the thing that they said was like, it just seems like he needs to like. Be out in the world and he he is. But we are all the thing I see with designers now is because of the fact that we live so much of our lives online and imagery is so instant and you can access anything that you can get. You can go on the internet and see the the photos from the shoot from 1955 that you want to see or you can watch Badlands or whatever and immediately get the reference. Whereas previously 30 years ago, you had to imagine what that was because you put or you go to the library and see it. How do you think like these subcultures and things that do feel in some ways to be dissolving and then in other ways reforming? Virtually. How do you think like? The human race can keep creativity going, not to get redeep or anything. I'm like, oh, this will be easy to answer. I think as is as we've seen historically, like. In time in like dark times, in times of like crises, creativity flourishes because of the urgency. There's an urgent need to create beauty or to create darkness as a way of coping with all of the darkness and into like frame it in a goth context. The reason why now is the moment to start talking about it is because you're seeing like the return of Wednesday, the return of Beetlejuice and Osforatu. Like all the and then in fashion, there was a dark aesthetic coming through. Then you sort of had the rise of like Gabrielle and like Amelia Gray and people want and people were bringing Mariakala back. Not that she ever really went away, but like people were leaning towards this like darkness because it was in a way soothing because the world is not well. As we know it, there's like a lot of scary stuff, particularly for you guys in America. What are you talking about? Yeah, just the hunch that things might be quite difficult over there. So I think in times of strife, creativity does flourish. And I think the internet is a blessing in a car. So I think it's like definitely, I think there's something to be said for, you know, when you have all these references at your fingertips, they get really sort of fatigued and like boring and you just, you remove them from their initial context and they sort of take away some of the urgency about them or the radical thinking behind them. So they they get a little bit like an ethatized. But I think that will just inspire designers, creatives, artists to look further and to look in more obscure places. I believe maybe I'm being really optimistic here, which is not actually in my nature. I'm a real pessimist, but I'm hoping that it will drive people to find better better references, because you hear a lot these days of photographers being like cannibalizing each other and being like, oh, yeah, I want to do a shoot inspired by this Maizel shoot. I'm like, why Maizel did it and did it amazingly. Like think about something else that you need to move the conversation on. And I think it's hard unless you're doing something, you know, interesting, recontextualizing it in an interesting way, but a copy and paste. What I think is it because we're seeing what I think is we'll see more bad work, but the good work will really rise to the top. So we'll see more stuff. And we'll be able to sort the wheat from the chaff like the cream rises to the top. And I think that you have to get, you know, through it. You have to just wade through it. And that's up to you as the viewer or the consumer to to define what is good and what is bad or what you like and what you don't like. I hope you're right. Yeah, me too. Tisha, it was such a pleasure to have you. Are you going to shows tomorrow? Will I see you at all? No, no, I've got to go and see my children. OK, I understand. Mine, mine came here, so I get it. How's that? I did that once and it didn't go to plan. My husband is is available. Let's put it that way. So yeah, yeah, it's been it's good. And we just have one. That makes it easier. Oh, OK, yeah. Yeah, that's different. And he's four. He's like he's pretty easy. He came to Sakai this morning, which was very cute. Oh, what do you think? He should come on the podcast. He loved it. He really enjoyed it. He he shook Vanessa Friedman's hand. He said he really liked the the look with the red bag, which there wasn't one. So I think he meant the red dress, but he had a great time. That's quite amazing. If he's like maybe he's this sort of genius and he was just sort of messing with these like, don't you think the red bag's great? It's like the other person you close and you're like, yeah, love. He's very funny, but it was such a pleasure to meet you. And I hope we meet in person next season. Yeah, definitely. And read Tisha's book, How to be a Goth, notes on undead style. Thank you. Thanks, Lauren. Have a safe, have a safe ride home. Fashion People is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck.
