Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I am Lauren Sherman, writer of Puck's private email about the fashion industry called Line Sheet. And today with me on the show is Fabiola Berkassa Beckman, the producer behind fashion documentaries like The First Monday in May. And this year, Diane von Furstenberg, a woman in charge, which premieres on Hulu June 25th. Fabiola is also a couture expert and client. We cover everything, filmmaking, the culture of couture, and we even go back to her days interning for Carl Lagerfeld and hanging out with John Galliano at Bungalow Eat. It's a fun trip, so let's get started. Hi, everyone. Happy Friday. I am off to northern Europe tonight for a family break. Yes, I love not too hot weather. So I love northern Europe. It really works with our family dynamics. So we're going to sneak away to there for a few days. And then I am heading to Paris for a week and then Milan for a little bit, mostly doing meetings, as I mentioned with Liz Goff. But I will be out and about a bit and I hope to see you. If you want to hang out, let me know and let's try to make it work. It'll be very fun. I wish I could live in four places at once, but I don't. So these little trips, I try to make the most of them. This week in Line Sheet, I doled out a bit more. Chanel Intel had an update on Neiman and Sax. And you may be most interested on Thursday. I wrote about the one and only Jonathan Anderson and his role in the LVMH ecosystem. So he is obviously the designer of Loewe, but also his own line. And there's been stuff going on with his own line that I have a bit of new information on. And more than anything, it's just interesting to watch as all these executive changes happen and there are all these empty designer spots. What a company like LVMH does with a talent who's arguably their most important talent. He is critically beloved. He is commercially successful. And also he is quite young. I think he's around 40. So he has arguably 40 more years of work in him. So how are they going to keep him happy? I think is a question that a lot of people have. He's done an incredible job at Loewe. He could work there forever. But I have a feeling he has bigger ambitions than that. So check out that story. And as mentioned, I have Fabiola Bercasa Beckman on the show today. And it was such a pleasure afterwards. She was so generous with her time, but also she sent me all these images, Polaroids of her time interning for Chanel as a teenager, some of the Galliano dress she wore to the Met After Party in the 90s, which we discuss on the show. And also some pictures from Liz Tobaris, the Harpers Bazaar editor-in-chief who passed away in the late 90s, actually. Some pictures of her book party, which was hosted by Fabiola's mother Veronica Hearst. Obviously, Harpers Bazaar is owned by the Hearst family. And Ron Perlman, who was the other co-host, just if you were curious, the Four Seasons restaurant. Susan Magrino did the PR. She sent me the pamphlet. It was like, nothing has changed and everything has changed. And Veronica wore this incredible Dior couture suit. And in the photo, it's like a picture of Veronica and Liz. And Liz is wearing a black shell, black pants, and a marled gray sweater thrown over her shoulders. And it's very like, OK, this is why I was obsessed with this woman, because it feels very cabmate, as we like to say these days. I was a very big fan of Liz's. So talking to Fabiola about that time, it's really special. I hope you enjoy. And I hope you have a great weekend. Send me tips, texts. I love all the feedback. We'll talk soon. Fabiola, thank you so much for being on Fashion People. It's so nice to finally meet you. So before we get into it, the first question I always ask is, what did you have for breakfast? Oh, that's a really, really good question today. I had eggs, but really, it was not my first meal, because that's what my kids had for breakfast. And I had leftover dumplings from last night for like mid-afternoon snack. This is the best answer that we've gotten. Look, here's my morning. I woke up with my kids. We had eggs. We made eggs. They ate them. I sort of scavenged the eggs. Then one of my children, because I have three, had to play at school. So I ran up to school to watch the play, ran back down. What starving had you? And I just wolfed down some leftover dumplings from last night. Amazing. I love it. That's why. Most people have been like, I didn't eat, or they are like, I had some toast with an egg or egg only. I did. And I had some green juice and a nice coffee somewhere on the way after school that I picked up. So yeah. That sounds delicious. So it's only 1.30 in New York where we're both chatting right now. So you've done a lot today already. That's insane. That's not even all. There was more, but I won't get into it. So the person that I first heard about you from is Thomas Orinado. Oh my gosh. Thomas. Years ago. Because I don't know if you worked on a project with him or you were just good friends. But this is probably over 10 years ago that I remember he brought you up to me and was like, she's so fabulous. And how do you two know each other? You know, we know each other from the scene in New York, right? I mean, he's been on the scene for as long as I can remember. And you know, he really has my heart. He's such a kind, wonderful person who is willing to give his time and be a good friend. He's wonderful. I was just thinking about the fact that he wrote that book about being, he was like a bouncer or something or a door man. What are the velvet rope clubs? Like his book was called something like behind the velvet rope or something like that. I've never read his book, but now that you have told me, I will read it for sure. I think he sent it to me or I bought it years ago or someone sent it to me. Thanks for what you said. He's the best. Well, so I've been hearing about you for years and then we got put in touch by Elizabeth Von Der Golds who mentioned obviously you just produced this documentary, DVF A Woman in Charge. Have you seen it? Yes. Yes. But they, yes, Hulu and about 15 other people have sent me the links. It is. I've made four, almost five, I guess, movies. And I've never worked with a platform like Hulu. It's just a huge machine. I mean, it's like, yeah, it's amazing to have that kind of support. How was the event on Wednesday night? It was the premiere, right? Yes. It was the premiere. We, you know, we opened the Try Back a Film Festival, which is just a super amazing feat. And like we had submitted it and we hadn't heard back from them and so many other filmmakers that we knew had heard back and they were slotted in. So like for a period of time, we were like, maybe they didn't like it. I guess it's not for us. And I remember like getting on this call with Hulu and they were like, we don't need a festival. It's fine. And everybody, but then of course we got opening night, which was such an honor. You've done five movies at this point? Well, one is never came out. So I would say four, but five. It still counts. You did the work. You did the work. So I want to talk to you about how you got into that industry. But first, you have such a rich history in fashion. You've done so many different things. You have, you've had such an interesting career. You also are a couture client, which I feel like is like being also a job in some ways. It's just like, how did you first develop an interest in fashion and get your first internship, which is, is not the kind of internship that, and you know, it's so funny when I started this podcast. I don't want to talk about people's journeys, blah, blah, blah. I want to hear about your journey because, because it's worth telling. By no merit of my own, I was born with a fashion spoon in my mouth. So I can't, you know, I can't take credit for that. I was born, my mother's Veronica Hearst and she was just like a fashion icon. I don't know if you know much about her, but you know, the woman was pin cushioned in couture day in and day out. She was just, you know, this incredible sort of icon of all things couture. So that, that's what I, that was the world I was born into for better or worse, by the way, because you can imagine that in so many ways that's like a wonderful thing. And in some ways it can be very debilitating. The standards are so high, especially as a young woman growing up in that industry. You know, you don't know, like I remember one time, Karla, I was told me I had a commercial body. So, you know, you just don't know, like what's normal. That is such an interesting like half dig, half compliment. Yeah. I mean, I mean, I think, you know, Carl was just so, you know, as we all know, as anybody who has ever heard him speak, just so controversial to spoke his mind. I mean, he certainly wasn't PC in any way, shape, or form. So, so yeah. So my mother was a client, a couture client. And when I was in high school, you know, she would go to Paris in the summers for the shows and she would take me with her. And she didn't really want me in her hair. So I was like an annoying teenager. And so she just had me intern, you know, she just called Chanel up and was like, my daughter is here and she's going to intern for you. So she had me interned to it would be two weeks every summer. I would do like the root combo. And I was basically Carl's at the time. I was basically his version of email. So I would, I would like, it was the time when he had the fan and he was like a more heavy set and the sunglasses and the long, you know, pony. And he would just be like, Fabiola, Fabiola, take it up to the atelier. And then I would go like he would do a drawing and then I would run it up to the atelier and like run back down and show him and then show the seamstresses and then show him. So I did that a lot. And I did a lot of Polaroids, you know, model Polaroids, you know, boards, Polaroids, like, you know, the sequence of the models going down the runway and all that stuff that like you need people for. Did you, obviously this world was not, it was something that you it wasn't, it wasn't unfamiliar to you. But what, like, what, how did he operate? Did he have a ton of people around him? Yes. And did everybody have like a very specific role? Or. Yeah. And, and how was he with each, like, how were his employees to him? Were they really differential or was it more collaborative? Like, what was the environment like? The people that I remember most, of course, were like Andre Leontali was always there with him and like, Vitoire, who was doing jewelry. And then people who were collaborating with him, like Philip Tracy was doing hats, you know, or any kind of millenry. I guess that's the word for the, for the shows. And like all the, you know, the people that would come in and do the accessories for the show. So that's what I remember most. I mean, I think like the, the, the petit mâin is what we call them. I guess the seamstresses and stuff. They fit, they were all there from forever. The nicest, like little old French ladies, mostly, you know, these crafts that are completely lost today. Um, yeah, they definitely deferred to him in like. I only remember him getting in an argument once with one of the, uh, seamstresses where she was like, I can't do that. I can't make it that way. And he was like, yes, you can. Would you do this in the lead up to the couture show every season? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. When was the first time that you got fitted for your own piece of the very first time was for my brother's first wedding. My brother Carlos is first wedding. Uh, I went with, uh, my mom and with Andre to the house of Chloe, which Carl was designing at the time at Chloe and got fitted for a dress for my brother's wedding. So this is like the nineties. The nineties. Yeah. Can you explain, and I'll, I mean, I would say probably two other people who listen to this are going to have had this experience. So it will be interesting to a lot of people, like the difference between going and getting a couture piece made versus like a custom piece. Uh, it's never been my, uh, believe it or not, not really my experience. And I'll tell you why my mother, uh, you know, was, uh, is because she's still of course with us, but was, I'm talking about her in the past tense, uh, you know, five, nine, almost five, 10, like a, you know, a wafy lady. And she prided herself very much in buying the runway samples of the couture collection. It was one of her, you know, shining accomplishments. And so, you know, having something made was not something that she liked to do necessarily. And I occasionally, she would have something altered, something changed, so they made, but she really loved the idea. And so I did that. Chloe was a runway sample and it was modified and it was modified. Uh, yeah. So, so, but, but, but what is the difference? So the, so the difference is the following. I mean, but I know it because I've worked so many with so many couture clients, you know, first of all, you, you see something go down the runway, you want it, you have it made for you. Um, and they tweak it, of course, to your body and your measurements and everything like that. They have a, if you are like our long standing couture client, they have an actual, uh, form of your body, like with your measurements, uh, where the clothes gets fit and made. And so, um, that's also just amazing to see, like watching them pad like, uh, you know, a form and then, you know, most houses will only make it for one person. So that's it. Once it's been purchased, you can't have another one. So they won't do like five of the same dress. No. Wow. So is there like a lot of competition right after to get the order in? Yes. And in fact, I witnessed, I, I witnessed that. I'd never witnessed that as much on Chanel because I really wasn't part of the, the clients side of things, but I did want to go to a Dolce and Gabbana, Alta Moda show in, where were we? In Lake Como. And they, you know, amazing. And, and it was crazy. And they, because I was at the time trying to do a documentary on Stefano Domenico, which I was this close to doing. And then it fell, fell apart, unfortunately, but there's still time. Uh, there's always time. It's the long game filmmaking. Um, so anyway, so there I was and they're very smart marketing geniuses, you know, at Dolce. And so what they did was, um, that after the dinner, they had all the couture samples in this fabulous room in a Palazzo and everybody could go in and try them on. And the mad rush after people were not even eating, they just got up, they were like, forget what time dinner's over. Like I'm going in there. It was like, nobody was sitting at the dinner. All the ladies were just like be lining for the clothes and everybody was, nope, I tried on first. I mean, there was like pulling of, of like, yeah, it was crazy. This show is brought to you by Boca.

If like three women want the same down, will they say, OK, this person has been like spent with us more. So we're going to somehow make sure that she's the one who gets it or how do they manage that? I can't answer that. My personal experience, I've never been part of the decision making to be honest on that. So but by, but from what I've sort of gathered, definitely. I mean, it's also very, very much like case specific and house by house. But yeah, definitely like a long standing client is going to get preferential treatment. And also if the client is somebody that the house really wants to be affiliated with or associated with that, that can help a lot too. Understood. And so are you also a collector yourself? Yes. And what what are some of the sort of themes in your collection? Like brands or or types of pieces or what have you? I think the major theme in my collection is nostalgia for me. Just having grown up in that world and and you know, it's there's a familiarity, like a childhood. I don't know how many people can say that, but I can say that there's like a childhood familiarity for me. And my mother was never very much like an Oscar de la Renta, Carolina, like Ralph Lauren, like Americana fashion girl lady, I would say. She was very much like Chanel, Dior, Goatier. She was a little more avant garde in her style. So that's really what I gravitate towards at the end of the day. It's just because it's what I know. Are there any pieces that are like the one that you're going to donate to the museum? Or I've donated pieces to the museum. Which what have you what have you donated that's been in a show? Anything I don't I don't know that either have been in a show. Well, I've donated a few pieces. So I've donated I donated my wedding dress. What which was Chanel or Ricardo T. She first got she OK. I donated my wedding dress to the Met before I had a daughter because I had a surprised daughter at 44, which is a blessing. Congratulations. That's amazing. She's four now. And and I donated one of the dresses that I wore at my wedding, which was a tattoo hand painted dress. Patu, one Christian, that was there that I got from Rita, Lily at sea, who's like, you know, best of the best. And a madam gray that that my mother donated. But like we you know, I was like, you have to donate this madam gray. So yeah. And Lily at sea is a store that sells vintage pieces. Yeah, I mean, she's got the best the best pieces, I would say. Ricardo T. She Givenchy Couture. Yes, such a moment. And I just remember and the like sort of neon. And when he did that show where it was, they were all kind of positioned. I don't know. I don't know if it was actually an actual runway, but all the photos were all like them posing all together in a group. But it was just like a revelation, a revelation. When you first saw that stuff where you just like I have to have be a part of this, I was blown away by by him, by how avant garde he was, by how inclusive he was, by, you know, the the creativity, the process and sort of that edginess that I I really admired in in his in his presentation. So yeah, I was blown away. So you grew up in this world. You were essentially born into this or I love born with a fashion spoon in my mouth. That's great. And then you interned at Chanel and you're like first work experiences in this world. What did you do next? And how did you get into working in the business as well? So from like, I mean, I have, by the way, later on you want any Chanel like anecdotal stories once I got stuck in in that famous root component elevator with like the it's like this big and it's got like that, you know, I don't know what you call it, like that gated door that they have in the front. Me and Naja Aouerman for like an hour plus in that time. I mean, I was like the height of her leg in that elevator. It was yeah, there is a lot of of Carl and funny stories there. But the next the next place I went was Dior. I went to Dior and, you know, it's funny because Delphine was at Dior. She had just started at Dior and she was doing the Delphine Arnaud, who is now the CEO of Dior. No, yes. And she was doing the footwear and and I remember actually when she and we, you know, we became friendly through this. I mean, I was like, nobody doing like any and all tasks, but I moved up a bit because I was there for several years. But we became friendly through the process. And when she did become, you know, now working now back at Dior from Louis Vuitton, I wrote her and I was like, congratulations and all that. And she goes, I said, I remember when we first met. And she's like, I can't believe you remember that was really the start of of my career. So that was a fun time. What were you tasked with there? At the beginning, it was just like anything, you know, bring a garment bag, take a garment bag, bring the shoes, do this. And then I moved into like celebrity dressing. I moved into, you know, events, events, coordinating. But a lot like very much dealing with celebrity dressing, but for the most part. And with John, you know, a lot. Yeah. Were you were you close with him? Yes, I was close with him and Alexi, who I love very much. And, you know, those were days where we were working and I was like, you know, I was based in New York, but I speak fluent French. So I would go and work also in Paris. And I was like taking a sample to like Ellen Pompeo or like Misha Barton or something and, you know, just like having it was the time where it was all, you know, those bias cuts, cut dresses with a thousand buttons down the side. And like my fingers were just worn down to the bone and trying to like dress these ladies with like it was just. But the fun of it was really that it was like a family. We were like a little family because we would do the work and then we would go to like bungalow eight, you know, every night with like John and like Misha and like, you know, Alexi and like my boss at Dior and like anybody else who was involved. And so it was just it was a very fun time. What did you think about? Did you see the John documentary? The high low? Yes. What did you think of it? I thought it was very honest. Yeah. And I thought it touched a lot of important topics for him. Yeah. That's a good way to put it. It felt like it didn't hide who he was. No, but it was also not unkind to him. Correct. And I think having, you know, and I don't want to get into like a like a geopolitical such a good discussion, but like being Jewish and like also having worked with John, you know, sort of in my formative years and loving him very much as a designer and as a person and, you know, just thinking that he's an absolute creative genius. You know, I just, yeah. So I think you're generally, I know him as a person. I think he was in a really bad place. I think that you're better than your worst day. So I want to ask how you got into documentaries. But before that really quickly, you have so much experience with fitting clothing and seeing clothes being fit on your body, on other people's bodies. And you obviously have been dealing with a lot of people who have, you know, bodies that might be a little easier to fit clothing. But what I have learned in the last, in the last year even, and you kind of know this, but you don't really think about it, even if someone is quite thin, it doesn't mean that it's clothes fit them easily because everybody's body is so different. And I'm just curious, like, what is the toughest thing when you're trying to fit a gown or a garment for one of these and make it fit correctly? Like, what is the thing that would come up again and again when you were working on these things that was just like a universal challenge or not universal, but like the thing that kind of always became an issue or was the thing that you had to address more than anything else? I mean, in my experience, it's all about proportion. So I would say that I would say, like, if the waist isn't falling where it needs to, it's not really doing what it needs to do. If the hemline isn't where it should be. And that's where it changes because people, some people have longer legs, some people have shorter legs, some people have a longer waist, some people have a shorter legs, some people have a shoulder here and a shoulder there. And it's where it's where the pieces fall in proportion to each other in order to make everything be harmonious. For me, it's proportion. What do you think about? I was talking to a VIP publicist this past week, and she was, we were discussing the fact that some brands, a lot of their gowns, their custom and their corseted. So the internal corset and there is, I don't know if it's a trend, but some of the really big labels that are, perhaps don't have a couture element to the, there's no couture house or couturier within the business. They are not as focused on that. And that's sort of become a, this brand, my friend who does VIP for this particular brand, the brand is just on fire on the red carpet. And she was like, I really think it's because when we send the gown, it usually fits because there are all these other mechanics involved. And she's curious what you think about that sort of trend moving away from the technical and sort of offering something that's perhaps a little less custom. Do you have any opinion about whether or not that's like a good or bad thing or it doesn't matter? I think that fashion history repeats itself. And what you're telling me reminds me very much of what Coco Chanel did. Right. Like it seems very similar to sort of freeing women up. I'm all for all for freeing women up. So I think that, yeah, I mean, I think, listen, I think there's always going to be a time and a place for a corset and this quintessential grog rain belt in the center of a dress that is so important for cinching a waist. But I also agree that women should be able to find clothes that look good, that fit them, that give them, that takes them 10 minutes to put on and give them time to do more important things in their day. Really, we'll get to the subject at hand. But what are you wearing? You have a beautiful, I don't even know how to describe the color. It's like it's not burgundy. It's ox blood. Little puff sleeve and a button up blouse and puff sleeve jacket and a button up blouse. It's so beautiful. Thank you. It is I had to Google what it was because I before I I actually wore this this morning to go to my kids play. So I but I did think I did think of you. It's amazing. It's so beautiful. I would have never known. You remember the collection that like that got that iconic shoe with like the flower? So sort of burgundy flower. You know, I have that. Please. Yes. Oh, I love live action on the podcast. Fabiola is going to her closet to show me the shoe. Oh, my God. Yes. Remember this? Oh, wow. It's yes. How many you think that's like four inches? Three and a half. And it's like a thicker heel and there's a branch with flowers going up in that same ox blood color. Wow. Yeah. Wow. It's beautiful. So that's from that. This is from that collection and it has a skirt. You look great. And it just shows that when people have personal style like the brand, you wear the brand, the brand doesn't wear you. So it looks it looks beautiful. That's a compliment. Thank you very much.

So let's talk about your work. How did you get from bungalow-y fitting Misha Barton to making movies? OK, so what when I was my paternal grandmother was like a big supporter of the arts, she was a patron of the arts and she founded something called the Montpellier Music Festival in New York. She was a big fan of the art and she was a big fan of art and she was a big fan of the Montpellier Music Festival in France. She got a Legion of Honor for all her contributions to the arts in France. And she was one of the first people to commission Gio Ponti to build her house in Venezuela. This is leading up to how I got into filmmaking. So when I would go and visit her, which was very often, her name was Allegria, she always had an artist in residence, always, always. And when I moved out of my parents' home and had my sort of first apartment in New York, I always had an artist in residence couch. That's how I got into art. And you're one of the founders of the whole gallery? I am. I am. I mean, I don't have a lot of involvement in it now, but I still am and was certainly at the time, there's only so much that one can do in a day. Three kids later. So I always had an artist in residence couch and I would have friends and artists and people say with me, everybody from like Tallulah Harlech stayed with me to, you know, artists like just like rungy artists that like were trying to get their start in New York. And one time I had a friend named Richard Raymond staying with me, who was a filmmaker from London. And he was working on a film and he didn't have a place to, you know, he didn't have money to stay somewhere. And we were reading the newspaper in the morning and there was a story on a dancer in Iran who wasn't allowed to dance because of the policy in Iran is you're not allowed to dance, which is just insane and crazy, but true. And we talked about it's true. Yeah. And so we talked about, you know, buying the rights to the story and all of a sudden I just started producing this movie with him because he had no money. And I was like, let me help you. And I literally asked backwards, fell into production. But I mean, I guess I had been producing all that time, you know, in fashion really. So it's not that different. And it's it's creative. It's creative production. I'm not like a line producer. I'm not doing budgets. So other than helping financially, are you like helping them find more other people to help fund it and also? Oh, oh, no, I mean, I was producing. No, no, I'm on the ground like every which way. I'm just not doing like line production, but I'm like helping find the people for the film, like the locations, like all the stuff, you know, and just coming up with ideas. Yeah. And also, I'm sure using your network to find people. Yes. And I also help raise money. You know, it's the gamut. It's whatever really is needed. There's just nuts and bolts are not my expertise per se. That first film sort of fell in to not fell into your lap, but like it came to you. Was the next one something that you wanted to do and you set out to do it? Like how did it evolve from there? I want to just come back to that because it it I was very interested in filmmaking. And so when, you know, I was like, we saw this article in The Times and I was like, let's try and do this. And I kind of wanted to try and do it. It didn't just like fall in my lap. And to say that I had also like been searching for more meaning in my life at that point, because and this is a human rights film, right? It's got Frida Pinto's lead. You know, I grew up in the world of fashion, as you know. And at one point I took it for granted and I thought, oh, this is just so like, you know, vapid and what else is there? And I was really looking for more and I went through a golf phase and I had a tongue ring. And if you look like just like it was my personal rebellion against like all the things that I kind of had experienced in my life, I'm sure in the bowels of the Internet, there's lots of that. And then I have like, you know, I was blonde. Wait, you can we go back really quickly to the goth phase? What were you wearing? I mean, I was just trying to be very edgy. You know, I like I said, I had a tongue ring. I would wear like, you know, chains like chains and chains on my waist. And like I was, you know, I would like powder my face. So just like, like pasty white. And, you know, I just wanted to I wanted to be more. I wanted to be different. I wanted to like experience something else. That's that's interesting. So you became interested in film at the same time you were like sort of finding yourself. Right. I was and I was and I and I think I I moved away from I had a lot of phases. So I had like the sort of social like quintessential socialite phase, which I was sort of thrust into with, I don't know if you remember like that whole social rank and all that. Yes. Oh my God. I totally forgot about those. Remember those? Do you remember that like brother and sister? Do I remember? I mean, I was on that. What happened to them? Did they were you like, did you interact with them at all? Or were they? No, I mean, sort of socially see them peripherally. I mean, nobody knew it was them until the very end. They were like they were very unique. Yes. But that was the first, you know, it was really the first time that any sort of social people had been on the internet. I mean, really, it was the first like foray into that. And it was it was a very strange time. And and I was blonde and very tan because that's what, you know, at that time, what I thought I needed to be, right? Because I felt like, oh, I was terror read or whoever was like the girl at the time. So, yeah, so lots of phases and got blonde and tan. Oh, that's just looking for more meaning. And I learned, you know, that I really was interested in a lot of causes and sort of human rights and social impact. And I really went in that direction kind of hard. I took a trip with the IRC to Jordan and Lebanon, stayed with them. We did like two weeks in in a refugee camps, which was a very difficult thing to experience and all of that. I mean, you know, like I really went hard. And then I realized that I had I had to marry the two because my love of my love of fashion and sort of this world was pulling me back. So that's how I started making fashion documentaries, but that touched upon topics that I think are really important. So what came next? What came after? So Desert Dancer being a human rights film, I also made a documentary called Meet Me Halfway about the overconsumption of animal products on the planet. And, you know, sort of promoting something called the reducitarian movement, which is about not like all or none, but like reducing your consumption, which is something I live by. And it works for me because I buy so much vintage anyway. So like I feel like my, you know, my consumption is reduced. And then I went on to do first Monday in May. Yeah. So that was obviously huge. And it was about the Met Gala and but also about Vogue. And it wasn't it was what seven or eight years after the September issue. So it was almost like felt like a little bit of a sequel type thing. But there was none of the people involved in the September issue were involved in in yours, right? No, no, none. So how did you come up with that concept and approach all the players, the Met and all of that? Like that must have been so complicated to get the Met to do that. You are spot on. I mean, that was everything's hard in filmmaking, I have to say. But that was one of the hardest because the Met had never let cameras into their museum ever, ever. And that's because, you know, there's so many works on loan. You know, God forbid, like you mistreat something or something happens, like there's just so much at risk. You know, defaming the Met is not something that even inadvertently, you know. So I think one of the well, Silvana, I'm sure. Yes, of course. Silvana for days at Vogue. And I like sort of cooked it up together. And and I think that one of the things that was really because they had tried, Vogue had tried to make that that documentary before and it failed. I think one of the things that was to my benefit is that I had a longstanding relationship with the Costume Institute and I think they trusted that I understood how to respect them and how to convey the Met in a way that was, you know, appropriate and respectful for the institution. So that helped. Why did you want to do that specific, tell that specific story? At the time, you know, I just I thought it was such an insider event and I also was very interested in telling the story of Andrew Bolton, you know, because the truth of the matter is, and like I was saying earlier about marrying some of those topics, it's a portrait of a curator. It is and and it may very well be a gala. It's kind of a Trojan horse. You know, you go to go see the fashion and the glitz and the glamour, but you leave knowing what a curator does. And also, there's a lot of geopolitical topics in the film, you know, with the Chinese-American relationships and like there's a lot there to unpack that isn't just fashion. And that really interested me because that was at the time where I started wanting to marry my worlds and figure out a way to like bring topics like like marry all the things I love and care about. Just for anyone who hasn't seen First Money in May, I'm sure many of you have, but it is about the Met Gala lead and the exhibition China through the Looking Glass, which was when you look back, I mean, I think the thing we all remember is that Rihanna dress, the yellow dress. Well, but prior to the show, there was like a lot of conversation around. Can you explain a bit what what the tensions were that the show dressed in that the film addressed? Yes, absolutely. I mean, I think there was this idea of not not portraying modern China, which was, you know, really not something that the Chinese were happy with because if it was China through the Looking Glass, then it should be China through the ages and not just sort of the quintessential sort of almost, I guess, appropriation of China. I don't know if I'm using the right word or if that's a little harsh, but they wanted it to be more robust in its representation. And I think that it was very much, you know, sort of the old world, China, that we're all we can envision the blue and white vases, etc. Interesting. And in the end, that was a very successful exhibition. Correct? Exhibition, yes. Very successful. I think the most visited behind McQueen, maybe, or maybe the most visited actually. It's incredible. I thought this past this this most recent one that's still on at the Met, so anyone who it's probably what is it probably on through the end of July or end of June or September, but I thought that this exhibit, I don't remember the name, it's in the Garden of Time or something. Or was that the theme of the I just thought this exhibit was incredible. Unbelievable. And they had like a olfactory component to it this time for the first time ever. So I thought that was super interesting. I mean, I have to credit Anna for just being a genius and taking it. I remember another little bit of fashion history. I remember the year that Lady Di went, which was 1996. She went with Elizabeth Tilberis, which was the editor-in-chief of Harper's Bazaar at the time. She has come up on this podcast several times already. I was I was in Pittsburgh reading her Harper's Bazaar, wanting to move to New York and beat and work for her. So. She was really. She was. Oh, yeah. I was such a huge fan. It was just I was blown away by her and that it was just for me. Like my personality, that was I wanted to be the fashion news writer at her Harper's Bazaar. You know, being the daughter of Veronica Hearst, right? Obviously at the time. Exactly. Yeah. She was a very big part of my life. Because she was always at my house. What was she like? Oh, God, she was just honestly the loveliest, sharpest, brightest, but also very kind, but but sharp, you know, really sharp and and peppy, upbeat, happy woman. So, you know, we lost her way too soon, for sure. And were you at that Met Gala when Princess Di? So that's what I was going to say. I went to the after party. I was 20 years old. And yeah, and I wore a that I wore that year was at Scaliano dress that I recently just rewar that Zendaya just wore a version of it was like a white knit version of it. I have the black one. I posted it on my Instagram. I've had it for 20 years. And yeah. Yeah. So but I really credit Anna. She's just such a genius, you know, because those were, you know, I mean, it was a big event, of course. Lady Di went to it. But it was just another event in New York. You know, what she's done. I mean, what she's done, let me give you a little anecdote. What she's done is like just like mind blowing. The other day I took my eight year old son, who's in third grade to the Museum of Transportation, I did like, you know, I've been. Yes. Oh, you've been. Yeah, I have a three year old. All right. So there you go. I found that those wicker seats on trains were so chic. I agree. They were like so like Jean-Michel Franck. I thought that was fabulous. But anyway, so I took my son to to this. I chaperoned the class and like his third grade classmates were like, your mom goes to the Met Gala. We were on the bus riding and I was like, holy shit. How did what happened? Your mom goes to the Met Gala and all the little girls would come up and giggle and he was like, you went to the Met Gala, you went to the Met Gala. And I was like, whoa, like where? Like, wow. Like, yes. It's remarkable. She made fashion pop culture. Yes. She really did. Yes. She's the Andy Warhol of fashion. Like he took a Campbell soup can and, you know, sort of brought it into, you know, the world of pop culture and she just made something. It was really interesting. I went to in Paris, they did a press conference to announce Vogue World Paris, even though everybody obviously knew that was happening, but like announce what it was more of what it was going to be. It's it's going to it sounds like it's going to be incredible. But it was amazing about this. It was that I think it was at the Crayon or maybe it was at the Ritz. It was at the Ritz. I don't remember. Fact check me later, people. It was in this beautiful room and what was amazing about it was that like every single big designer was there, every single big CEO, this the city of Paris. The fact that she has been able to coordinate and I know it hasn't been easy for them and there's all this red tape and bureaucracy and all of that. But the fact that she got all these people in this room at five p.m. on a Monday night, it I was she. Everyone talks about her being an ambassador. She should run for office again. I mean, it's just like this is a person who her talent is getting all those people in this room and then then doing something amazing. It's not just like I'm going to I can connect everyone. It the end result ends up being something incredible. And I feel like the Met more than anything is representative of her ability to turn something that is kind of standard fair in into something that everybody wants to be a part of, even like an eight year old kid knows about. That's what I'm saying. She's a visionary. She really is. It's like her capacity to do that and just to see the potential in that event. The way she did is incredible. And I mean, anybody in the fashion world, I mean, yes, to get everybody there on a Monday, but like, I think anybody who's in the fashion world doesn't say no to Anna. No, no. And it's especially right now, I think that in some ways they're relying on her more than ever, which is also is also interesting. So so what was your what was the reaction? What was your experience after first Monday and May debuted and and compared to your previous work? Like what was different about this? Somebody actually saw it. It was different. You know? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that it's probably one of the most seen documentaries ever. Oh, yes. Yes. I mean, and it's just been incredible. I mean, I think what's been most fulfilling for me is just like the impact it's had. And when I when I mean, besides the fact that it is somewhat of an education, but it's not nobody's force feeding anybody spinach, which I think is so important. I got letters from kids saying like I never knew what a curator was and now I want to be one. By the way, like Andrew Rossi, the director, who I have to shout out here because he's a genius. And when you know, when I was trying to find a director, I really very consciously picked somebody who knew nothing about the fashion world because I was afraid that it would get too like inside baseball or in like too much. And I really wanted a perspective from the outside. I think he did such a beautiful job. It's I think I agree. That's very important to have the because the the challenge with the fashion industry as someone who's been reporting on it for a long time is people are quite intimidated by it in a way that they aren't by other art forms. Right. I guess the art world too. But our world is so insular that that's like a whole other. You can't really compare them and you you know that better than me. But it's this thing of how do I show how important this industry is and in a fun and entertaining way to people who maybe don't get up every day and think, oh, I need to know what's going on with the new Chanel designer. Exactly. And you and you want to because, you know, culture for me, like the goal of everything I do is cultural expansion because I think that culture is the cornerstone of civility and the more you know and the more you understand others, the better you can get along the matter. You can like, you know, you can consider somebody else's point of view, even if it isn't your own. Yeah. So so expanding culture is the is why I tell stories. So why did you want to tell the story of Diane von Furstenberg? Because the thing I will say, she is a pretty open human being. Like if I text her or I even email her and say, I am writing a story and I would love your input, she calls you a meat. She calls immediately. She's such an open and she's just been so I feel like she's told her story many times she's she's obviously written a book. What did you want to say and what do you feel like the film said that she hadn't said before? Yeah, that was the question that everybody asked me when I was trying to convince her to make it, like, you know, she's an open book, like she's and and, you know, I've known Dbf, you know, back to my like sort of background. Her first husband, Aegon and my father were roommates in high school. So I've known her. Yeah. In boarding school in Switzerland. And so I've known her and he was my dad's best friend and I knew him and what a wonderful man. So I've known her like the greater part of my life. And she was a really big source of inspiration for me because I watched her. I watched her at a time truly go against the grain. Like at a time where women, especially in the circles that I was privy to, were not doing what she was doing. We're not receiving her, you know, entirely with open arms or perhaps looking at her in a particularly fond light or any of that, you know, she was just forging her own path and she was doing it in a way that was so refreshing and and, you know, I really believe you have to see it to be it. And she was very much my see it to be it. It was like just be unapologetic and just do you. And and and that's why I wanted to make. She gave me such a boost of of confidence in myself that I wanted to share that confidence with other women and girls. She is very good at making other people feel feel good. Yeah, she is. She really is. But but I think I just watched her operate and I watched her reinvent herself and I watched her, you know, get through adversity. And I think that what her mother Lily did for her, you know, having come out of a concentration camp, I mean, you know, her mother Lily wanted her to be prepared for anything in case something bad, bad ever happened to her. So she certainly prepared her for the world because, you know, that's that's really where where it comes from. She talked a bit about what you ended up uncovering and what the what the big takeaway is from from the film. Oh, well, you know, back to like touching upon, you know, it's a fashion doc, right? It's a fashion doc. But, you know, we touch upon so many important, you know, you've got human rights, you've got female empowerment, you've got women's rights. You even have, you know, this this interfaith collaboration between a Muslim and a Jew, right? Because our director, our lead director, Charmine and her co-director Trish, but Charmine is Muslim from Pakistan. And of course, as you know, DVF is the child of a Holocaust survivor. And so just by virtue of adding an interfaith collaboration, working towards a common goal into our global narrative, we've contributed something positive in the world. I mean, especially today. Besides that, you know, you have like women's rights. I mean, she was building a business at a time where a woman had to, you know, couldn't open a bank account without co-signing from her husband or her father and absurd, you know, what she's done. What do you think? Like, do you who do you think the audience for this one is versus some of the other work you've done, the broader or the more niche? I mean, my hope is that the audience for this is really. I mean, it's, you know, at the premiere, there was a thousand people in the theater and which was huge and amazing. I know. And so many friends of mine called me afterwards and said, I relate to this, I relate to that. My father just passed away. I relate to Alex. My, you know, I grew up this way and I relate to DVF, like never giving anybody the satisfaction, you know, at one point, you know, she says, did you ever feel uncomfortable when men sort of pushed themselves on you or didn't, and she was like, I would never give anybody that satisfaction because she doesn't ever want to be a victim, you know, and she'll never be a victim. And so, you know, there are so many touch points there for anybody who's watching to relate to something. So I think it's really, but in particular for women and girls, you know, to really see it, to be it, to really feel inspired, to go out and forge their own path and be the person they want to be and be unapologetic about who they are. Yeah, it feels like that is what it's easy to see her on stage at a conference or something or at a book signing and see her as someone who kind of represents female empowerment. But but I think what you were able to do and what she does when you meet her is she is actually just like we were talking about she makes you feel good. It's it's real. It's not like a stage presence or a stage persona. It's who she is. And that is the core of why she was she's been so successful. A hundred percent. And like one of the things that I want to add that was also such a big source of inspiration for me is that she also broke this barrier for me in my mind of these societal sort of norms for women. You're either a good mother or you're a business woman. You're either an intellectual or you're a seductress. You're either, you know, whatever it is, you know, you're a socialite or you're an activist. God forbid you be both because you can't. And like, no, like she navigates that effortlessly, beautifully. And she allows us as women to expand into the breadth of what we're capable of. And I could totally see how you were inspired by her as a young person because you've done so many different things and not let anyone put you in a box of tan and blonde or goth or totally. I mean, and it's just the beauty of life. Like one of the other things that she says on her life. And I think about that a lot because life is for living. And you know, you've got to live it because you're only here for a little while. So, you know, all those times I'm like, oh, I don't want to go. I don't like how I look or I don't like whatever stupid like voice you have in your head. Just put it aside and do it. Do the thing. Unless you're exhausted and you need self care, do the thing. Do the thing. Do the thing. I love this. So speaking of doing the thing, what are you going to do next? I guess this is this is an over yet. You have like another you have probably have another six months of dealing. Yeah, yeah, we have a premiere in Washington. We have a premiere. We're doing something for the CFDA. We have a premiere in London, Brussels, Paris. So it's going to be it's a it's a lot, but it's really fun. Amazing. And do you have a project that you want to do next? I do, but I, you know, I'm trying. I don't want to jinx it. Is it in the fashion world at all? It is, I think, you know, yes, I think from here on out. I mean, I never say never. Who knows? I may have another phase. We'll see. By the way, I wanted to give you my nickname for people who have been going to the Met Forever. I like to call them Met Vets. Met Vets, that's very cute. I'm going to start using that in line. I'm like, oh, she's a Met Vet. So good. Do you have a do you have a dream of who might be the new Chanel designer? Oh, God, I don't even want to step in that one. I don't even want to put my foot in there. But like, you know, it's yeah, it's it's definitely interesting. It's probably better because by the time this airs in a week or what have you. Ricardo Tishi. You know what? After remembering those couture collections, I'm into that. I would support that. I think he's one of the most talented couturiers out there, to be honest. Fabula, this was fabulous. Do people always like do play on word and say fabulous, fabula and annoying things like that? Listen, it's better than when I got what I when I was a kid. So what did you get when you were a kid? I don't want to I don't want to I don't want to put it out into the universe. I'll tell you when we're done. OK, definitely not fabulous. Well, you are and thank you so much for joining me. This was so fun and congrats on the film. I'm sure it's going to be super successful. Who doesn't love DBF and they're going to love her even more after this. So thank you so much for your time and for also sharing all your wardrobe information. Yeah, it's my pleasure. And I just want to say because I have to really shout out my my team on the film, you know, like it's like a recipe. You can't make a good recipe without every ingredient. And obviously the two directors, Charmene and Trish and my co-producer, Tracy and Sean. So all of them and Hulu, I mean, we made it all work and it really I'm proud of this than anything else at the moment. So now my friend, Spencer, works at Hulu. It's going to get you some awards. Let's hope so. He will listen to this. So he's going to be very embarrassed. Let's hope so. Spencer, counting on you. We're counting on you, Spencer. Avila, thank you so much. This is great.
