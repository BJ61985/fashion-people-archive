Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Puck's fashion and beauty memo line sheet. And today with me on the show we have none other than Emily Oberg. She's sporty, she's rich, and she has opinions about the US Open. Chendelle's creative director conundrum and so much more. Let's get started. Hey everyone, I am recording this ahead of time, so I'm going to keep this short. But I hope you had a great break, especially if you were in the US and you're on Monday off. Be sure to check out line sheet this week, which is dropping Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday instead of Monday, Wednesday and Thursday because of the holiday. I've got plenty of scoop. Rachel has plenty of scoop. I am flying to New York Tuesday morning. I may be flying as you're listening to this and I'm going to get going really fast on Wednesday, starting with Proenza Scholar in the morning. And then there are like 15,000 dinner events that night. Zanya, Harper's Bazaar, Louisa Vieiroma, this new tennis brand Spence. Just lots of stuff going on. Bejakamusa Nordstrom, Sakaya at Bergdorf Goodman. I'm going to try to hit it all up. Let's see what happens. And I have Ralph Lauren on Thursday, I lie on Friday. Again, on Friday there are about 5,000 million things. I'm going to go as much as I can. I'm excited. So, if you want to keep up with me during this week, we're actually at Puck launching a line sheet SMS feed. So, if you are a subscriber to line sheet, you can sign up for this SMS and every morning I'm going to send a note during Fashion Week. I'm going to send a note being like, this is what I'm going to. This is what I'll be doing this week. And I plan on just kind of sending short notes throughout the week. And the nice thing about it is I can text back and forth with you all. Obviously, many of you have my number, so feel free to keep using that. But if you're a line sheet subscriber, it's just a little additive thing. Since I'm not publishing every single day, you'll be able to just get a little extra intel from the events I'm going to, all that stuff. And we'll see how it goes. If it's super successful and people love it, maybe I'll do it all the time. But during Fashion Week, there's definitely so much going on that this is just a little extra for those of you who subscribe to Puck, which all of you should, as you know. It's really not that expensive. And actually, it's not expensive at all. And just do it. If you like this, you'll love that. Learn more about that to go to Puck.News or email me on Lauren at Puck.News. And I can get you sorted. But again, do have to be a subscriber. Let's get going on our conversation with Emily. Again, we recorded a little bit previous to this. So if anything crazy happened in the last five days and I didn't get to it, I apologize in advance. But otherwise, I think you'll enjoy this conversation. She's, I've known Emily for a long time. She's a really interesting person, great merchandiser, great creative director. And she has a lot to say. So let's get started. Emily Ober, welcome to Fashion People. I'm so happy. Thank you, Robin. You know, usually someone like you, I would have on a Friday show and we would ask what you had for breakfast. We don't usually do that on the Tuesday show. But I want to know what you had for breakfast. I didn't mean either. Yeah, it's too early. It's too early. We can follow Emily's wellness tips for for how to to manage your day to day food intake. I mean, I'm not only kind of fasting, but I usually have like in the morning, I'll have bone broth or like berries, but I'll have like a really big lunch always. Yes, same. So today in the news, the fun thing about this, we're recording this a little early. So if the world goes to shit by Tuesday, sorry, everyone, I'll do like a little addition up top. But we're recording this on Friday and it's it's a great week to have you on because you were actually in the news this week. Was I a little bit? But let's talk about first, let's talk US Open. Yeah, I have a lot to say about that. So so you are you going to the US Open? What let's start with that. Are you going? Do you normally go? How often are you going to like big tennis competitions? All that stuff? Because I know you're a big tennis person. I mean, I try to go to the French Open just because I'm in Paris, so it's easy. And then I do try to go to the US Open. Tickets are so hard to get always. So I really try. I'll be in New York to the semifinal final, which are the hardest to get. But I'm dying to go. So I'm trying to like make that if I get tickets, I'm just going to buy them. But they're like crazy expensive. So I'd rather if any brands of a swing sponsor. Yeah, someone invite Emily. What are you people doing? I think it's crazy. You have you have to be there. When when are they? It's the seventh and the eighth of the children. OK, so so they have time in the next. Yeah, in the next four to five days, people get get three to five days. Get on this and and invite Emily to those are the best matches to watch. So I really want to go. So what do you think of the general uniforms people wear? Like the way people dress on the court these days versus the way they were dressing like five or ten years ago, do you think it's better or worse? Um, I wouldn't even say it was like that different five or ten years ago. I feel like there's a big difference from like the seventies, eighties to now. I don't like we're wearing because I feel like it's very like techie in a kind of cheesy way. I don't know. There's always like some weird patterns or like weird color walk-ups. It's not the it's not the most stylish, I would say it's probably like performs well. And I think that's probably the goal, but I don't know why brands tend to go. Which is what I try to do. Yeah. So let's talk a bit about sporty and rich, which I actually own quite a bit of it. I have a lot of the active wear. I have one of the swimsuits, which is so good. I have, I also have, oh, and then I also have a merch shirt that says sports that I also bought for our sports column this John Iran, which he is now the coolest dad in, in Delaware. I think that's where you know, he lives in Maryland, Maryland, coolest dad in Maryland. But with, with the tennis gear in particular, because you have so many skews now, do you know how many skews you have on the site? Could you even account for how many there are? Well, we kind of changed the way we do drops. Like we used to just open the site for five days at a time when we have a launch, but now we leave it open all the time. So we usually keep like four drops on the website. And each drop is like around 25 to 30 skews. Okay. So that's like, that's, that's not great. So you have like a hundred to 125 skews on the site at a time. Yeah, usually I try to talk too much more. It feels like a real world though. You always have a little bit of everything. Yeah, we've expanded the product range quite a bit, which I think we was necessary. I mean, like crew next to trainees are still our best sellers, but I think as a brand, it's important to evolve. Yeah. So, and also you, everyone subscribed to Emily's sub stack. She just did an amazing piece about how she truly, who was I met with, oh, I have lunch with someone the other day, an investor who was like, that is a person who will win no matter what. Well, and there's a lot of negative, I feel like there's a lot of negative connotation around the word hustle these days for some reason, but you are like a pure in the most positive way. You have the hustle and you did a great piece about how you have built your business without all the crap that most people have, like rich parents, etc. But when you were building out the tennis, like you play tennis quite a bit, right? Yeah. So when you were building out like the tennis kit and starting to sell that type of product, like what did you feel like the market was missing and what have you had a lot of success with? I mean, I obviously love like vintage style, especially vintage tennis style. I'm mostly always looking to like vintage clothes for all of our reference pieces. Like rarely is it from new brands or current design. So I don't know. I was just looking at a lot of like old LaCoste, LSE, and Sheila, Adidas and just like old, cute tennis clothes because the stuff they make for women now is again, it's like very technical and like it's sportier, but I don't think anyone's considering like cheekiness or like a little bit of like elevated luxury. So yeah, I just really wanted to kind of bring back these like old tennis styles, but obviously update the fabrics and kind of update the fits because I feel like girls just want to wear like something like cute and small of the court and obviously flattering and but obviously some of that first one was one that you could sweat it and move in. Is tennis gear similar to just regular active wear where the women's stuff generally is cut in this way when you mentioned flattering? But I think a lot of active wear brands make quote unquote flattering clothes for women that have kind of curved seams and stuff that actually looks super lame and and isn't. It's not flattering and it also doesn't feel contemporary. Did is that a big issue in the in the tennis market as well? From what I've seen, yes, I haven't tried every tennis brand out there, but I would say from like the bigger players and the more common popular athletic wear brands. Yeah, I would say it's they're just like there's always something missing for me. So that's when I always try to like refine and get right with the stuff that we look. I mean, I'm really just made stuff that I want. So I feel like if a lot of the times it's not there, yeah, I'm just I'm just trying to make stuff that I like wish was around for me to wear. Yeah. How has your merch like? How is your drop strategy changed in you mentioned now you have four at a time? What did it look like when you first started producing stuff on a regular basis to now where you have this giant business? I mean, we first started with probably 10 skews at a time and it was pre-order. So it was pretty small and then over time, like I would say over like a year, we had to like shift away from the pre-order model just because the time like it's kind of a nightmare. Honestly, if you can do it on a small scale, it's fine. But once you start hitting bigger qualities and then you have delays and customer like it's a customer service nightmare. It became one for us. I talked about that in Substack. But yeah, we so we started doing small buys and producing ahead of time. And then for a while up until like maybe five months ago only, we were just doing like five days, the website was open and that's where we could get that drop. And then we would close the site and that kind of like how Supreme does it because I think they're obviously the blueprint their business model and how they've done things. I think in streetwear, you need that sense of like urgency and tidaliness. And I think if something's available all the time, it kind of automatically loses its appeal. But I think, you know, if we're only opens five days out of the month, we're obviously missing out on a lot of sales. So I just mean that that was just like a business decision that I made my team push back on it a lot because, you know, for like five years also we were doing things the other way. But I just think as a business, like we need to be selling more than five days a month. Yeah, I mean, especially because the stuff you're selling can be bought, like people can buy a lot of things. It's not like people are buying one item from you. I bet there are people who buy three, four, 10 things from you a month in some cases. Yeah. And then like moms who would always be like, how do we buy stuff from your site? Like it's closed, like it just like it didn't make sense. So now it's better. Yeah.

So the thing that I, that you were in the news for this week that you, you might not have noticed because you seem like the kind of person who doesn't pay attention to, to what other people are up to. But you, your Wall Street, so you do these theme drops and your Wall Street drop that dropped this week was in Emily Sumberg's newsletter. Have you and Emily Sumberg ever met? No, but I saw it and I posted an Instagram story in response for the list. Amazing. It was subtle, but it was there. I've not met her, but people always send me her stuff. And I think she's like a credible writer in fashion. I don't really know anything about her. So here's the thing. She basically was like, I don't get what she's great. She has this newsletter that is just, it's kind of general interest business stuff. And she writes about the thing I like about it is that like, where else are you going to hear about the major food groups, business opportunities? Like she writes a lot about like restaurants and smaller businesses that bigger publications can't really dedicate someone to. So she's, it's super fun. She's very, very, she really has an edge and she goes there and she basically was, and she's very honest. Like when, when the Bear and J Crew collaboration came out with, which our friend Chris Black was involved with, she was like, I think this collaboration sucks. And she, she definitely knows Chris. I'm not going to say anything about the collaboration. I think it's good that Chris did it. I didn't see it. So I don't know. Let's just say no comment. Love you, Chris. And it's very cool that you got that done. If he did, I honestly have not talked to him about it really. I did mention it in the thing in my newsletter. But, but anyway, she's real honest. And she was like, I don't understand why this is Wall Street and that she got all these people to make comments. I saw her. But the thing, the hilarious thing is, first of all, you and her would love each other. Maybe there would be budding heads. I feel like you, you would like be really good friends, which is interesting. But B, when that kind of stuff happens, because I do think you, like the first, well, the first question is what were you trying to get across? I was not offended by the Wall Street thing. I thought it was cool. And I thought, I mean, I don't think it looks like stuff that people are wearing on Wall Street. But I really like the fact that you, I don't know if that was all your own accessories, but you use like other brands' accessories to sort of style it. I thought that looked good. But what was the point of the Wall Street like concept? I mean, we beam all of our collections, I think them. And for me, it's like part of this world of supporting rich is like Wall Street and this kind of culture. And the original Wall Street Money Never Sleeps was my mood board for that. And, you know, it's like, it's not so literal. Like, I think it's like, I think sometimes people forget fashion is meant to be fun. And for me, it's like, I'm not a serious person at all. Like, I'm rarely serious. And even though I take the job seriously, it's just fun. And it's like, okay, Wall Street, like, like our next one is like a question. And then the other ones like countryside, it's just like, these themes that fit within the brand and our world. Do I think that people at Wall Street are going to wear these clothes? I don't know. And I don't care. Like, our audience is going to wear these clothes. And that's in it. Like, it's like, I know, it's not so serious to me. I don't know. It's not so literal. Yeah, I would say that you are not exactly what you said. Like, you are not self serious. I think you're a serious person, but you're not self serious. Like, you take everything you do seriously, and you want to win and you want to do well, and you you're a mindful human being, but you're not like, you like are in on the joke or whatever. So that is the next question. How like, when this kind of stuff happens, because you get targeted a lot, like for many reasons, one is that you're proud of what you've accomplished, which you should be. Two is that you're a cute girl. And three is that you have sort of done this your own way and not succumb to all the like, things that most of these brands succumb to. But like, when you do get pushback from people, and I wonder if this like helps sell it because she has an amazing audience. And I bet you got like a lot of people buying via her her site. But like, how how do you when this kind of stuff happens? Like, what what is your attitude about it? Well, I only see stuff when people send it to me. So my friends send that one to me. But my attitude is just like, I'm annoyed. And I feel like I'm an easy target. But I also feel like it's a bit unfair. And just they people in general are too serious. I think it's an American, I find Americans take themselves really seriously. And I find that like, as a Canadian, and like, part of the Commonwealth, I really think that there's culturally, there's a big difference. Like, I feel like I don't with like British people are not sharing people so well, because there's just that sense of like, jokingness kind of in everything that we do say that Americans don't really have. Yeah. And sometimes that's just like, like, you either get what I do or you don't and it's fine if you don't. But I like if you don't, then just move on. Why do you need to like, be so upset about it? Yeah. Yeah, I think there I see I see what you mean by that. The thing I like about Americans is that they're so fake, usually, that like, it's just easy to deal with them. Yeah. Whereas I prefer, I don't deal with British people as much as I used to. I have lots of Canadian friends, I would agree with that. I probably the best situation. British people can be kind of passive aggressive and that annoys me. Whereas Americans are just full full on fake. But French people, honestly, they're the toughest to deal with initially, but the best in the long term. Because they're like very mean at first. But then once you're in, you're in and it's real. And it's not like, and they can, they'll be like, I'm mad at you. And then that they're like, but it's okay, we're still friends. It's much more straightforward. So you spend a lot of time there too, right? So yeah, you probably know exactly how to deal with them. My both of you is French. I mean, I will say they're quite moody. But yeah, it's like, at least they're honest about it. And like aren't trying to be like fake nice. And like, I will get over it. And then like everything's fine. Totally. So I wanted to also talk to you about something I thought you'd have a really interesting take on this. I have a piece in Tuesday's line sheet coming out. I guess that this will actually come out before line sheet. We usually it comes out after boat. We're running line sheet on Tuesday instead of Monday, but everyone will know about it anyway, because they're launching on their Instagram. But Christina O'Neill's Sotheby's magazine that she when she left WSJ, or she got fired from WSJ, which she fully uses that word, she's not afraid of it. She was hired almost very, it took a few months, but like, pretty quickly at Sotheby's just kind of launched their editorial and launch magazine there. And I have a piece with her that kind of walks me through how they put the magazine together. But we ended up talking a lot about consumer culture, essentially, and where it's going and collectors. And I've talked about this with our mutual friend, Jesse Lee, but it about like fashion versus watches versus art versus cars versus homes versus furniture and where that's all going. And something that Christina, I think she's trying to do in this magazine is fashion is just one element of this bigger pursuit of beauty or beautiful things. And she's going to interview people about like the cool stuff that they own. But as someone who you feel like a real enthusiast about the stuff you own and passionate about it, it's not your whole life. But like, it seems like you have fun collecting. Like, what do you think as someone who sells something that people buy, how consumer culture has changed in the last few years moving from that sort of more straightforward, I just want to get like a bunch of designer bags to now I actually want this like very specific chair or whatever. Yeah, I mean, I definitely think people just the natural progression of like growing up and getting older, I think the things that you value choose. So I think well clothes and accessories or something will always need yeah, I think bigger things like cars and homes and furniture are now things that people my age are investing in. But I like I think clothes will always be in necessity and it'll always be something that you need and want. By the way, the fact that she called me a fast fashion rather than very offended by it because I don't think I'm the same as an H&M which is Emily, that is not a good way to say it. Sporty and rich is not fast fashion. I will tell you that. But anyway, but back to what you were saying. I actually probably said that because we release so often maybe. And our price point isn't like absurdly high, but it's also not super low. So I think that's like technicalities. But I think our consumer like I've definitely seen a shift in their wanting just kind of more elevated ball made pieces. So it's like our denim did really, really well, like our outer wear and earn it's are starting to do really well. And I think people don't like invest in those pieces that they can wear over time with some longevity. So I don't know. I think people spending habits are changing. Obviously, I think like the recession is kind of starting to finally affect brands and especially the luxury market, which I wouldn't really consider as part of that market. But yeah, I think the general people just want to kind of curate their life. And so that goes into products like homes and things for your home and these things that I think people aren't so concerned about five or 10 years ago. Yeah, I mean, you started your career at Complex in some ways. Do you think that that's sort of we were talking about the supreme, I always think about like, when I started the shop even two years ago, it was still felt like the culture youth culture was sort of centered around standing in line waiting for these drops. And it there is, you're the point of like people getting older, but you and I are probably 10 years apart. I'm probably 10 years older than you and we're still of that same generation in some ways. But do you feel like that sort of culture around the consumption of clothing has shifted and maybe dissipated a little bit where that's not the only way people are socializing like going to wait and line it off white or waiting for the supreme drop or the Stussy by Nike drop or whatever? Yeah, I mean, I think that was like a moment in time of in true work culture, but it's definitely died down. I think one those people have grown up and the new generation is just like waiting in lines is not that thing. And I think like supreme is more accessible now, especially after they sold. Same with like sneakers, like there's so many resale and aftermarket apps that I just feel the only way to get things now is not just stand in line. And before that was the case. So I think that's also dictated in people's habits. It's just like how how browners are selling and making their products accessible. Yeah, cool. You ever hit that moment when your kid asks for help with homework and you're like, wait, when did long division get this complicated?

So I had a piece last week about the Chanel recruitment, creative director recruitment process and how it's going. And I had some very high level sourcing on it, essentially saying that there are still a bunch of people in the mix. And honestly, like these interview processes at these big brands could take months, years, they might get really, really far with someone and then it just doesn't happen at the last minute. But that Simon Port Jack-A-Mousse is interviewing next week with Alon Wertheimer, who is the owner of Chanel. And has already gone through, has a team of eight people working on the project, has already met with Bruno, has Bruno Pavlowski, who is the president of fashion, Lena Nair, who's the CEO of the whole company. And now is meeting with Alon in London next week. Chanel and Jack-A-Mousse reps for like, we wish not to comment or that sort of thing. That doesn't mean he's going to get the job. But I'm curious to know from you, because you're a consumer of Chanel. You are a creative director. You are a brand person. You've built this brand that resonates globally that people buy without even thinking you were talking about the denim. I was like, Oh, I actually own two pairs of her jeans. It's great. I think that I'm like only a light adabler in Sporty and Rich. And then I realized I actually have a lot of it. But what do you think about Chanel? Like, who do you think would be a good creative director? What do you think they should do? And what does that brand need? I like Chanel. I would say it's one of my favorite brands, but more so the stuff that they used to do. I think that they've really lost their way. And some of the stuff they make is just like so mind boggling to me and confusing and not something that I would ever wear. And I, you know, they have like such a vast consumers. I'm sure it works for some people, but I just think it could be the best. Like it's one of the best brands in the world. But every time I go in there, I see something and I'm just like, something is always off and nothing is ever like, this is great. This is great. I want it like this is perfect. I want this. It's a bit odd and just the color like it's so like pink and purple and like, it's just a lot. And I don't think that's how like a lot of women like us want to dress. Yeah. And Rue Landrather, right? That's Sophia Coppola was going to do it. I mean, that wasn't a rumor. It was just that Steph Yacca and I decided it was a, well, Steph Yacca decided it was a good idea and I pushed it more and more and more, but we would love it to happen. I, you know, she does work for Chanel. I loved her stuff for Louis Vuitton. And I think like she's just always been one of like the best dressed women, like the best style sensibilities. Jacques Mouss, I think, I mean, I don't personally like the line, but I really respect what he's built. And I don't think he really like investors at the beginning. I think he really did a lot of it on his own from what I know. Yeah. I think he's built something totally genius. I think he's great. He, there's definitely a market obviously for what he's done. I think his sales are like pretty insane and the numbers they do are very impressive. I think he could probably make it cool again. I could see it. Yeah. I was pretty, when this first bubbled up, there was someone saw him in the office, I guess, and it, he was in the office hanging out or something and it became a thing. And I kind of dismissed it and was like, and someone else said, oh, he's friends with someone who works there. He goes there all the time. It just felt like, it felt like rumor mongering and a, at a level that I prefer to stay out of. But then when this, when this came up from like people in the know, the thing that we have to remember about Chanel is from everything I've, I've heard from people who work at the company, the commercial product was selling well. The, if you look, I was, I had dinner with a friend last night who has these, had these adorable white Mary Janes. They were so good. I would totally buy them. Like the shoes are still good. I agree. They went like way too heavy on the pink and purple, which is, those are colors you buy like one item, not 15, but this is a machine. They, they know what they're doing, but what they need is something at the top that gets people excited. And I think that the accessories they were doing were really good and they were being sort of, you don't think of it, you're not interested in it because of the fact that like the runway looks so sour. And, and so, and then the other part of it is, so the runway was an issue, but then the prices are so crazy. And it's like, well, I should, if I'm going to get a jacket, I might as well just get a vintage one because it's going to be expensive, but at least it feels more timeless and it's not 10 grand or whatever. Like I can buy one for 1500 or two, you know, which is still expensive, but et cetera. So it just feels like he actually, he's a great merchandiser. He's great at creating an amazing runway show. And he also, you know, there, those bags, I agree. What I ever wear one of those bags, no, but you know what I do have from him is I had a dress from a very early collection that was adorable. It was like a window pane check drop waste dress that I did end up selling at some point because the fit wasn't great, but it was very early. It was like a young designer and the fit was off. And then I have this beautiful yellow dress from the collection that he did. I think it was La Bamba. It was really the collection where the brand popped off and this dress is gorgeous. And I still wear it. And I have a, I actually know two other people who own it and one of them, I wear it to weddings or whatever. And it fits well. And it was like, I think $700 or $900. It's a beautifully constructed, like I can wear it for formal weddings. So I think, I think he, the team is in place that he actually, he might be, and he's, who else of that group, that peer group, do people know their name? Like of people who have friend, who are French, who have designer brands, like you are actually in this group as well. Like people know who you are, but you have a different, you have like, you're an entrepreneur and a creative director and a person online or whatever. I don't, influencer is not the right word for you, but you are a person of influence or whatever. He's a little different than that. But of that generation of like traditional designers, who else does anyone know? Whereas his face and name are, so he might actually be a good person for it. I just hope they pick someone who is making stuff that people are excited about. I don't really care if it's one of my people or not, but if it's like a boring person, I'm going to be, who stuff is not exciting outside of this, either totally unknown, who's going to wow us or someone who, who feels like they can bring a new energy to it. I'm pro it at this point. I would still love Sophia Coppola. I would still love Eddie Salman. Like I think he is the one, but that doesn't seem like it's going to happen. So yeah, I think he would do a good job. I think the thing with Chanel is it being probably one of the best brand in the world. They can make anything and put their logo on it and it will sell. Yeah. Like Supreet. And, but I think after a while and to kind of like capture the younger audience, yeah, there needs to be some excitement. Like I remember back in the day when they did like a Reebok club and that was like very cool and exciting and they just need to get back to stuff like that. Yeah. And like they could just make everything. I would, it would be like a dream to make Chanel stuff because the logo is perfect. They have such a strong brand. The capabilities are endless, but I don't, she would do a good job. I think she would be good for it. Yeah. I nominate Emily Oberg. And I'm thinking whatever will like work for a fashion company. This is the one issue is that, look, you know, this business is not easy. And I think he had a tremendous amount of growth for a long time and maybe in the last year or so there have been some, I don't know with growth if there have been any challenges, but I think he had a CEO change. I did a story on this about, I don't know, six months ago or something. Yeah, it's called out. And so I think like it would be helpful for him to have the support of this company to, because he could definitely do both. I don't think, like Carl Lagerfeld was a freak, like he did seven brands at once and no one can, no one else could do that. But I think he could do both of his brand and Chanel at once given the support. And if they can also, you know, make, I don't know if they ever invested in Carl, if the worth, I was ever investing Carl Lagerfeld's own brand. He always had, he was always changing investors with that. But if they could help stabilize the Chacomus brand and build it up as well, I think it, yeah, I think it could work. I mean, we'll see again, like the sourcing I have on this is really good. But these people definitely were not like, this is the, this is it. Like this stuff, this stuff changes all the time. And I was thinking about it when I was writing the story the other day, I guess that was yesterday, I don't remember one, but the other day, these creative director appointments are just so fluid. Like you can have, I remember talking to a CEO of a big American brand at one point, they, they were looking to bring someone else new in and I gave a couple recommendations. And the person who they were looking to fire still works. This is probably seven years ago, still works at the company. So it just like, it doesn't really mean anything. It's very fluid. And if they can find the right person for the next phase, they will. But the thing like you said about Chanel is they could probably float without anything for two more years. I'm really 10, but like too comfortably and then get someone. So they're going to wait until they make the right decision. But I think it's exciting. I'm, if this is what happens, I won't be super angry about it. So we'll see. Yeah. That's like the only person that I would compare to Jack Moose's Virgil. Oh yeah. Because I feel like they're still in a way where they're so culturally relevant and people just love them. And then, you know, Virgil did LV and he had his own brand. So I think he could, he could kind of have like a similar trajectory for sure. I don't think there's anyone who's like that right now. No. And also the fact that both of those companies, the Ateliers are in Paris will make it a lot easier. Like from what I know very little about Virgil, but was that he was like on a plane every single day. His family, I think maybe they lived in Paris part of the time, but they were also in Chicago. And, and then he was flying to Milan and then to Paris and then would, and it just, and I know a lot of these people who don't live in Paris, but work for Parisian brands do that. It just seems like really taxing. I mean, Jonathan Anderson is a great example of he does, I think, don't quote me on this people, but I think people have said he does like Mondays and Fridays in London and then three days a week in Paris or something like that. I don't know what he does now. This was probably five years ago, but he was splitting his time between the two. Wasn't that? No. Yeah, that's not bad. It's how what are we doing? What are we doing, Emily? What are you doing especially? Yeah, I think I need to like maybe open it off. It's here because I do want to be based here more. I like doing LA Paris like it's not sustainable. It's so hard. Especially if I like when I look family and like the next few years, like all of that, like there's nowhere. Yeah, mine is much less than yours, but it's still taxing on me. So I can't imagine a person who's actually living in both places, how they would manage it. But that is the thing once you have a kid. Like my kid has the best life. And also my life is nice here. I don't want to be stressed. I'm not stressed when I'm here. So anyway, that's an offline conversation. But final thing, do you have a pick to win the US Open? Well, I got Alperaz, but I guess that's not happening. No. I hope that was kind of shocking. I don't know. I'm trying to think who else I love. He's really just my favorite. He just seems so humble. He's so fun to watch. He seems just like a nice good person. Like he's not arrogant. Yeah, he obviously plays like crazy. But let's see. I think that too was a lot for the US Open. Well, hopefully you'll be there for the semifinals. Everyone, someone, someone take Emily. Jesus. It's crazy. It shouldn't be this hard. No. I'll just buy it. I don't know. No, it shouldn't be. Don't worry. We're going to make it happen for you. Yeah. Thank you for joining me. This was fun. Let's have you back on soon.
