I also touch on the situation with John Barbados and Under Armour, where he is, I believe, chief design officer. It's an interesting little pocket of our world. I share a CondiNest and Vanity Fair baby scoop, I'd say. And I also scratch the surface, I guess pun intended, on the battle between lab grown and natural diamonds.

James Scully, welcome to fashion people. Thank you for having me. Very excited to be here. So what did you have for breakfast this morning? It's so early. Yes, I didn't. I didn't eat. Oh, I guess I'll be eating breakfast after this. Now that I'm living country life and actually have chickens, pretty much every morning, it's going out into the yard and grabbing, grabbing some eggs and that. And they're just up here. There are just so many amazing bakeries and bread places. So it'll probably be a love of bread from Mel's Bakery and some, some eggs from the backyard. I think I knew that Mel's moved up there. I went there a few times when it was still in the city. But it's, or was it, is it, it's so good. It's the same place, right? Yeah, same place. And they're on their third James Beard nomination, which just brings even more people into town. But it's just the best bakery on the planet. And the amazing thing about them is you don't go there every day and are the same thing. So on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday is a different sandwich. It is a different bread. So if you love this particular bread, you have to go on Sunday. If you, and then they do you every day, they have like a surprise pastry and or sandwich and or, and then it's just every week. So you, you just go back every week because they have something new. And which town upstate are you in? I'm in Gallatin, which is 20 minutes away from Hudson. Oh, nice. Okay. And how long have you been living up there for? So I think this year is officially we're coming in on five. We started to rent up here during the pandemic. Funny, I mean, you know, talking about full circle moments back in the day, I used to work with J. Crew during the Frank and Jenna era and I did their castings and Frank had moved up here, he walked away and then moved up here and opened an inn. And he moved out of his house and he had asked us if we knew anyone that we've want to rent. And we were like, we'll do it. And so we came up here and sort of, you know, we've been up here on and off for years. And once we got up here, we were just like really kind of blown away by, you know, how many ex New Yorkers and creatives were up here that were actually doing amazing things like opening restaurants and galleries. And it just felt like this really interesting place with a lot of creators and makers. And we thought, oh, this is a really nice place to be. And then during COVID, my partner, I would had already retired in parentheses, but was going to figure out what was next. And my partner was working for Ralph Lauren and he was like, go during the pandemic and he came downstairs one day and was like, what if we never went back? And so I didn't believe, you know, it was the beginning of the pandemic craze. And we thought, well, we'll put our apartment on the market and we'll come back to our senses. It will never sell. And it was gone in two hours. And we also had a house in Fire Island and it was gone the next day. So we were like, we live here. And that was that was it. And then we just kind of adapted as as it went on. But well, you opened a store, which we're going to talk a lot about today. But so so many people did something similar. Do you ever miss the city? Do you ever think about like getting an apartment, just a renting or anything like that? I don't, which is really surprising for me to say because I was there for 40 years. I was probably hanging out there for four years before I moved there. Yeah, when I was in high school and it was always my dream to live there. I never would have thought I would left. New York changed a lot and it changed in a way that wasn't so interesting to me anymore. I mean, it just felt like I joke with people now. If you want to pair eyeglasses, some athletic wear, a salad and your bank. It's a great. It went from being an amazing city of opportunity to a city of convenience. And I didn't I didn't run away from home to have target and things like that followed me. It became very suburban. And, you know, I feel. When I'm in Brooklyn, when I'm in the Upper West Side, I still feel like these parts of New York exist. But just like I said, I was I moved to New York in 1982. So like I was in a hurry every night. I was like, you know, there was just it was a real cultural mecca at that point. And that doesn't exist. So I felt that a lot. Yeah, on my last trip and I go, I mean, I think I went eight times last year. We moved to LA during the pandemic and not not totally different. I mean, we we sort of were like, maybe we'll try. We didn't ever have plans of coming back. And then I got pregnant literally the month we moved here. And that we definitely were never coming back. But it's interesting. I I go back and forth on it. But though this last trip, I was there for over the met doing events and things. And stayed downtown. And first of all, it felt very young. But it felt like Murray Hill Young. Yeah, yeah. And I don't know if you if you just read the cover article of New York Magazine about this. Oh, yes. And I just think the and that's like everyone in New York at this point, even the other young. It makes me sad that you now have a generation of people that are moving to one of the greatest cities in the world to recreate a life of a television show that was never even a realistic portrait of New York. And it just makes me really like this is all like you're not moving here to be an artist, you're not moving here to be a banker, you're not moving here to be in fashion, you're moving here because for four years, you're going to pretend you're Sarah Jessica Parker, which really just. Also, they don't care about clothes. No, I'm wearing white t-shirts and jeans, which is one of the reasons opened a store up here because when we moved up here, you know, you know, so there's it's major restaurants seen up here. And one of the things is a lot of really great restaurateurs like Tavo Somer and all of these people, you know, they started opening restaurants up here and their people live very quietly up here. But everyone dresses and not necessarily. It's a very sporty place. But, you know, I go to the farmers market and I'm like, wow, there are really incredible con guys here and their kids are cool and their wives are cool and like they're not buying their clothes in New York and they really they're stylish and it's all a very there's definitely a Hudson Valley look. And I just thought, wow, like even New Yorkers don't dress like this anymore. It's the same thing when I go back, everyone is just carrying, you know, is wearing that dumb vest and a pair of Lululemon pants and a cup of coffee. And and like I said, they you know, they just care about a designer starter bag and a cheap coat and it's like, I miss, you know, that, you know, the real New York, you know, you still see them on the Upper East Side. You still see, you know, you still have the Upper West Side woman, but the young New Yorker, which is the person who really should be setting the tone, is just kind of like a car, you know, it's it's unfortunately they've all been ticked off, you know, and that's. Yeah, they must be in Bushwick because that's the only thing that I or or further. Further now. But yeah, I felt that I was on the Upper East Side a bunch for different events and seeing friends and I have so many friends who have moved up there now or or Upper West Side or I mean, that's I it's funny. You said the thing about you didn't move to New York to live in the suburbs. I feel that way also. And is that's a huge reason we moved to LA, which which is one big suburb. But I was like, well, but an authentic suburb. Yeah. Well, it's funny. Last night I went to this really fun Tory Burch event. They had a store opening, which like no one in New York. I would never go to a store opening in New York. That's not completely true, but mostly true. If I went, I would go for five minutes. This was like the event of the night was everyone went to the store opening and Sierra did there was a DJ and Sierra got up and sang her song with the DJ. And there were all these people and lots of famous people at the store opening. I was texting and I was like, I can't believe we all just went for and it was a big party. It was like the event of LA of the evening. And then they had a really fun dinner at Mr. Chow's and that was fun. And I was walking back to my car because I don't do valet. I only I don't like it. It's I don't I don't like waiting. So I just I park in like I parked in a public and there was this. There's this weird area of Rodeo Drive that's like. It's like the road. They drive is already like Disneyland, but it's fake cobblestone streets. And it's up on it's up near Wilshire. And I was walking up to my car and there was this weird like. See love seat with flowers, fake flowers all over it. So you Instagram and in in lights, it said rodeo drive. And I thought like, oh, why do I live here? And I got really depressed because I put it with the reality is like, that's everywhere now and you're right. And like to find something real, you do need to seek. You really need to do a lot of work and. And in New York, but what was New York like when you moved? First of all, where did you move from in 1982 and what was New York like when you moved there? I moved from New Jersey. So I was from town called Southamboy, which was a really working class town, which allegedly held the Guinness's Book of World Records for the smallest town in the world, but the most bars. So my God, I went out the second I was old enough. Yeah, it was super Irish Catholic. You know, everyone, you know, everyone worked in a factory. My father was a welder and my mother was a forklift operator. Like everyone was just like amazing. It was a tough, tough town. But literally when I was like seven or eight years old, my aunt took me to see a Broadway show, which was Pippin, which really goes to show you how long you go. It was like 73. Like that minute I was like, I'm moving here. Like that was I just knew. And when I was old enough, like when I was, you know, 14, 15, me and all my friends would just, you know, jump on the bus and like start learning the streets. And like everyone went to canal jeans and everyone went to, you know, there were just there were just incredible places to shop and to go. And even, you know, then you in my senior year of high school, I started hanging out with a friend who, you know, we would go to, they would do roller disco nights at the Roxy, where Africa Mobata would be DJing. And that was during this whole like punk, funk thing. So, you know, you'd have part on it in the B-52s and everybody roller skating. And it was kind of an all ages thing. And I just thought the minute I can like get out, I'm going to come here. And I thought I was going to be an actor. And when I was in high school, one of the places I shopped at all the time is Fierucci. And Joey Arias was probably one of the first people I met. And I remember telling him I had applied to Carnegie Mellon and I was waiting. And he's like, well, if you want to be an actor, like why would you? And I really loved fashion more, but it was just kind of a battle between what it was that I was going to do. And I was just afraid I wouldn't get into FIT or Parsons, which I did not. So then I was like, OK, I would be an actor. And he's like, if you're going to be an actor, he's like, then you have to live in the city. Don't be a pussy. And moves to the Midwest, like get into the city. So that's where I'm from. Let me tell you, you're not going to get a not going to make it an acting. We're going to Carnegie Mellon. Yes, I was waiting that for that in Oberlin. And I was just all of a sudden my neighbor said, you know, there's a school. And I was the worst student in high school. I graduated bottom of my class. I just was not, you know, like my brain was somewhere else. And the minute I started hanging out in New York, I just gave up on any of that. And my friend, Kim, was like, oh, well, I'm going to this college called Laboratory Eastern Merchandising. And every year they do an interview and they give one student a full scholarship just based on an interview. They don't care about your grades. They don't care about anything. She's like about 200 or 300 people apply for this. But like, why don't you try? So I went and thought, OK, regardless of moving to the city with no college, with no job and so I did the interview and then about two weeks later, like they call me there, like you got in. So I was like, oh, fantastic. So I now I have a school to go to. And I was able to move to New York because I was saving money for a Renault car that could be my first car, which was $3,000. And I had all the money saved to buy a car. So I was just like, I've got my driver's test and I'm like, I'm coming. Like, that's it. I just moved like. What job were you doing in high school that you saved all that money? I was, believe it or not, I was working at Benetton and Woodbridge Center, which was a mall near my house. And and I, you know, all through high school, I was working for local grocery stores. I just saved all my money because there was no, you know, I love to hunt. You know, there was I had no expenses and other than just going to the city and buying clothes, that was kind of that was my thing. So when, yeah, and then like I said, in my senior year in high school with my friend Ray area opened and that was just like, so, you know, and those big line, I don't know how in hundreds of people standing out so I'd trying to get in, they pointed it out and was like, come on in. And then I was then I was really like, I don't care. Like I'm just taking my money, getting an apartment and I'll figure it out. But I got I got into LAM and then I guess to again, in this whole first full circle, this of my career, the things that always mattered most to me were stores, fashion shows and magazines. And at some point, I wanted to work at one or all of those things. And I managed to do them all. And now they've kind of I've been able to use all of that to kind of move forward in this next this next phase of my life. But my first day and I was really on Swiss. I was a kid from Jersey. You know, the world was an international, you know, I just my neighbor had handed me a stack of like 40 years worth of vogue's and I was like, oh, my God, and now there's the New York Times. I didn't know there was such thing as a Paris Vogue or an Italian Vogue or, you know, anything like that. And I didn't really know what a fact I saw pictures of fashion shows. So I thought, you know, this would be interesting for me. And the first day of class, I got into school and there was an announcement on the bulletin board. There was just a piece of paper like fashion show, a Bergdorf Goodman show up at 10 o'clock, you know, and well, didn't say what it was or anything. So I thought, wow, I can't believe like I just got into the school and I'm going to cut class, but I'm going to cut class. And I went to Bergdorf Goodman. I went upstairs and it was Carl Lagerford's first collection for Chanel. So they bought the Hulk tour collection over to Bergdorf Goodman. And I literally walked backstage and, you know, there was Bonnie Berman and Inez and all these things, people that I saw, I was like, oh, my God, I can't believe like this is incredible. And so they did two shows. I dressed the shows and I literally was like, who like who's in charge here? Because I want to do more of these things. And someone said, oh, it's at the time it was a company called Christina Godgreen Loving, which was Donna Christina. And I can't remember. I'll remember her partner's name, but I just walked up to them and I was like, you know, I just went to school and like, can I freelance for you guys? I'll do anything. And they're like, yeah, in two weeks later, we're having Jean-Paul Gaultier is coming and doing a show on in the Cirque du Vais. He's bringing the whole Cirque du Vais show, which for me was just to see pictures of that was for me, one of the most seminal shows. That was the show for me. Like, he's the greatest designer. Like, narrow as two weeks later backstage with Gaultier. And then they did a Fendi show and then the Loquale show was like one year later, you know, and they produced a lot of shows in New York. So they did Calvin, they did. Gosh, I'm trying to think of all the shows that they worked on. They did Calvin, they did Perriella's they did. At the time, Adrian Vittadini was a big thing. Matsuda was a big thing. So I just managed to get production work, whether I was writing dressing cards or dressing people. And that was kind of I was like, all right, this is this is what I want to do. OK, so a couple of questions. One is when you said Inez, did you mean Inez de la? De la Versage, yeah. So she was she was Carl Lagerfeld's like collaborator, muse. She's amazing. But you're saying that a lot of these designers themselves would come. Was it common for the designers from Europe like Goatierre, who whomever to come to New York to do sort of second shows at that time? Because it wasn't as easy to distribute the imagery and all that stuff. Was that a common thing? Well, it all kind of coincided with Bert de Goodman, which at that time was considered a very stodgy store. And they had just kind of revamped it and literally the big new fashion news was sounds that Bert Dwarfs finally got escalators, which they had never had. And so Bert Dwarfs really were like, you wouldn't go with, you know, it was an old woman store as well. You know, and it was Lord and Taylor and B. Altman and these were all great old dames, but they were, you know, at the time, Sax was the department store in New York. I mean, it was really wherever that was the epicenter at that moment, because there were only like four of them in America. And every American designer had a boutique in there. And so Bert Dwarfs was now coming in to their own. And so they were bringing these shows over to tell people like, we are not your grandmother's Bert Dwarfs anymore. And that was that. And then they just really like that was the beginning of the next renaissance for Bert Dwarfs. But yeah, that was really that was quite a time. And wow, that's what was fashion week like here in the eighties? Fashion week in the eighties was it was cool because that's the other things. Like, again, I pulled out one of my old I used to like write all my calendars like by hand and I found these little books and I was looking at all my I wish I'd now packed up somewhere, but looking at all the show schedules. Like, New York was really packed like in the eighties, especially like 82, 83, you know, that was really kind of the zenith of Calvin and Ralph. And Donna Karen was still she was still an incline. So these, you know, these were sort of the big anchors of the week. And you had Bill Blass and Oscar de la Renta and Carolyn. You know, there was like that whole that whole world, which doesn't exist anymore of the Park Avenue woman. And, you know, so it was super diverse. But a lot of the people that God, Green loving took on, they took on a lot of younger people at the time. So I ended up like working with like Angel Estrada and David Cameron. And, you know, like these people who like were really like great for their moment. And but, you know, like every young designer, they kind of had their time. But no, it was really and was all over the place. Like, you know, like one day I would be backstage at Calvin and then the next day was Matsuda and then, you know, there were just all these sort of like, this is the show of the week to be in New York. But it was really busy and there was a lot like said, there really was a lot of attention on young, young New Yorkers at the time. And Andre Walker, like there were just all of these people that were, you know, they're still around, but they were really like the young guns. Yeah. What was store wise? Because I was just thinking about Shara Vari because of this potentially this Barney's television show. Store wise, what were the cool like designer stores? Was it Barney's and did you go to Shara Vari or were you like, what were where were people who were buying labels of the Japanese brands in Armani shopping at that time? At that time, well, the same thing when I was when I was in high school and I was handed this stack of Oaks, as I was looking through a bunch of ads, I had seen this ad for this store called Shara Vari, which they were the first to carry Yogi on the moto in America and a lot of the a lot of the Japanese. So I'd also set my sights when I got to New York, like I'm going to get a job there. And yeah. But so at that time, the stores, like I said, as far as a department store, Saks was really the shika store at the moment. But then as far as boutiques, you had Bendles, you had Shara Vari Barney's downtown because it didn't exist. Like Barney's had the the shikis part of Barney's was the Barney's penthouse, which is also where the best men's and women's collections and same thing when they started carrying the Japanese, you went to the penthouse to buy, you know. And like I said, they had, you know, Shara Vari was all edged, Barney's was really like Chloe and Azadine and and the Japanese. And then you had Diane B, which also and she was also in the other. No, Diane B was she was on West Broadway, which in the 80s, West Broadway was like the epicenter of cool. Like that is where you'd party all week, you go out all night and then Sunday. You would all have lunch at Yiltree, Marely, and then you would shop at Diane B. And then if was around the corner. So those were like the and then there was some there was a Carol Rolo on the Upper East Side. She was the one person who had like that level of designer merchandise and people. And people shop like because especially in area. People shopped to buy outfits to go out. So the whole club world was basically based on what you were buying. Being designer clothes weren't expensive then. They were, you know, they were money, but you, you know, it wasn't out of the realm to go to Bloomingdale's and put a go TA outfit on your credit card and then return it on Monday just so you could get entry. Oh man, so fun. Yeah. And then, yeah, so I applied for a job at Charlery like seven or eight times and didn't get it. And then they were opening a new sports store on the Upper East Side. I was like, well, I'll just lower my standards and stop going for 57 and workshop and I'll try the sports store. And I got, I got hired and sorry, super excited and I got bored of selling like really quick. I was there from 85 to 94. Oh wow. The, yeah. So I asked the window display director, I was like, you know, I really want to do windows, could I work with you? And he's like, sure. So they took me off the sales floor. I was working with him. So while we did the windows and all the six doors, he also merchandised the floors. So now one night he just said to me, he's like, I can't do the floor. Would you go in and redo the floor? Well, I do the windows. And then one day Barbara, who was John, Barbara and Salman, Barbara was clearly the daughter and the one that really sort of put them on the map because she was the one that discovered Yoji and Eerie and all the, you know, she had all the British and she walked in one day and saw the store and she's like, who did this? And first I thought, that's either going to be good or bad. And I was like, I did. And she's like, wow, she's like, so can you go to 72 and do the floor? And can you go to sports store? And I was like, sure, I'll do them all. And so they had me read and I was like 20, I think, like 19 or 20. And so she has me merchandising the stores. And probably like within that year, she was like, I think I want to take you to Europe, making my assistant. So what do you think of that? And I was just like, whoa, you know, and that, that I now I joke because I say my buying career basically started with body map and ended with Belgians because it was like, that was just this, you know, it's just amazing how many things happened in that period that I was able to see. The, and my, for literally my first trip to Paris was the year that it was Vivian Westwood's big comeback year. And that's when she did the mini cranny, which just everyone had sort of like gone off her. And this was like her rebirth in Paris. And that was also the season of Romeo and Gilles first show in Paris. And, you know, then as it, you know, like that was all her market was all of that. It was goatee, Asidine Mughler, Irie, Yoji, Kondegar Song, Issei, like it was just, you know, I just felt like I was dropped into like a complete and then London. That was like the era of body map and Marxist theory and Liza Bruce. And I mean, just, just literally that, like all the things that I couldn't, I would read about these things and didn't believe now, oh, wow, I'm here in their showrooms and like, literally, yeah, and to watch the the 80s, you know, when, because her mother did Italy. So Italy was Jenny, Bblos, and then Montana, you know, that was all the, you know, the really big era of that. And it was really interesting how all of us, you know, and every one of their stores, they had six stores that each store had a different image. So it wasn't the same thing in every store. So, you know, 72 was the Italians and that was Armani and Kenzo and, you know, Barbara had the workshop, which was Yoji, Issei, Irie, all the British, you know, and then 57 was kind of the best of all. So, you know, they had a lady store, which was also much more, you know, you know, we carried ziled addresses and like, you know, that was really more like for the Upper West Side Woman floppy hats of flowers on, you know, they really knew who each person in each of these stores was. And that was the reason they were so fascinating because every store was a completely different world. And it was just fun to see all of these things at one time. But the most interesting thing was when the Gulf War happened and everybody sort of like started cocooning and staying in and getting depressed. And it was really ostentatious to walk into a room and have your clothes speak for you. And that was really the beginning of the Belgians. And I remember like helmet was already coming. So there was all that buzz around helmet. And then then literally in one season, Anne and Dries sort of really came and then Martin Margiela and he actually called Barbara personally because he wanted to already be the first store in America to carry him. The amazing thing about that was like literally one season we were selling tons of Montana and color and coats and all, you know, and then one season later, we couldn't give it away because the Belgians just so radically changed the way people thought about clothes and like with Anne, everything was black. Everything was cut on the bias. So literally a woman was a woman who wore a size two and a woman who wore a size 12 could wear the same dress and the same jacket. So and you know, and women just came in and completely re-warred themselves with that and with Dries and with and then Margiela just really like the just the fact that what people take for granted now as that sort of deconstructivism, it just blew people away. And it was interesting because the other ones that really survived that crossover were still that was also like the zenith of Gili. So that was just the artisanal part of that. And Gautier, that was really, you know, for like six seasons in a row, there was the Hasidic collection and the Icelandic collection, you know, and the India collection like him. He just was like, it was just mind blowing how and then as any just a complete, like steady through that, because that was the most fun thing to buy and sell because just the transformative power of those clothes to a woman. And I remember just thinking what a genius he was, because when he showed the Tati collection, they came out and were like, which people also don't realize, because that was like the early nineties. And it was really when plastic surgery was coming into its own. So he actually came out and he said, they said, how many of your customers would you think have natural breasts and how many have been augmented? And we're like, well, we don't know. So I don't, you know, I mean, you at that point, you wouldn't really ask someone if they had a boob job, you could sort of tell or not tell. But he's like, well, as an he's now developed two bra sizes. So here's the bra size for someone who has had a breast job. And here is the bra size. So because he really hated the whole like the vulgarness is like, this will keep them from looking vulgar and spilling. And I just thought, wow, like, I can't believe like this is how people think and create. So it's, yeah. So for me now, when I see all of these re-dos of the houses, it's just too difficult for me. You know, I just have such a different context to it. It's just hard for me to say that a lot of these things should exist. They should just. Yes. Yeah. I, I, I understand. And, and everyone should follow James on Instagram. He does great commentary during the shows and beyond. You have a really important point of view that makes people think differently about this stuff.

So how did you get, and I want to talk more about what's happening there soon, but I want to hear about how you became a casting director. How did you move from being a buyer? Because when did Charivari close like in the mid 90s? Yeah, they closed by left. So I left in 94 and they probably closed like three years, somewhere like two or three years after. And at the time, even though it was the best job in the world, my barber was an incredibly tough person and I just felt like I had run my course there. And I started to miss the old fashion show world because I had done so much of that before and that was kind of what got me into the world. And I just thought, I really miss working on shows. And our PR company was a company called Kevin Criar and Associates and he was one of the big show producers in New York. And one day we were just chatting and he's like, why don't you come work for me? And so I was like, okay, so having never produced a show or cast a show, or do anything, I went to work for him and the first person he handed me was Todd Oldham. So, same thing during the whole. And that was a cool era of New York too, because at that time, even though Calvin and Donna and Rat Like They All really existed, really the shows in that time were Todd, Anna, Isaac and Giorgio Sanangelo. Like that was really, those shows were like super model central. They were one things the girls would absolutely do because it was just, it was always a part, they were just the most fun shows to work on. And back then, because most people, this was still before, you know, LVMH and Caring came, you know, still when things were relatively small and everyone showed two collections a year. Back then, people weren't really in house. So basically, when I was working on a show then, you basically did it all. So you cast it, you did the locations, you did the production, you know, you did the full production and casting was a small part of it because at that point, the modeling industry was very small. There were 10 agencies, you know, that was the era of, especially then, that was the beginning of the super models, but it was still, it was very small industry. So like every agency probably had 25 or 30 girls. So you didn't really have to do go see things. It wasn't about new, it was about consistency. And there were less shows. So basically, if you were those girls, you were probably doing 15 shows in New York or 20 shows in New York. And you would, there were big breaks because that's the other thing is you would go, the buying season was so long. So everyone would start in Milan. You do like 10 days of Milan, you get four days off. Then you would go to London and you would do another week there and then like two weeks in Paris with giant breaks in between. Then there'd be like two weeks and then New York was the end. So it was actually a much more, it was less frantic. So you had breaks in between, you had time, you know, you weren't going to 10 shows in five locations, you were going to like three or four days. So you, everything was really spread out and much easier. So we could do a lot of shows. And basically, I worked for Kevin for several years, but our big break at Kevin Crier was one day the phone rang. We were also the first company to start working in Europe because American companies did not work in Europe. And we went to Milan and we were doing a few small menswear things there and he worked a lot for Armani and then Cretia Hyres, which was like, at the time it was about, they wanted to remake themselves and they wanted to have a new image. And so we brought on Andre Leontali, who was styling the show. And all of a sudden like Cretia, like kind of, I wouldn't say became a thing, but it went from being the same thing, your grandmother's Cretia to something that people would shoot and people would buy and they got their Italian Vogue cover. So they were super happy. And then the phone rang and it was, it was time for it. And I knew him because Cathy Hardwick was one of the lines that we bought for our woman's store and he was working at Cathy Hardwick and everyone was like, oh, this is Tom Ford. He's the boyfriend of Richard Buckley, who at the time was a huge journalist. So he was like the new kid on the block, but he called and he said, I just moved to Milan. I'm about to start a Gucci. We've done one show, which is just not what I'm about. And he just said, would you guys be willing to come over and get this started? And that was for me, that, you know, for all of us that were really on top of Kevin was ready on the map, but this put him on the map and put us all on the map. And yeah, the literally that show, the very first show, which I remember, we did the men's show in Florence and it was at that point, I had a lot of we did a lot of men's wear shows and a lot of shows in New York. So it was also the first time in America was coming to deal with the. Agencies and they're all like, yeah, who you are. We don't care who you are. Like nobody's doing this. And I remember we did the show in Florence. And I got off the train. I was waiting for the train because all the Italian agencies said they put the boys on a train. I got to the train. Nobody's there. And I was like, this is bad. So then I just called all their American agents and I was like, look, get them on the train. All the boys wound up on the train and every millennia agency was like, whoa, I'm like, I was like, yeah, don't don't mess. I was like, these boys know me. They know us. This is going to be a great thing. And like, don't, you know, don't throw an opportunity out the window. But these boys all did it as a favor to me. So they all got on the train. They all came. The show was a huge hit. And then the next season was the was was the velvet. Yeah, the velvet, the famous show, the first famous show. And the same thing I remember like every girl. Christie said no. Linda said no. Naomi said no. Chris McMann, me canceled the night for the show. Like they were all just like, didn't want to do it. And at that point, this was just the beginning of Amber Shalem and Kate. Like, so I wouldn't say they didn't have the power to say no, but they were like, it's a show, you know. But it was funny during the fittings. Everyone, all the girls were talking like, oh, my God, these clothes are amazing. They're amazing. You really, this is going to be something. And I don't think anyone really knew. And I have to say one of my favorite places to be being in the audience is fun. But being in the backstage is really incredible because when a moment happens, you really you feel it coming from the audience and you just you feel that energy backstage and you're just like, oh, my God, oh, my God. And you know, this was also again the peak after the Gulf War. Minimalism was in everyone was depressed. The most important designer in the world at that point was Jill Sander. And she had just set a level of like, this is simplicity. This is the show like and everyone sort of followed suit. So I remember when literally the amber walked out, the music started and people just started applauding and then Shalom came out and they started applauding and people were just losing their mind and we were just not nobody knew that was going to happen. And we were just all like, wow. And then, you know, standing ovation and, you know, it was just incredible. And like after that, like you couldn't and he is funny. He really established at that moment, like, you know, there weren't enough clothes, you know, shows at that point also, that's something he changed shows at that point were 150, 200, 300 outfits long. So shows were like 45 minutes to an hour long. There weren't enough clothes to make the show. So he's there. There were probably like 18 women's outfits and he's like, we're going to bring the men in, we will do a men's and women's show and we will spotlight them because that will take the time. To spill up the, you know, and it ended up being like a 30 minute show. But I think people were also blown away with like, wow, here is a very quick statement and a very, it also changed the way people, you know, people started cutting down outfits and cutting down, you know, because he was just so laser sharp about how, you know, how that was going to be. And that really, like I said, that established his style, it established a lot of things that went on, you know, to change in the industry. And it was also the first time someone really worked, you know, with a collaborator because he worked a lot with Karine and there was just, you know, Paris Vogue was about to happen. So all the girls knew like, oh, you know, there's just something going on here. And that was just a super like magic moment. And Karine Reutfeld for the uninitiated add the names. And when you were talking earlier about all the American designers, Isaac Miserachie and Anna Suey were big in New York. But so when you were casting at this point, so a show like that for first women's Gucci show, Tom Ford. And you're you obviously want big models, important models, but like, were you pairing models to designer aesthetic or was it more or or or vibe or was it more about getting if it's a big brand, you want the most famous mot like how did you start thinking strategically about how to cast? Well, at the time, a lot of it was. You know, the pool of girls was a pool of girls. So it was like it was about getting the best girls that were in that time. And this again, this was just the beginning of the switchover of like, you know, the supermodels were in their zenith, but they were already all kind of moving on. And then, you know, then there was the wave, which was Amber Shalom, Carolyn Murphy, Christy Hewitt. You know, this was just the next this was the next round. But Tom is actually the one that changed my eye that sort of made it about aesthetic. The one thing that I missed about that time, him and everyone, them people were super loyal, you know, models careers, especially, you know, your crews were like 10, 15, 20 years and your runway careers were very long. So like people and, you know, again, those shows were used to sell clothes and I can't tell you how many times it like, you know, someone would say, oh, you know, because Naomi wore that dress in the show, I sold 300 of those dress, you know, like models sold clothes and, you know, the performance sold the clothes and he would come in. Well, and this is the difference about that year of model. He would come in and say, OK, this show is about Romy Schneider. So I wouldn't go looking for girls. We would just turn those girls into that character. And that's what people don't realize that, you know, like that's why Linda was so great. That's why Christy was, you know, Linda could be in helmet lying and be completely stripped down and then she could be in Valentino with tons of hair and makeup. But you never said, oh, that's Linda. You know, it was just like, this is Linda in the world of Valentino. This is Linda in the world of Tom. You know, that was a thing that I'm sad for models. They don't get to be the characters. You know, now it's just like, OK, this show is about Twiggy. Find me 55 girls that look like Twiggy, you know, not like character and personality didn't matter. And back then it was all about character and personality. So Tom's Tom's message was like, I don't care where they come from or what they do. They just have to look rich like that is, you know, or the boys have to look like they were kept like that was always his, you know, so that was he always came in with the theme every season, you know, like the Las Vegas show was like, I can't remember. He's like, what a share and somebody had a baby. And I was like, oh, OK, that's Christy. You know, it was just it was really it was much more fun. And again, you know, because something like, you know, Todd Oldham, where it was just completely performance, that was just about getting the girls who could really, really walk and really model and really, you know, go to town and and act. So, you know, this and like said, this kind of party went on for years. It was just and and the nice thing is still there weren't a lot, a lot of shows then. So you were kind of like this traveling circus that, you know, went from New York to Milan to Paris. And it was always the same, you know, it was just kind of this nice familiar group of what I thought felt like a safe place for a lot of people. And the thing that really changed the business drastically was when Vogue started doing celebrity covers, because to be a model in that era, basically, you had to walk in and be beautiful enough to get a Vogue cover, like because that was it. If you weren't getting that cover, then you were going to be commercial, you were going to be something else. But to get that cover was you had. So the standard of beauty was just really, really, really high. And then when celebrities started to take the covers and the advertising, a lot of those girls were like, I'm out. And it just became, you know, this again, it became about then stylists became very powerful. And it wasn't really about the designer's vision anymore, because they ate collections a year and they really needed to foreign out some of these jobs to people. And, you know, again, you'd have a stylist come in and say, well, this season it's about Keepe dolls and next season it's about Marilyn Monroe. Like, so it was never like, you know, in that day, you'd be like, well, Linda can be all those people. Christy can be all those people. Naomi, you know, now it's just like, no, I need a girl that looks just like that. And Tom Ford had left the Gucci group, which at the time it was really about the Gucci and the Prada girl. Like, those are the girls, you know, getting a Gucci show would completely launch your career. Like that was just getting a Prada show would completely launch your career. And now it wasn't, it wasn't about that anymore. It was just about a body that fit a theme. And so though it was great for magazine sales, it was really, really, really detrimental to the industry.

Did you know Long Nguyen? Yes. Yes. Yeah. So I mean, he was writing that book about before he passed away about the nineties and he was so obsessed with that being sort of the peak of the golden age of fashion. And it is in so many ways like before the formation of the conglomerates. Before it really did become this commodified business 20 years later and now we're sort of reckoning with what happened. But it did. It was like a confluence of all these things. The magazines were at their peak. Creativity was at its peak. And there was also a commercial interest so it could thrive. It must have been amazing to be at the center of it and help like be a big part of making those images and making it all sort of come to life by casting. Yeah, it was incredible. Like I did, you know, I didn't think at the time, you know, I didn't think, you know, I did, but I didn't think at the time like, well, I never thought it would end. So that was, you know, that I guess was then act two for me after that all ended. But no, yeah. And there's just on a level of creativity and a level of money, you know, people would just, you know, you paid to get the image right. You paid to get the show right. You paid to get the fitting right. You paid to get the girl and the guy you wanted there, you know, and like said that again, that, you know, there was the vote thing, but the other thing that like really was the upstart of that era was Liz Tolberius's Harper's Bazaar. I mean, that just entered an entire new era. You got Craig McDean, you had David Sims, you had Inez and the Nude. You know, you had even the greats like Peter, you know, a lot of people defected to work for her. You also had, you know, the real beginning of the zenith of Stephen Misele of the Italian vote. Like there were just, there were, I mean, just the amount of photographers and, you know, you still had a lot of the greats were still, were still around then. And, you know, you still had Abaddon, you still had school. They were all alive. And like, you know, all these models really got the opportunity to work with every single one of those people. And, you know, there was just so much advertising. Like, you know, there were lookbooks, like even lookbooks were shot by Mario Sorrenti and Stephen Misele. You know, you just go back and it's funny because you see all these book dealers selling all these old lookbooks and you're like, wow, I forgot about like, you know, no, it was just, it was, it was incredible. And it was like, said, it all felt so collaborative. I mean, like I said, we, I really always likened our jobs to being a traveling circus. And like, you know, then you had show season and then you had print season and then, you know, there was just, it never ended. You just had these nice kind of blocks in between. And then you all be back together in the fall. It was really, yeah. And then, you know, the 9-11 changed that because everyone pulled back their budgets. And even though a lot of people had these budgets, they were just like, well, now I can, I can say we have no budget and still get that same talent. And that, that was kind of also the beginning of like, it got a little like people weren't getting what they were worth. And especially the models and they're like, yeah, I'm not, not going to do this anymore for, you know, I've made my money. So I'm done. For those net, like what were the 2000s and the 2010s like for you and, and observing? Because when did you officially retire from, from casting or unofficially? I retired like, I think now it's like seven years ago, even though it feels like I keep everything feels like five years to me. Yes. So much happened in, you know, I think we kind of freeze out a couple of years because of COVID. So we just kind of lived in, you know, in suspended animation. But yeah, so, so, you know, the whole glory day, you know, that was all happening. And then I would say the beginning, the beginning of the end a little bit was 9-11 because that is really when people started to pull back on their budgets. But that was also again, you know, magazines started relying on celebrities for advertising for, and at the time celebrities used to Kate Moss still got more than an actress did to do something. So celebrities at the time were a much less expensive and a far more reaching way to reach people. But what that caused, especially on the show circuit, and this was also the rise of the stylist. So you kind of got these stylists and casting directors that are, you know, you have one stylist working for five brands, you had another stylist working for five brands. And what I loved about the business when I came into it, it was super collaborative. You know, I would get on the phone. I'd be like, oh my God, I just met a girl. Like, and at the time in the very beginning, that late 80s, early 90s, when we were doing production and casting, it was me, John Pfeiffer, Michelle Lee, Nyan Fish, you know. And then Alex Patak was the new kid in town. So we were all these little, you know, we all worked together. Like I could literally call John and say like, I just met this girl, get her on a play, you know, when this next era happened. Uh, one stylist, you know, and this is where the pretend I don't have a budget came in. Well, I will have a lot of power. I have seven shows. You're going to fly yourself for free now to do my work. And if you don't, I'll just blackball you. That then stylist B would be like, well, if you work with them, you're not working with me. And this really started this kind of level of abuse that was kind of unreal to witness. And, uh, and for me, this was such, I escaped my world to come into this world and be in this, this place with all of these creative people. And then all of a sudden, like all the bullies of my past wound up in my backyard. And then the other thing that really changed was Russia and Brazil opened. And in, you know, now that models were started becoming dispensable, you know, in the old days, there were 50 magazines. And so if you walked into an agency, you started at 17 and then Glamour and then Mademoiselle and you worked your way to Vogue. And then, you know, that was the trajectory. So, you know, a model had a lot of practice before she was ever put before. Richard Avedon, you know, so, um, that was all burning out because, uh, again, actresses were now getting these covers. They were, you know, so there was no, you know, and then the beauty standard started to change. And then, uh, Brazil and Russia opened and that really, you know, so like I said, a girl would start, even if she started at 14, back in the day, you could work in the summers, you had to go back to school. Most agencies wouldn't put you out for serious work until you were 18. So by the time, you know, even the Lindas and the, you know, there were some exceptions, but those women had worked a lot. They cut their teeth before their break happened. Um, uh, then it just turned into these girls aren't getting campaigns. So we just need a constant person to feel like said, oh, this week is about Pollyanna and next week is about, you know, and in a colestinate, you know, so we're just going to find bodies and not necessarily models. And it opened the world to a lot of teenagers coming into the business. And Prada kind of really came up with this sort of Lolita-esque aesthetic, especially after like Kristian, when they were gone, it just became these really, really young Russian and Brazilian girls who, um, who were A, not equipped. You know, my whole thing was you should never ask child to do an adult's job. And even as an 18 year old being thrown in that world is it's a lot. And it really can do a lot to your self-esteem in your head. And what happened was all of these young girls would come to the business. Every stylist to be like, oh my God, I have to have this kid. I have to have this kid. I saw her in Prada. Uh, and, and the other crazy thing was that was when style. Uh, style.com started. So before that you used to have, you used to be able to do your own thing. If you're working for a designer, you had your own cast, you had the girl say like, but then all of a sudden everyone go on style.com and be like, I saw her in Prada. I have to have her. I'm like, yeah, but she doesn't look like that in real life. And at Prada, you don't have to walk. And she's 14 and gangly and Pat and Guida are doing an amazing job transforming her into someone she's not. So when you see her in real life, you're going to be pretty shocked. And in the end, it just started this whole era of teenage girls, uh, who were too young to be in this in the first place. And the aesthetic just became like no breasts, no hips, no personality. But the problem is when these girls wanted to stay in the business and they started to go through puberty, they were told by every editor they were fat. So you can't really tell a 14 year old who's getting breasts for the first time that she's that. So you have all these teenage girls that are now like taking Adderall and Red Bull not to it started a huge epidemic of that, of just and then because then you're not hungry and you're full of energy. And, you know, so they'd be in a Prada ad one season and then the next season, everyone was like, I want nothing to do with you. And for me, that was, I was so used to relationships. It was very hard to explain to a child why everyone likes you this season and next season. They don't want you because you made someone angry or you didn't do their free job. And so that for me was, I really felt like I had to do something about it. Um, and in general, I was not in rare occasions, but in general, I was not, I would just tell the agencies, don't send me anyone under 18 unless they're shopper owned, you know, occasionally they're always going to be a girl. You know, I wouldn't say I was a hundred percent angelic on this, but I also knew how to take care of people and make sure that when they came to Arsha's that they were taken care of that their fittings were fast that we didn't leave them overnight. But it just the level of abuse really just spiraled out of control. And I think people just didn't even, you know, they started seeing models, not even as people, but just as things. And I would always say to these styles, like, you have a kid, like doesn't, you know, don't you realize you're, you know, like you're really, you know, one thing you say that you think is, you know, if someone's brushing it off, you know, you tell a 14 year old girl, she's fat, like that could ruin her life. Cause she just spirals into this. How do I, you know, how do I not grow breasts? How do I not get taller? How do I, you know, like, there was just thousands of girls out there now in this brain set. And so I started, I started to speak out about it. And things just sort of got worse. But the great thing was business fashion came out and they were going to do their first, their first voices, the voices. Yes. They did the first one. So I called Imran and I was just like, there's a huge problem in the business. You okay? I was like, can you write something about it? And he was like, why don't you come and speak? So I thought, sure, sure, get me on. You know, so I, I literally, there were like eight people who were incredibly powerful and even more, but really eight people who I just thought were really the, the, the core of this abuse. And it was just, and again, because they were pitted against each other and then just using these girls as bonds. Yeah. I basically went and told eight of these stories about each particular person. And I just said, I'm not going to say your names, but we're going into fashion week. And if you ignore this, I'm going to attach everyone your names to the stories. And so I got to Paris and everyone was like, holy shit, like everyone is freaking out. And I'm like, well, I'm not, I'm not kidding. So, you know, I just like people have to put a mirror to themselves and see they're really ruining, ruining so many lives of teenage girls and boys that, you know, they're, have these kids are coming to support a family, have these kids don't even want to be models. Like they were in a cornfield last week and now you're asking them, you know, to be a vamp of Versace. You can't like, you know, with no practice, you know, every other girl like was able to build themselves up to that point in their lives. And so, yeah. So then the famous Balenciaga incident happened where my dad and Rami had locked 300 girls in a room and turned off the lights and left them there for like six hours. And I was at a casting and one of the girls came in and burst out crying and told me what happened. And I was like, all right, I've had it. So, you know, this was the beginning of Instagram. So I went on Instagram and made a post and it went viral in like two hours. And I didn't realize it because the internet at Selma Courtney was so bad that I used to have to go down the street to send business texts. And then the PR director of the company is like, you're, you need to go to Pino's office. And I thought, why? And I was like, what did I do? He's like, you're post on viral. He's like, it's a disaster. Like he's what disaster for that, not for me. But so I went and I mean, literally, like, I just had thousands of messages on my email, my phone, my like just people were trying to get hold of me all over the place. And so I went to his office and he just, he said, today you're the most powerful person in this industry. What do you want? And I had wanted before to get someone from carrying an LBMH in room and come up with something to sort of stop the flow of these girls. And I just said, look, you know, you're employing all these people who are abusing these girls, like you just, the lawsuits are incredible. Like one girl is going to wake up one morning and they're all going to take you down. Like once one does, they're all going to come and say, you know, I was like, you really, you can't do this. Uh, so, and then I didn't realize like literally on my Instagram, like, uh, Antoine Arnaud reached out to me and I thought it was, I thought he was a joke. And he's like, no, get ahold of me. So I just, I literally said, I would love for you and Antoine to get in a room and let's see what we can do to protect these girls. And, uh, he agreed LBMH is like, no, no, no. And then I just said, there was something happening at LBMH. That day, uh, there was super abusive and someone had sent me pictures and I just said to him, I was like, if we can't sit that on the table, this is going out today. And it's going to be really, really bad. Um, and so then over the course of the year, we developed the LBMH carrying, uh, charter and then the Vogue charter, which is the continuity, you know, and basically what it mostly did was, uh, it did not allow anyone under 18 to go on a casting or work on a show or an advertising unless they were chaperoned and it was put, but it basically stopped the flow of every, like thousands of kids coming through Europe that were never going to work or we're going to have one job and be sent home and be in debt to an agency. And that once that happened, I was like, I'm done here. Like I feel like I'm aging out and, uh, maybe, you know, and there was, dude, there were new kids on the block and I was like, it's their time, you know, and, and when I was 50, uh, Tom Ford took me out and he was like, what's your five year plan? Cause that was always his thing. I was like, I don't think that far. Like I don't have a five year plan. Like, and he's like, well, he goes, you can't be a 55 year old casting director. And I was just like, Oh, I was like gut punched. And I was like, and I was like, I just thought, you know what, you're right. So I'm out. And so I slowly started getting out and then made my, you know, did my last show season and then I was like, I'm retired. So that was. So now we're going to talk shop, but actual shop, but really quickly, do you feel like the work that you did? Cause I think I, I mean, I would definitely was at voices. I don't remember most, most of the last 10 years of, because I barely slept, but I remember that, that you having them on stage and drawing up the, like working on different concepts in all these salons at voices at this big event, BOF does every year. And do you feel like the industry changed? Do you think that people are more careful now than they were? Or, or they think more about how they treat people from, from every, all that work you did? I hope so. I'm so far distanced from it. And I do have to say it, like still, I would say sometimes even once a week, I spill, get someone who saw, saw about it, who thinks it was last year. Yeah. So it's pretty amazing that that is still out there. Um, uh, I definitely knew it stopped the flow of the amount of young people, like coming into that business. You know, at the end of the day, I think Vogue pretty much sticks to the, you know, the whole Coney Nass charter is still, you know, unless you're a celebrity's kid or something, you're not getting on the pages of that magazine. And, um, uh, for that, that was, and the one thing I will say is those seven or eight people, some of them are gone and the rest, it really put them on a leash because one of the things that people have to remember was that if LVMH or caring hired a person that was doing something abusive, um, and it was reported that person could never work for any of their brands ever again. And that was part of the, for me, that was the thing that was like, okay, that's what I really want because then they're just out and they're done. But no, it pretty much put everyone else on a leash. And occasionally people still call me and they're like, this one's doing this and this one's doing that. I'm like, look, I left you the tools. Like, yeah, you have to, it's up to you. Like social media is very parallel. You could stop someone in five seconds with social media. So don't, you know, you created these monsters. It was not my job to get rid of them. It was your job to take better care of your talent. And you knew what was going on. And, you know, you should never have let it happen. Yeah. So now you're tackling a whole other problem in the fashion industry, which is the challenge of the riddle of retail, which you, even in the 90s, when you were, you were working at retail, it was challenged. I talked to Gene Pressman a few days ago and he said, you know, this was retail was Chad department stores, retail was challenged before, before the internet. And then you, you moved to Hudson, you end up opening the store. Talk about the concept for Jamestown, what the reaction has been, what you've created with it, because I hear about it from people who are upstate. And it's, it is, it does feel like very word of mouth. It's, it's not like I read it in a magazine because no one reads magazines anymore. But what, what made you want to do it? You know, I always wanted to do it. I had sort of two aborted attempts. I was attempting to do something in 2001 and then 9-11 just killed the whole, the whole idea. Like I said, first, as much as I love fashion shows, as much as I love buying, as my, like, I love stores, like my whole life, like you could put me in any town on the planet. And the first thing I will do before I hit a beach or any, like, I will go to a store and I will buy something. And I will buy something. Like I love to see how stores represent the places that they're in. And, you know, the amazing thing is during my Chavar years, there were just so many incredible, incredible small boutiques all over the world, like ours, that just had these amazing people with these amazing points of view. And it was just interesting, you know, that they could cherry pick these lines and somehow create a world and create a world out of that. And as I was living up here, I was perfectly happy doing nothing. And then when my partner was like, let's not go back, he came downstairs one day and he's like, you're opening that story. He always wanted to open. I was like, no, I was like, that should be sailed. I don't, I really don't. I don't know how I would think about doing this. And then there was a space that I thought if this ever came up, we're in business. And one day that space fell on my lap and he's like, now we're doing it. And I just thought, okay. So the idea is based on some of the places that I always loved shopping when I was younger and, you know, like Fred Siegel, Henry Lair, just these sort of emporiums of things that weren't necessarily design or anything. It was more that they would create a world and you could go into this world and just buy the coolest T-shirt or the greatest pair of pants. And even though they were a fortune, somehow they made these really kind of expensive, amazing things feel very sporty. And, you know, as retail just started, you know, like department stores got boring and the whole like conglomeration of, you know, the Chanel's and all of that, you know, and these were also brands and product things that I would have bought for myself personally, but it just, all of it has become so big that it probably like me, like many people, it turned me off. But I just felt like, especially in the last five or 10 years, there are just these small boutiques coming up all over that exist and some new ones that just really do something personal for people who really do, because people love to buy clothes and my customers love to buy clothes and, you know, places like Lost and Found and Noodle Stories and Mohawk, like all these things started to happen like 10 years and I'd go to LA for work and I'm like, wow, these are like, this is where I want to shop. These are the cool stores, Map in Provincetown. Like they're just, they're all these kind of great, I mean, even in Portland, Maine, there are like stores that carry really things that would surprise you. And I'm like, you'd think like, wow, these people are important, Maine, and they are. And I just, as I started to think about it, I was like, you know, I'm living up here. There are just so many great looking people. There are a lot of people visiting this town. We're kind of like the epicenter of a new tourist. We're becoming a huge tourist town, mostly because we also have ski resorts. So there's something to do. It's a very outdoor lifestyle up here. So when I decided to do this, I just thought my partner and I were like, well, the best thing would be like, I'm just going to raid my closet. And approach all the people that I personally wear and love and ask if they would help us out. And it was originally just going to be a men's store and then the woman's space opened. And again, in a full circle moment, this was kind of an amazing creation of all the people that I've known my entire business in different realms who've been able to help me out. And so the first thing I did when I was putting the women's together, I was like, I'm going to call Christina Kim from Dove said because I used to buy at Charivari and she's still doing a small and she was like, I will sell you. And then we got, I spoke with Maurizio Donati years ago on a sustainability conference. And he in the menswear world, especially in the creative world, in the world of vintage, like serious vintage collectors, he is like a God and he basically takes, he has a warehouse of rooms and rooms of vintage clothes in Los Angeles. And he comes up with a theme and he recreates these clothes pretty much like rare military old polo from the 70s and 80s. And he just totally rebuilds these clothes into a theme. And kind of getting him Christina and then double RL, then the rest of the industry is like, oh, like you're doing something all little like I'd love to work with you. So I was able to pretty much assemble a roster of people that I personally believe in. And it was really, it was fun because and our men and women's customer are different, but the same. But I just felt like there's a realm of people who shop in the world that never went into department stores that really do believe in beautiful clothes that say some fading that are transformative to each person that shops in the store. And on the women's side, besides Dosa, there's a German designer that we also years ago bought a charvara called Hano Wessel and Pada Calle, which is this Japanese brand. Women who buy that collect it. And the again, these clothes, they're not cheap, but they're not expensive. And most of these things, the jackets are reversible, they're made of different, you know, like everything has a lining, you open the jacket, and there's a beautiful tape trim with maybe some embroidery, you know, it just, it's all these kind of little details that I personally love. And by living up here and watching people, I really thought like, oh, this is really this woman up here. And she's, I don't know where she's shopping. And this is the guy. So I'm just going to assemble this group of things to feel very personal to me and see how it flies. And it really, I hit a nerve pretty quick. I have so many questions for you about this part of your career. So are you going to write a book? Everyone asks me that. And I like, Kate Petz has told me like forever, like you have a book in you, like you have to have to, I just don't know when I would do it now. But all my partners dying for me to write one too. You should do it. So a couple of things. One is, you messaged me a few weeks ago about, I had gotten feedback from a reader, say, who was talking about like the way Gen Z versus Millennial shop and things like that. I believe in retail, I believe in stores, but I see it from my life myself. And I was talking, I was with a talent agent last night at this Tory Burch thing, and she's a big shopper. But she was like, I just don't. And I was actually with another person yesterday, a Hollywood person who loves fashion and was like, I used to go to Barney's, I don't, there are great shops in LA. It's not conducive and maybe because you're on the main street in Hudson, there's lots of foot traffic, that sort of thing. Even in New York, it's just in New York, there's a little more, I'm going to go to the store. But in California and in these like car cultures, we just live in this world now, I never go shopping. I never, I'll go to Scout maybe once every six months, which everyone on this who listens podcast wants to kill me because I mentioned Scout, every other podcast, but I'll go to Scout, I'll go to a couple shops. But it's not as much a part of the cultures that used to be. So what do you think you're doing right that's making it work? Like what's the mix? Because you also don't have online retail, right? So how are you making it happen? Because you're and you're not promowing like crazy on the Instagram account either. So no, but I guess like very quick, this is kind of where the word of mouth and having been in this industry for so long, I was able to really reach out to designers that I worked with to reach out with showrooms that I worked with to Alan Castro, who was the art director back in the time for Gucci days, like he rang me up one day is like, I'd love to do your logo. And he in one hour came back with like the Jamestown logo and you know, the whole thing is like, we just really wanted to have a place that felt very positive, super happy. The music is great. Like everyone just comes in and they're like, we love the music, we love the whole feeling of the store, even, you know, which was very important, you know, just a really fun place to shop. And you know, same thing, I was able, you know, I worked at Samira, she wrote something in Bazaar, Nick Sullivan wrote something in Esquire, you know, Business of Fashion wrote a thing about our, you know, like I was able to call every press person I knew, like get something out, which all of, and Vogue and all of these things have really did cause word of mouth. But the coolest thing is that now the customers who come in and shop are really like, my son came in here and told me I would love this store. And besides a lot of New Yorkers who come and visit, I now really have like steady people coming from Boston, coming from Philadelphia. They're like, we're up, yeah, I didn't realize Boston was so close. And I had a woman come in, she's like, oh, my girlfriend came in and, you know, bought some really nice things. So here are me and my friends and they like come down and now people just call me on the phone. They're like, oh, my girlfriend was in, send me some, you know, I do a lot of phone business now just because someone came in. And like for me, the word of mouth blows me away. Like I just cannot believe how many people just said my friend, especially this last weekend, my friend told me and here I am with my family. Like here is my son, here is my what, like let's all go shopping together. And that was really like said, and the fact that I consciously chose a lot of brands that don't have websites that are not in department stores that are not on the seasonal marked down calendar. So like I really sell in season, like we did not put a piece of spring out till April 1st. So April 1st, I did a blast. We had probably 40 of our regular customers came in and one of the biggest weekends since we opened. And since we have opened, we have profited every month and we broke even in our first year, which was last Saturday. And just now we've started the new month and we're double ahead of what we thought we would be. So it's really, it's really, you know, knock wood. Yeah, well, any final thoughts? Do you think that the key, I've been thinking about this a lot. And because of all the sex global stuff that we're in the middle of, they just reached out to, they say to find new financing, but they hire people who usually do restructurings. Who knows by the time this publishes a few days from now, what will the situation will be. But I'm curious to know from you, like, do you think that the key to retail now is keeping small and specific and managing it? Yeah. Absolutely. Because I feel like, you know, again, like if you think of some of the greatest boutiques in this country that have been 30, 40 years, you know, like Amaris, like, you know, like Henry there, which has five stores in the Hamptons, no website and their store kills it every year. The other person that really inspired me to open a store was Tina, which I thought was one of the greatest stores, you know, like, and there was a reason that people went to Tina, you know, like, I just think, and one of the other reasons I opened a store was that when I moved up here, it was really interesting to me that someone would take a barn 40 miles into the Catskills, which is an hour away from here. And there would be people lined up to get in there. And I was like, people will go and travel for something that is incredible. And I thought, I, you know, and I thought, wow, if I can just do that in Hudson and become a destination, I just feel like destination shopping has been a thing for a while. Like, I feel like everyone I know in New York goes to Hershalifers, you know, they don't shop in New York anymore. They're going, you know, or now they're going all the way to Brooklyn and go into an event space, you know, they're just, you'll go where there is somewhere that caters to what you want. And I truly believe that destination shopping is a big thing. And I do feel like if you keep it small and personal, that is really, you know, nothing makes me happier than when someone comes in the store, whether they buy or not, and just say like, I had a great time here, like you made me feel at home. And I, you know, I just bought this glass and you just gave me a confidence that I did not have when I walked in. And like, I, like, I really believe in the transformative power of clothes. And when people, you know, try something on and they really, really love it, like, and they leave my store and they're super happy. And the other smart thing that I think we did was, was the packaging. I really wanted a beautiful bag. I wanted a great hat. And our new manager just said, Oh, the, you know, the girlies on Twitter are talking about your hat. So it's like the thing that, you know, like, and I didn't even know I was like, wow, so that's, you know, it's these kind of little things that become kind of free advertising that have sort of gotten our name out there as well. So it's been, and like I said, all of my great fashion fans, all of my great friends in publishing, they've all come to the store, they've all shopped and they've all, and they, they all come back. So it's not even like a one time visit. You know, it's pretty, it's pretty, and the amount of other retailers that have come to my store that I really admire that have just said, wow, you, I haven't seen something that got me this excited in 15 years, which I don't, you know, when I walk in the store, I'm happy this is my store, but to really see what other people think and feel when they come in your store is really the biggest reward. Yeah. Yeah, it's, I, I hope that I, I feel like destination shopping and, and it feels purposeful is the, it's the only way to do it. If you have the means and you have the, the, and you seek stuff. I mean, today all, I really have to go because I might, I have to wake my kid up, but I feel like today the only thing people want, that's why vintage is so popular. They just want something special. You were saying Nuclear and, and Romeo, Romeo Gilles and all these brands that now all these, this new generation is just constantly seeking out. You go to Paris and the, the list of brands that the vintage shops is like, Alaya, the, you know, all that's Yoji, all this stuff from the early 90s, Margiela, and because it feels special. Nothing feels special anymore. A good dress from Dosa feels special because you can only get it in, I mean, I don't know if there's anything else. She's 20 accounts in the world. That's it. It's like, you know, that's, no. And, and, and again, like a lot of interesting thing in the market is, which is not in the, the market in general, but is how many people are working with repurposed, you know, Dosa's circular rent-rayage is totally remade out of recycled clothes. Maurizio is recycled. Mon-Italy is dead stock. RTH, which I also do crazy business with, is all dead stock fabric. You know, it's just, and so it's, it's interesting that there's a whole thing that nobody talks about that's going on in the business as well. And it means a lot, especially to, like I said, to young people. Like that is even a better story, you know, than here is a new, a new shirt. Yeah. Yeah. James, thank you so much for spending so much time. We should do a part two sometime soon, but it was really fun to chat with you and, and I feel like we only scratched the surface, but there's a lot to cover. Well, I'm always around. So hopefully, hopefully next time you make it out, make it out to the East Coast and swing up and stop by. I would love that. Thank you for everything. All, all that you do. Thanks a lot.
