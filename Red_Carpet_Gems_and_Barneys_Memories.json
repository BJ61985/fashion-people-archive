Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Puck's fashion and beauty memo line sheet. And today with me on the show is jewelry designer Irene Neworth. We discuss her life in Los Angeles, the business of building a fine jewelry brand, and her love of horses. I mean the animal, not the restaurant. Let's get started. Hey everyone, it's Lauren. Before we get going, I wanted to remind you that if you like this podcast, you'll definitely love Puck, where I send an email three times a week called line sheet.

Hey everyone, hope you had a great week. The news never stops in fashion. Uh, I don't know why. Please make it stop. No, I'm just kidding. I love, I love the news, uh, but we're very much in Olympics mode right now and therefore LVMH mode. And when are we not? When are we not in LVMH mode? As you know, LVMH sponsored the Paris games and early social media tracking is showing that brand sentiment for the group, which owns Dior, Louboutin, Celine, et cetera is up since the game started. So more people know about LVMH than they did before, which was, you know, sort of the point also as, as John Oran said on the podcast a couple of weeks ago, it was also just like they're all in cahoots with the French government. And LVMH relies on France and France relies on LVMH. And so they had to do France a solid and, and do the steal, but it's been really beneficial to them. So I'll have more data on that in line sheet as the games go on, but all in all, I really think the 150 million euro they sung into this seems to have been well worth it. In other line sheet news, Rachel Strugeats, my partner in beauty, share some crucial updates on things that are happening in beauty M&A. It's early August. So if we're lucky, we'll have a deal or two to pour over by months and either in beauty or fashion. Let's get a deal going. I love a deal. This week, I also took a look at the state of Nike and this is something I'm going to cover more closely from here on out. This first piece was sort of a snapshot of what I was thinking about, but I'll be doing more reporting as the weeks go on. All my friends in Nike PR, little heads up there. You know, Nike is arguably the best brand in the world or the biggest brand in the world. It's, it's very, it's important and it has like a lot of loyalty. And you know, if you want to use startup parlance, the lifetime value of a Nike customer, I can't even imagine. I should look that up and try to figure it out because I bet it's huge. I'm sure they don't really think about that or, or have it in the past, but you know, four or five years ago, this company fell in this, visible. They didn't need to think about their lifetime value and talk about that to investors because it was invaluable. It was just the best, uh, but it's also a very complex beast. And there have been many, many challenges in the past few years that I can't even, I mean, it would, it literally needs to be a book. There's just so much going on there and in so many places where they really own the market, but, but they're, they're influences slipping. So the question up in Portland right now seems to be how long is CEO John Donahoe gonna last? Like, is he long for this world or not? He started in 2020. It's been tough. He's, he's backtracked on a lot of the changes he made and kind of going back to basics, but you know, Nike isn't a basic company. And so they, now he did need to change. It just didn't change in the right way. So we'll see, but I'll be in Portland in a few weeks. If you would like to discuss in person and hit me up for now, let's get into this chat with Irene. I, I love Irene. I love being around her. She's just a person who it's pleasurable to spend time with her. And so I hope you enjoy this as much as I did. Let's get going. Irene New Earth, welcome to fashion people. Thank you. I'm so happy to be here. What did you have for breakfast this morning? Eggs and bacon. That's so good. Coffee, lots of coffee. I'm Jerry Jutlads. Where were you? I was in London for eight weeks. Because filming. Yes. Phil is making a film there until mid-October. Where do you all stay when you're there? We went to a really cute house in Holland Park. It's been so much fun. I was there in May and, you know, when I worked at my old job, I do. I was there a lot and would not move there. I mean, not that it was really that there was that any pressure, but they would have appreciated it. And I was like, never. And then I was there in May and I was like, should we move here? And then you would have spent June and July where it rained every single day. They had the wettest summer in history. It was really hard, but it was great. I mean, I had a lot of fun being there. I really missed thinking about work. I had to work. The eight hour time difference was very hard. I mean, I got things done, but I'm happy to be home. Did you travel around Europe a bit as well? I traveled to Greece for a few days. How much of your design process comes from travel and seeing and different visuals and like landscapes and all that stuff? I used to say I was like fully inspired by traveling. And then I actually didn't travel for such a long time because of COVID. And then kind of fell into this like, how am I ever going to travel again? And it was really nice to be in a foreign country and to travel a bit and think and look at different things. So I find it really inspiring, mostly when I come home to design, not necessarily like designing while I'm traveling. No, no, that would be that might be a little hard. Except for I'm like sitting there for eight weeks with that thing to do. But yes, it would it was it was inspiring once I got home. Were you just like taking lots of walks? I walked everywhere. I walked like literally through every single park, every single museum. I went everywhere and I had my dogs. It used to be really hard to bring pets to the UK. And then they it got a little easier. The last time you did this, did you have them? I brought Teddy because I only had one dog when Phil was shooting the last movie. But this was particularly crazy. I flew on canine jets. Which is a dog. Air Lies. Of course, she did. Like the greatest 10 hours of my entire life. But yeah, it was great fun. I took all three. And we should just say that your partner is Phil Lord, who is like a movie producer and director and funny guy and all that stuff. Crazy genius. You guys are a Hollywood power couple. No, God. One of the most satisfying moments of television and watching in my life was when on hacks, they mentioned Irene New Earth. I have to tell you, it was one of the most satisfying of my life as well. I loved it. I couldn't believe it. So many people. It was like inside baseball, but not. It's totally. And I actually I interviewed. I did this HBO, FYC for your consideration, which obviously didn't know what that was. Amazing. Two years ago. But I did. I interviewed a bunch of the HBO costume designers. I think five of six got nominated for Emmy. So that's obviously because of me. Obviously, the hacks one, I think her name is Kathleen. I asked her about it and she was kind of like, who's Irene New Earth? Well, yeah, because she wasn't like a costume designer choice. It was a writer's choice. Oh, boy. But she definitely knew she's she's very good. But it was just a funny thing because I was like so excited about it. And she was like, OK, really funny. I was like, so who do we know that's writing for hacks? Who did that? But it was really cute. It was great. So it being from you're from LA, right? I am born and raised here. So being from here. Do you have the urge to travel? Like I've been living here for four years. You know, I've been coming here on and off for about 15, 10, 15 years. Right. When I am here, I don't want to leave. But that's because you didn't grow up here. Yeah. I mean, I love being here and I find that everything I need is kind of in the near vicinity, but it's so nice and healthy to get out of Los Angeles at the same time. I feel like sometimes. Well, first of all, once COVID, once the pandemic started, I really fell in love with being a hermit. I didn't see anybody. I kind of really haven't seen anybody until the summer. I've been very good at keeping things tight. So it's been really nice to travel again. It's sort of given me a new lease on life. I feel really refreshed and focused all over again. I remember coming to your house when I was on maternity leave, and it was still like pretty deep COVID. I know. I know. You're probably one of the only people I saw in three years. Prue. It was amazing. It was such a it was such a memorable, wonderful day because I like let I left my child for five hours and add to your beautiful home. I know now we need to do it again. I'm available. I'll always come to Malibu for you. Well, now I'm not there until April, but yeah. So tell me about the world that you grew up in. And what is your LA because there are many different LA's? I would say my LA when I was a child looked a lot like what my LA is now, which is full of horses. I rode horses and I kind of therefore didn't do a lot of social things when I was a kid. I mean, I was a social child and a social teenager, but really all I wanted to do was be at the barn and around horses. And ironically, that's all I wanted to do again. But I had a really wonderful time growing up here. And I also think a lot of the people that grew up in LA are a bit, you know, no one's coming here to like we all grew up here. All of my friends are from like kindergarten, elementary school, junior high school. I still have such a tight network of wonderful, creative people who I grew up with. I felt like I don't know, it wasn't full of Hollywood. It's kind of like London in that way. Yeah, it is. Exactly. Like if you grow up in London, you kind of have this amazing network. Yeah, I have a really amazing group of friends that I've had my entire life, which has been great. Is a part of that because your mom was an artist, do you think? My parents look very unholy. You know, I think that, you know, my dad is a was a really amazing business person. He's retired now, but he really instilled like an amazing work ethic. And I was never interested in being in Hollywood. In fact, when Phil and I first started dating, I was like, oh, no, like I will never date anyone in Hollywood either. But he's very unholy. What is while, even though his career is wonderful and, you know, thriving right now. My mom was really creative. She had a studio on Abbot Kinney when Abbot Kinney was definitely not what it was now. Like I remember being nervous to, you know, go hang around there when I was little. It was really funky and wild and lots of artists. It was wonderful. And she lived in the Venice canals and my dad was in Bratwood at the time when I was a kid and I would go in between the two of their homes. They got divorced when I was like 13, a really wonderful age. And perfect age for divorce. Exactly. Definitely do that to a 13 year old girl. It's a great idea. Otherwise you might end up like that. Yeah. But I don't know, I just had a really interesting that two of them to get, you know, growing up with my mom as an artist and my dad as a really conservative business person. It was like an interesting mix. And I really have both. I love the business side of my business and I obviously really love the creative side. So yeah, there is a negative connotation towards the word hustle now. Oh, but I like that. I really hustled. You really hustle. Yeah, you're a hustler. Hustle isn't really quite the word, but I work really hard and I work really hard still. And I really felt it when I was in London. I was like, wow, this is I won't just never be this like lady who lunches, even though like I thought that that would be sort of a funny thing to do for eight weeks. I was like counting down the days till I got to come home and be in my office. And I'm closely thinking about work. I love to think of ways to improve my company and prove my brand and prove the the creative side of things. And that's kind of what like keeps me alive. So the crazy thing is you've been doing it for what, 20 years? Twenty two years. Twenty two years. So how does one become a jewelry designer? I don't know, Lauren. Yeah, I made jewelry for fun. I mean, this story is like kind of silly, but I made jewelry for fun. I loved like weaving thing was I got really into, you know, like doing silly macrame when I was a kid. And then I love like really fine details. So then I got into beading and then I got into metal smithing and wax carving. And I remember I was talking to my friend, Gregory Parkinson, who at the time was an incredible clothing designer and now does amazing textiles and home things. But he got on the phone with me. I remember I made my mom a beaded necklace and she had coffee with me. I was like, I feel in the feet of my friend. I was like, I'm in a ladies walk through your room. She was like, touch him. I think he can give you some great advice. And I spoke to him and he was like, think about what you want your business to be. I was like, well, I haven't even thought about like having a business, you know. But I started thinking about things and I was like, I really know that I want my jewelry to be sold at Barney's. That was something that was, you know, my mom would bring me around Barney's when I was a little girl and I would like dream of pieces and it was such an aspirational store. And so I am I literally was like, I'm going to do this. I made 10 pieces of jewelry. I wrote a magic marker. I called Barney's. I asked who the buyer was. I overnighted the package and then I hit redial for literally a good like three hours probably until someone was like, what? What do you? I was like, I was wondering if you received my package. And they said they did. They were like, you know, kindly let me know in your New York. I was like, I'll be there the day after tomorrow. I literally like scrounged up enough money to go to New York. I will never forget my very chic outfit of clogs and a Rossi Nichols skirt. I thought I was like really chic and a Michael Starr's T-shirt. And I met with Judy Kohns and I think she was sort of charmed by my like naivety and she asked me how things were priced. And I was like, I don't know how should I price them? And she was like, you need to go back to the drawing board and like kind of get your dad to a row and then come back to us. And I sat down with my dad, who is an incredible business person, as I've mentioned, and he sort of helped me come up with a plan on how I should price things, which felt as an eye at the time. But we did it. Was he like, this business is insane. So I have a friend who has a fashion brand and her dad is also like a CEO type. And he just looked at her margins and he was like, what the hell is this? A jewelry is a little different. Well, he was like, what you need to do. I was like, I can never price it like that. Like who's going to buy something from, you know, I was 23 years old. So it was, you know, really different. And, and I wasn't my own client. So, you know, but she gave me this like great, like sort of model. And that's still how we price our jewelry now. And it's really worked. And, you know, he was obviously very correct. But I think he was sort of like, give it a whirl and then get a job because you're an educated young woman and you need to be working. Um, and I just went for it. And, you know, I sort of feel like a lot of people wait until things are perfect. And I was sort of like playing around with the whole idea like, this is something I love. Wouldn't that be fun if this happened? And then fell in love with like learning how to grow my business, meeting all of these people I traveled to nonstop. I met all of my clients. I met all of, you know, the store buyers. And it was really like a personal thing for me. Optimize your nutrition this year with Factor, America's number one ready to eat meal service.

Let's talk about how a, how a jeweler, an independent jewelry brand is built and, and it manages to grow because jewelry is a very different business than fashion. Like you sell, if you're a young fashion brand, now you can sell your stuff online and whatever. And you'd have, if you're selling direct to the consumer, you have to make the product upfront. You can take out these, they're not bridge loans, but these sort of loans from people to pay for the production. This is all fashion. And, and with stores, you typically just sell it to the store and they pay you half upfront and then they pay you the rest. Jewelry is different. It's sold often on consignment or, uh, meaning that, so you have to put a lot of capital up to make the product. And then when you actually sell it, a lot of times it's like two directly to the client, you do a lot of trunk shows. Tell me like what the process was to sort of establish the business once you're, once you figured out how you're going to price things. Once the initial important thing was out of the way. Um, I would say I was very fortunate that my business started in the time before consignment was completely the only way to get your jewelry brand out there. So when I first started Barney's place in order, um, they paid me upfront in finance. I literally was like, I have a $14,000 order. I am going to retire. But no, they paid me for my order. Help me finance the next order. I kept things very tight. I always knew that I wanted to have a brand that was, I never wanted to have like a mainstream brand that was sold to everybody because I love making and designing the pieces so much myself. And I love the experience meeting the customer. So I knew that it wasn't going, like my model was to never like open a million wholesale accounts and give a million things on consignment. I wanted to grow very, very slowly, which I think has been my saving grace. So, um, Barney's was my first account. Then we opened, um, Omri is, which is like a really amazing store here at Park Beach and capital, which is a wonderful store in North Carolina. And, um, we started with like those two stores. And then we opened, you know, like basically like almost like two or three stores a year. I mean, we kept it really, really, really tight. And still now we sell to 10 wholesale accounts and we have our two and a half stores to, you know, one in New York, one in Los Angeles and the like store with capital, my dear friend Laura in Brentwood and our website. And I have like very little desire to, I want to grow like within these accounts and nurture those accounts and have amazing outstanding relationships with those accounts. And that's like what, that's how I've grown my distance. If that makes sense. For sure. And so when you had Barney's and capital and Omri's, what a lot of jewelry, and some fashion designers do this too, but I'd say it's more, it's, it's more of the part of the jewelry process. You would go and kind of host an event at these stores, right? And meet clients and teach them about the product. Did that start early on? Do you want to know the funniest thing? When I started doing trunk shows, we were like asking our source to do them and they weren't familiar with doing that at that time, which is so weird now. I mean, not to say that we like create, obviously people have been doing trunk shows, I'm sure for, you know, many, many years that I didn't know about, but I was like, I want to go, I want to meet our clients. I want to help. Like when we opened our LA store, when Melrose Place, I was so, I was like, I'm going to support Barney's. I'm not going to compete with Barney's and take that business away. So clients would walk into my store and I was like, oh, I know you work with Jen at Barney's, we'd call her and be like, we're ringing the sale and through you. So we always were developing this, like people really trusted us. So they wanted to like help grow. But I think people felt really proud to be a part of the growth of our business. And that happened, especially during COVID. I really felt that I hand wrote every single note to anyone who was buying a piece of jewelry, being like you are really individually saving our business. Cause Barney's had just filed bankruptcy and that was a really big hit for our business. And then when COVID happened and everything shut down, I was like, well, it was fun. Well, it lasted. Um, and I just got like, I don't know, I got like all reinvigorated again about, you know, it felt so good that we had these amazing relationships that we had built from the day that we started our business. How did you manage? So the Barney's thing, because you were, you were sort of kind of, what's the word? Well, you were definitely exclusive to Barney's, but also like, I don't have any words anymore. I just don't. I get it. When you think of Barney's jewelry, because Barney's was known for its jewelry department and, but you became sort of, I can't think of the word. It's going to drive me insane. You were the top selling vendor. You were sort of synonymous. I think that's the right one with Barney's jewelry. And so I remember coming in LA to the liquidation and seeing your stuff there because you weren't on consignment. So you didn't, you couldn't buy it back. They could sell it off. And I remember just being like, this is so terrible. She, she did so much for them. And now her stuff is here. Brands and the other retailers and your, your customers, I remember talking about it, they really went to back, back for you during that time, right? They really did. And again, that goes back to developing these relationships. When I first started that, you know, have pulled through, I, I never, like, of course, when in 2008, when the financial crisis was, you know, and Lehman's is like, we're going to put in 50 stores. You're like, oh, I really want, or someone's like, I want to buy your brand or invest in your brand or sell part of your name or any of the, it's very tempting. But I knew, like, I've always had this very strong knowledge of what I wanted my business to look like, and it was never that. So even though the temptation was there, I was like, it would be so nice to have a little extra cash in the bank. I always knew that that was the wrong decision for my brand and the future of my So when the Barney's thing happened, how did you handle it? I had a nervous breakdown first. And then they liquidated my jewelry. It was really personal. You know, that to me was kind of the hardest part. I was really afraid. So Burgdorff's was wanting my jewelry for ever and ever and ever. And I was like, and loyal to Barney's. I knew that telling to Burgdorff's was just like, not going to be the right thing. I really wanted to just like be in one department store. And so when they wanted to invest in me, even towards the end of Barney's, when you knew it was going to completely erupt, they were still like, we'll pick up your line. I was like, now's not the time. Like I kind of need to ride this wave when we can talk about it after. So when Barney's filed, Daniela was all like, may the night go by. Like, listen, we're going to, you know, because I was like, I'm afraid you got, I'm going to, I'm so vulnerable. I'm afraid this is really going to hurt my business. No, no, no, nothing's happening. Nothing's happening. Nothing's happening. It happened. I was super. They liquidated my jewelry, went 80% off. It all sold and like was in a week, which was so lucky. And then Burgdorff's was like, we'll invest in you. And I was so like touched because our jewelry had never gone on sale and never knew what would happen if it had. And we, I was like, I think we should like wait about and let this like, you know, I don't want anybody to be able to be like, oh, I can get it 80% off here. And why am I going to pay retail here? So we waited for that to kind of go away. And then it did. And they picked up my line and it was wonderful. It was totally great at the right time. I felt lucky to have the support. And, and also I assume the fact that jewelry is different, especially really prestigious brands like yours, that there isn't the same sale cycle as it is with fashion. We never let anything go on sale ever. So I didn't know what would happen and what that would look like to our clients. That's what supported us for so long, but luckily it just, it didn't, it didn't affect us in a way that was really detrimental. Thank God. And, and I'm sure the people that got that stuff for 80% off treasure it. You know what? It was a lot of people who weren't able to buy our jewelry, which I always have a hard time with. Like I want my jewelry to be accessible to more people. And it's very expensive to make things in California and on top of it, the price of gold is like a record high. And, you know, so it's, it was in a weird way. It was sort of like a nice mess. It was like a, it was nice that people were able to collect it. You know, my friend Molly has a, her engagement ring is yours. And it was, do you know this story? No, I don't know. Tell me. So she, Molly Creed, and she worked at Vogue, she was a culture writer, culture editor at Vogue, and she loved Lauren Howell's engagement ring. Oh, I didn't. Okay. But I don't know where the story's going, but I do her making her ring. They were adorable. Yes. They're adorable. This like 2010 or something. And I guess she loved Lauren's ring. And you were like, cool, but like you, they're not friends, but you assumed they were friends because they both worked at Vogue. And you were like, you don't want to have the same ring as your friends. So you made one that was like in the same vein, but different. And it's just so beautiful. And one of, we went to dinner on Saturday night and another one of our friends was just like that ring is just so, it's just so gorgeous. But, and, and what Molly was saying was like, I wonder, like at this point, Irene's so big, like, would she be able to do that kind of thing for people? I always want to be able to do that for people. And that's like really so important to me. And that's really what makes me feel like this was such a silly story. But years ago, I had all things. I was getting my makeup done for the CFDA Awards or the CFDA like portrait. Feels like a lifetime ago. Oh my God. That's a when to what year, like 2008 or something. This was later because that went on for like a little while. Oh, yes. I remember this. OK. So I was getting my makeup done and, and this woman came in to do my makeup. But I never met and she was wearing this like long necklace with this like little heart trinket on the bottom. And I was like, I love that. And she was like, oh, my mom gave this to me when I was five. And then she was like, this ring I got when I graduated college. Are these earrings I bought with my first paycheck when I got my first job. And I was like, it's why I make jewelry. It is that is like the most fulfilling, coolest part of my job. And so like hearing that your friend is like, oh, was she too big? That's who would not like I would always love that. Those are the things that I love the most about my business. The thing that I find interesting about the jewelry market is it's made up of most of most jewelry is unbranded. And then there are these like five giant jewelry houses. And then there are a lot of independent brands that don't, that have like a small following, but don't really ever break through. It's slow heart. Culturally, you have broken through. And I think aesthetically, nothing looks like yours. You don't, you know, it doesn't look, it looks like Irene New Earth. And so how have you crafted that? How have you managed to sort of keep going every season and keep building slowly and stay true to what you want to do over 22 years? I say, well, thank you first of all, because that's a really big compliment. And I think for me, I don't know, I guess I've always known what's really important. And I also really enjoy hearing feedback from my clients. So because I travel all the time still, and I still am like really in contact with the women and men who are buying my jewelry. And I see things on them. It's like this constant natural evolution that inspires me to design something different and keep it going. And I don't know. And I like, I never want to be bored. So I'm always like thinking of ways to create it. But I do think I was thinking about this the other day because sorry to segue into this, but I was in London and I was at the River Cafe. And I became friendly with Ruthie Rogers, who owns the River Cafe. And she was telling me about how over the years so many people want to open all these different stores and how she never really felt like that was like the thing. Or all these different restaurants, I'm sorry. And she never really felt like that was the thing for her. And I was looking around thinking like, this is the hardest reservation to get in London. She's been open for almost 40 years. How do you keep that like cool factor? And I was like, I always want to be able to do that. So I've been really fortunate that I've been able to like constantly be inspired, but be inspired by my clients, which is like an unusual, I don't know, most people feel that. Like for me, even though a truncheau isn't like totally glamorous, it's like really glamorous and inspiring to me because I get to see people connect to what I do and see how to make it better. And so I guess it's just been this natural thing. And I also think having the like know with all or the wherewithal to know that I don't want to be everywhere and I want to keep it really tight has like kind of helped me navigate over the years. Does that make any sense? I'm sorry. That's like. For sure. And it's funny, Ruthie has come up on this podcast before. Oh, really? It's the last couple of years, I feel like with the when her that book came out and during COVID, there was just something about it's everything like there's so much attention paid to the look of it. The everything it truly is an aesthetic. If you want to use aesthetic in like the the Gen Z way. And I went there during the Gucci show festivities, they did the American lunch there and I hadn't been probably since pre COVID. But the food, I mean, the food is just incredible. But the food, the attention that is paid to the food is the attention that's paid to the interiors is the attention that's paid to the clients and the way she interacts with people. And I could totally see you being friends with her because that's how you approach your business as well. Exactly. And I really had thought about her business for a very long time after I left, like every time after I leave that restaurant, I'm like, that is just the coolest thing. She like did it to me. That's like the ultimate. Like you have this tight business that consistently grows and people want to be a part of it and people want to talk about it and think about it. And it's creative and inspiring and colorful and delicious. And it's just, I don't know, it's really, she's a force. With your stores, they are so, so you, when did you open Melrose Place like seven years ago or so? Or no, so much longer. I opened it in 2013. Oh, wow. OK, so and you use the same interiors person for both stores? Pam Chimchiri. Yes. Who's a good friend of yours? I, I, I, I, we became good friends through working together. It's really funny. So somebody had introduced us or somebody was like, I think you'd really love her aesthetic. She's wildly talented. And I called her and she put me in touch with her brother, who's I also adore, Ramin, and they were both part of Colombian at the time. Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And they were like, oh, we don't have time. We're not interested. I was like, I was obsessed at the time that Harry Winston campaign with all the animals holding the, I still am obsessed with that. Yeah. That is like such a thing that I think about all the time with our company and like that mixture of whimsical and luxury. And then like how you, it was so unexpected. But remember, it was like the lobster claw, like holding the diamond or the parrot. Anyway, I started sending her all these pictures. And then I started sending her all of these inspiration things of what I wanted the store to feel like and how I wanted there to be a kitchen in the store and how I wanted people to feel comfortable dreaming, thinking about fine jewelry, which is something that like for me, when she was like, go walk through, you know, go walk through your favorite jewelry store. So I basically went to Beverly Hills and I went to all my not favorite jewelry stores. I went to no offense, just not my personal aesthetic, but I went to Harry Winston. And there were men standing outside and tuxedos holding glasses of champagne. And I was like, this, I need to create the opposite of this. Like I never felt comfortable going into like a bulgery, Cartier. I would never walk in and be like, I just want to like look at something and then like dream about it for the next few years until I have enough money to one day buy it. Or I don't know, maybe inspire me to do something else. I would never feel that comfort level. And I wanted people to feel that comfortable in my store. So I was like, let's do a kitchen. I got her all excited. She said, OK, we're taking the project. I was like, I feel great. And we created this like beautiful toolbox, you know, that is so warm and cozy. And I feel like kids feel comfortable coming in. It's like nice to see little girls come in and like ask to try something. You know, it's like such a sweet approachable way to experience fine jewelry, which I wanted to create. Yeah. And I encourage everyone. I assume most of the people listening this are going to be big Irene Newer fans. But for those of you have not seen the stores, they are really magical. It's like you're aesthetic. I'm too on the I feel too much pressure to come up with a good description. But it's like it does feel like you're like walking inside like a gem filled jungle or something. And it's so beautiful and the your sense of color is so incredible. And it's just it feels really good. It like washes. It's like MDMA washing over. But but no drugs. It's it's exactly. But it's you you just have such a specific but also warm and welcome welcoming aesthetic. And thank you. It's it must just be so fun to put those stores together. And then you did New York. That was what 2019 or no, we just opened the year and a half. God, my time my sense of time. No, why did you decide to do like why is having why are having stores? L.A. makes sense. Like you live here, you're working around the city. You have all these clients who I'm sure even Neiman Marcus can't fulfill all their your needs. But like why did it? Why did you want to do a New York store as well? For me, opening this opening of both retail stores was so important because I felt like I would constantly go to these Trump shows and people would be like, oh my God, you're Irene. First of all, your name. I thought you were, you know, like in your 70s or and the jewelry is like somewhat serious. I was like, oh, they don't understand my brand. They don't understand me and my brand. So I was like, oh, it would be so great to be able to create a retail space where people really have a strong feeling of what I want the experience to be. And it's been so important to the growth of our business. I mean, at the beginning when we first opened, I will never forget. I was like, if one wound here designer comes in and not anybody buying jewelry, I'm going to have an enormous breakdown. You know, so I was like, oh, we've been a burning forever. We're going to open the store. It's going to be a huge splash and people were like, it's amazing. Where did this light fixture from? Or like, where did you get these pieces? And I was like, but then as we like cultivated our clientele there and we got to like, I got to hire the people who I wanted to represent my jewelry. They're really a huge, my team is such a huge part of my brand as well. My wholesale team, people in my office, but people who represent me retail. I love that, like my customers wanted on vacation with the girls who work in the store. It's like the most special thing ever. So anyway, it was just really important to tell our story.

Each spring, 23 Pulitzer Prizes are awarded for distinguished journalism, books, drama and music. It was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out it was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th. Follow and listen on Apple Podcasts, the Odyssey app, Spotify or wherever you get your podcast. Your team feels very family-like. I don't know how long Lizzie has been with you for what, like 15 years or something. I mean, she's the best. She's like my very closest girlfriend and we work together. I basically work for her. I don't basically, I worked for her. Let's be real. She is a jam. I mean, she is just so special and also so incredibly organized and such a wonderful people love to work with her. So it feels really good to have her representing me. It feels like you haven't had to compromise. There have been many times where I've been tempted. I'm not really tempted, but people are like, you should make a less, you know, less-surprise point line, make more money, make it so that everyone can buy your jewelry. And for me, it's always been about the artistry of it and also working with the finest materials. And maybe it's about your constitution of someone. There's so much outside pressure in our culture, let alone the fashion and fine jewelry industry or whatever, to be big and to grow quickly and show success. Whereas it sounds like, I mean, from the outside, you look incredibly successful. But again, that took 22 years to. It did. And also, I grew so, so slow and carefully and in such an unsexy way to most people, you know, for me, I was like, if we grow 7% or 3% or, you know, I'm happy with that. And I have control over it. And then when something disastrous comes along, which it's going to, if we're not over, you know, like Barney's, look at what's happening. You read everything that's happening in the luxury world. It's a scary time. And I feel like my business is really buckled up, you know. And I feel, I don't feel incredibly vulnerable because I was so careful. One more business question, then I want to talk about clothes. The consignment versus wholesale or what have you. So just, we, I didn't say this at the top. I'm sure most of the listeners know what consignment is, but it essentially means that you, you make a product upfront and you give it to a store to put in their store. And then they don't pay you for it, but you, when, when it gets sold, you get a bigger percentage of the sale. So it's like almost un-jullery, correct? Not in jullery. Not in jullery. Okay. So tell me how it works in julleries, which is, I didn't know that. So yeah. So in jullery, if you, you consign it and you get the exact same amount of money that you get if they were binding that upfront wholesale. So what? I mean, maybe some people have worked out something. I don't think so though. These stores have been very, no. So yeah, no, it's the exact same margin. Okay. That's too bad. So why, why have they gotten away with it? Because I think so many people have offered to give consignment to get into the stores who can financially do it, that people are like, well, I'm going to take this instead of invest in this. So these, you know, the people who are willing to consign, get their pieces out there, you know, more in a, I guess, they have a little bit more, you know, well, what's the word? I can't think straight now. I don't know. I feel like they have more of a display. They have more of a representation because they're able to, instead of what the store is able to invest in, people are like, give you the whole collection, you can put it out here. My way of going around the hell was by doing trunk shows. So we would have our stores invest because we couldn't afford to do it any other way. And I was like, you know, and my other way around it was like, invest in it. And if something is sitting for a long time, I'll take it back. We'll rework it. We're not going to make you stuck with anything. So like, if you can invest in this much every season, that's going to help me finance like we can come to the trunk shows and we can bring, you know, our bigger piece in this during that time. And that's where we did a lot of those big sales anyway. It was never really that helpful to have them sitting in a case anyway. But the temptation is huge for people starting off now to do things on consignment. And I feel, I think that's a really hard way to start a business. Yeah. Is there a piece looking back? I mean, I'm sure there are many, but that is like really you feel like is a crowning achievement at why? I really loved making the pieces for Ruth and I for the Oscars. Did you watch Presune, Denison? I did. I watched it. I totally enjoyed it. And she's amazing. She's amazing. She's amazing. When Carla had called me, you know, it was also the Oscars are untouchable as a jewelry designer. If you aren't paying somebody to wear your pieces down the road carpet, you don't have a chance. You know, everyone is in a deal. And and then I felt like a lot of the stylist started, you know, we know how this goes. And so Carla calling me to like Ruth was like the one to dress that Oscar. She was nominated. Well, Superstar Stylus. Yes. So, so Carla called me and was like, I'm thinking Pagan princess. I was like, great, great. Just what I do perfectly. Um, so we I went and I got all of these rubies in and we made an amazing Ruby tiara. But it was something that wasn't like totally in my wheelhouse. I don't do like dark cool. I do like feminine and pretty. And so it was really fun to like push myself out of my wheelhouse. And so I made this really amazing like oxidized gold and black diamond and Ruby tiara with earrings and a ring. And I'll never forget Carla. I mean, it cost me so much money. It was such a huge investment for me to go out on the lemon and do this. And very luckily, my stumps under who I work with, who sells rubies was like, I'll give me the rubies I can sign in, give it a whirl and you can unset them. But it's a huge expense to make the piece anyway. And Carla called me and was like, I'm giving you a heads up. I don't know. She'll be wearing it. I was like, no problem. My eyes like torturing talking about it. And anyways, you wore it all down the red carpet and then sold like two days. Later. It was incredible. So it was also wasn't even that it sold. It was just like, it was such a risk for her to do it with me. And there was such a risk for me to make the piece. And then I sort of am not like as inspired by like doing red carpet jewelry, but that was such a fun task. So it was great that it all worked out and then it sold was even more. Yeah. Well, I mean, the thing I find remarkable about you is red carpet. People like to talk a lot about, I get a lot of questions and a lot of requests for coverage about pay to play on the red carpet with these brands paying celebrities to wear things. And jewelry, I did a piece on this probably 10 years ago. That's been happening in jewelry since the 90s. So to be able to be an independent designer, and of course you live in LA, you're connected to Hollywood people. But like even so, the fact that people wear your stuff on a regular basis, like obviously Kamala has been wearing it and forever, but Jill Biden in Vogue. Like the fact that you get these placements and that these people wear your stuff, like it says a lot about obviously Lizzie and her team do a great job. But like your relationships and also the beauty of, because if you are a celebrity and you're nominated for an Oscar, you're going to try to get a deal because you can get a million dollars. Exactly. And know that if they're wearing my jewelry, they're not doing it from the deal and it's because they want to wear it and prefer to wear it. It's amazing. I mean, it's such a, what a fun life. And the other thing that's cool is you go to a lot of these events, which I get excited about because you wear all the dresses I would want to wear. Like you are, if I had to go to red carpet stuff, like your... You come awesome. And the interesting thing is, yeah, because I would definitely fit in anything. But the interesting thing is we don't have, our style is nothing alike. But I just, there's something about the way you dress on the red carpet that I am just always like, oh, I want that one too. I want that one. Like it's just you have an amazing, obviously have incredible taste and aesthetic and design sense, but you have a just great style. How do you approach red carpet dressing for yourself and like what, what kinds of things do you look for? I like to wear something that's a little bit different. And so some, you know, I'm sort of like exhausted by what's on the internet and what you see kind of in the world constantly and fashion. As far as like getting dressed up for red carpet stuff, I'm always like, oh, the pieces that I'd love to wear are probably not either like in my budget or not in my, you know, I can't access on my gas. Like if I was going to borrow something from somebody, I feel like they'd be like, where this, you know, so I'm like, I want to like pick something out that I really love and feel great in. And I met the most amazing, this Christy Rill hang from Builder. I mean, I'm obsessed. She's obsessed worthy. She is really, really amazing. And so we've had fun, like to say that we design dresses together is totally ridiculous because I certainly didn't design them, but I like to like add how I, what, how I feel good and what makes me feel good wearing a piece. Like whether it's like floral things or bows or some added like femininity. With that's like how I can like contribute to the design part. And it's also like she made me this dress. It's these embroidered flowers on linen. And then I did my tropical flowers as buttons down the back. Like we're having so much fun kind of doing these pieces together. It's been great. So she's been like my, my best like not secret because I'm happy to promote her every single place that I can. But having those dresses made has made me feel so beautiful going to those events that you feel so like not beautiful in less than a time, you know, it's really inspiring because so many people, so many celebrities. And now also people who aren't celebrities who are just going to a lot. It just feels like they, they don't. Carla is, is really good at making every person look like a human being and real. And so many people just kind of look like they're in stuff that they were given and it has no connection due to who they are as a person. And your personality comes out so much and it just looks like you're having fun. That's because of her. That was such an amazing connection that a friend of mine introduced me to her. And I was like, oh boy, this is dangerous and also so much fun. What do you wear day to day? So today to describe you have a beautiful white dress on and earrings, big earrings and necklace that I it's a little blurry, but maybe Jade. I can't tell. Turquoise. Turquoise. So, but like a pale, pale-ish green turquoise or? No, they're really turquoise. Turquoise. Yeah. Okay. So like what brands do you favor day to day? Like what in the, cause you are so connected to the fashion industry and that like your friends with a lot of people in the industry, you feel, I'd say very few jewelry designers are like that, that they're so embedded in, in, you're a real fashion person too. Like what do you wear day to day? What are some of the brands you're excited about? I mean, here I tell you what I would like to wear every day, what I'm wearing today, which is not what I wear every day. I'm obsessed with Gabriella Harris, which is like a funny different thing for me because before I was so into color and pattern and I don't know if it's my age or like just the times now, but I want to wear like a really beautifully made dress that's just like simple and pretty and you know, you like feel good. On a date like during that during the daytime, like not, you know, it feels appropriate. So I love her clothing. I'm recently back to color and pattern. I'm obsessed with Coco Brandelini's line. This Coco doubt. I don't even know it. It's quite great. You have to look it up online, but she does all these really amazing like vintage fabric skirts and these like mixed fabric tops. And it's really like whimsical and feels like really humbriant. I want to do a trunk show with her in my store. Oh, yeah. Oh, wow. This is like. Yeah. It's right. Good. I know. And it's so me. I love it. So fun. Yeah. It's by appointment only also, which makes it even more fun. I know. And then I reached out on Instagram and was like, I love all of these pieces. And then ended up getting me too many pieces, but I really. And then I met her. I was just at a little party when I was in Greece. I mean, that sounds so with silly and fabulous and it was, but not my typical life. And she was seated across from me and I was like, I am obsessed with. I was like, I want to do something in my store. I was like, I've never offered that to anybody. She was probably like, right, you offered it to me in 10 seconds or meeting me. But anyway, I really love her pieces. What do you think of the fashion industry and like the state of the industry right now? I think it's a little sad right now. And, you know, it feels really uncertain. I feel like usually during an election year, it tends to feel this way. But I also think that the pandemic really confuses everybody. And I'm like a little it's one of those times where it feels like good to be a little outsider and be in the, you know, a fine jeweler and not making clothing. You feel a little scary, right? Irene, I'm looking at this woman's Instagram. I'm obsessed with this stuff. It's really interesting because there's just something about your sense of color that I feel very connected to, even though, as you know, I like, I don't ever wear prints. I don't ever wear florals. I wear like pretty masculine clothes. But like there's this, it looks like it's like a space. It's a planet. It's like on the trees on the moon and pink and purple. It like reminds me of childhood or something. I am obsessed with it. And also it's like not everywhere. And so that feels really exciting. You know, it's just, it's I am. I wore, I have this really gorgeous like chartreuse skirt with like bright flowers and like these brass buttons with this like crazy brown and white top. It was totally out of this world. And I wore it and I think I was stopped like literally 20 times on the street. People were like, what are you wearing? I was like, either people think I look totally insane. But it was really beautiful. You always inspire me. What's what's next for you? What's the next your next big project? It's really just kind of more of the same, like developing my collection and hoping that our business grows just a little bit this year, which is like an extra challenge in the time where the luxury business is not doing so great and riding horses a lot. That's my next thing. You know, I have a horse tattoo. You jittle. Really? Where? I know, I don't want to talk about it, but I'll show it to you the next time I see you. I have ridden a horse twice. Oh, my God, that's even better. I was really obsessed with horse motifs when I was like in college, because it was around right after Chloe Stella. And I was really obsessed with that. And then my friends, like my crew in college, we were the ponies. And I got it's so embarrassing. It's so I can't wear a very, very, I can't wear a strapless dress for the rest of my life. And every time I do, people are like, what? You're like, you're a horse. But it's actually a really pretty. Like I like that I still like the tattoo. I just am embarrassed by it. But every time I see you on it, I loved your town and country cover with the horse. Also, the fact that I was on the cover of town and country was so funny to me and so amazing. That was such a special surprise. I didn't know. It's awesome. Stelina is a genius and she has the same sensibility and humor and she doesn't take stuff. She takes the right thing seriously like you. And I thought it was brilliant. I hope you get it framed or like you should get a painting of it. I was like, you're kidding. That was like a once in a lifetime that will never happen again. It was very cool. I mean, I just never was that moment to die. I'm so in love with riding horses. It has been the best midlife crisis of all time. And it's actually been really healthy for my business because I become obsessive. And I will like email people at all hours of the night and text, you know, like I'm always thinking of things. And I also think that I wasn't great. I think it was helpful to grind my business, but I wasn't really great at letting people in my company do what they do best. I wanted to control everything because I was so concerned about like taking the right steps. And I think there was a point where that started to become a fail in my business. And so strangely becoming obsessed with horses and like taking a little step away and letting people really do what they do best on my team. And it's been like really helpful and growing our business. You know, can I come watch you ride sometime? Yes, come to the desert. OK, I will. And I have the cutest little place there from that town and country. Oh, yeah. Come stay there. I will. I'm in. We'll do it. We'll do it before the end of the year. Great. I'll be there in November and December. Irene, you're the best. Congrats on everything. I love that you exist. Thank you. I love that you exist. Yeah, we need to get together. Yes, for sure. We'll not just talk. Soon. Yes. Yeah. OK, thank you. Fashion People is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck, hosted by Lauren Sherman. That's me.
