And today on the show, we've got not one but two special guests. First up is Simeon Siegel, a managing director at BMO Capital Markets. And he's my go-to retail analyst when it comes to American fashion companies. We discussed the FTC suing tapestry and Capri over their potential $8.5 billion merger. And why it seems kind of silly that they're being sued. And then we do a little recon on Ralph Lauren, who had a runway show in New York last night. Then for part two, journalist Marissa Meltzer joins me to cover Glossier founder Emily Weiss' giant real estate purchase. Marissa wrote a book on Glossier and Emily, so there's no one better to unpack this. And then for the rumor of the week, we'll dig into all things Head East Lamont and Celine. Let's get started. Simeon, welcome to the show. So happy to be here. I would say finally, but I got some of the early run over here. Aren't you excited that you're on before Luca Solca? Nothing could make me more excited. Luca doesn't even know the competition that he and I have for your interest. I am high low as fashion is and Luca's my high and you are my low. I don't know how to take that, but I guess you know what? At least I'm one of the two. In the best possible way. So Luca is going to be on in a couple of weeks if we can catch him. He's a very busy man, but I am so happy to have you here. And as everyone who reads line she knows, I rely on Simeon quite a bit for market intelligence especially about these bigger brands in the U S. You're the expert. So thank you for being here. The first thing I wanted to discuss with you is this tapestry capri deal, this $8.5 billion deal for these two companies to merge together. They are mostly accessible luxury. They want to be in real luxury. Tapestry owns coach Kate Spade, New York. It's not just called Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman. Capri owns Michael Kors, Versace, Jimmy Chu. They were going to join together to take on LVMH in carrying a little bit. It would have been the second biggest quote unquote luxury provider of handbags in the U S. If they merged and on Monday, the FTC announced that they were going to sue the companies for this merger and try to block it. Which can you explain to me why the FTC is doing this? So by the way, you just said that quote unquote, which normally will say in passing is actually critical. And so I'm not going to pretend to be a lawyer. I'm not going to pretend to be an FTC expert. I don't know that any of us are, but we're learning and what the definitions here apparently are what are so critical. And so if there's a market called accessible luxury, that's very different than there's a market called luxury. I think at the end of the day, listen, the primary purpose is I understand it. If we take politics aside, as the FTC is supposed to try and help the consumer and suppose trying to help people. I mean, I think that's the idea. And so the question here is, is there by grouping these entities together, does that hurt the consumer in terms of their pricing? So will prices automatically go up? And on the other hand, there's another conversation of does it help? Does it hurt from an employer perspective? Dude, does the company become so large that their leverage is now just dwarfing any individual person's ability to actually make a living? I think that it is fairly recent that all of a sudden you can see from the stock price that the fears have grown and they were growing into the lawsuit. So now the question is what happens from here. And there's different precedent, but I think primarily, right, a lot of this is going to be tied, as I understand it, down to the definition of how big is the market and what happens in terms of competition. I think you and I know, I'm not making a legal opinion here, but I think you and I know there's a lot of competition in our world. And so to merge two entities, does that remove competition? Do prices all of a sudden skyrocket? It's a pretty discretionary item. So the pricing part of it, I was talking to a very, very, very senior level executive who lives in the world of these companies. And the way that they explained it to me was the concern is really in the outlet stores. So Coach and Michael Kors are giant brands that we all know and love in the US. Love, maybe not love, but a lot of us love it. And they have a huge presence in the off price of the outlet stores, discount market. And essentially what this person said was what they could do is, you know, now they're one company, there's less competition for these, I don't know, $190 handbags that you buy at the Michael Kors outlet store or whatever. They could bump them up to 195. And because they sell so many of them, this person estimated that the combined entity would be 70 to 90% of the off price in that price range of that like accessible luxury that gets marked down to $100 to $200 or whatever. And they said, if you bumped it up by five bucks a bag, you could make an extra. They were saying that the synergies when the deal happened that it was going to be like $200 million in cost savings. But the reality is there could be a surplus of hundreds of millions of dollars if they could bump out the price a little bit. I don't think that they would do that because the consumer is so driven by discounting in that channel in particular that I don't think it would be worth it for them. The combined profits that they'd be making on those products anyway. I don't even know if they would bother bumping it up, but I guess they could bump it up two bucks and nobody would notice. But so Lauren, so I was going to say, before you asked me a question, I was going to ask you a question. I was going to say, how long was the description you just had to make? The $200 in an outlet, in off price, in that category for that consumer, okay, so what? At the end of the day, I think we need to decide is that a market? Is the outlet channel for accessible luxury handbags that trade 100 to 300, that rhyme with runway product that make people believe, you know, like, is that the market that you're not supposed to own? I mean, every company wants to own some market. And if it's narrow enough, it's not called a monopoly. Right? It's called their audience. I listen again, these are all opinions. This is not, I can be completely wrong here and this will ultimately be a legal decision. But I think if you and I were to think about it, I think one, by the way, $5 on 190, I mean, hopefully these companies are getting low single digit revenue increases from price. You know what I mean? Like that, that's hopefully they have as a brand, you and I want to believe that you have some semblance of pricing power, even if you're in that bucket. Hopefully old Navy, if they chose to, could raise prices low single digits. There's got to be some. They never will, but sure. So I think that you and I shouldn't be scared and the consumer should tolerate a low single digit price increase for a handbag. Now, $5 on a carton of milk is a totally different proposition. And so this is being aligned with a grosser deal right now and thinking through, OK, like so, which as we think about what we want to break, I think there's different conversations, but I do think your point, even if what I just said is wholly irrelevant at the end of the day, the consumer will decide. Again, it's not a carton of milk. They don't need to buy another handbag, much to their dismay. Right. This is a product that the company needs to convince you to part your dollars with. And that means it has to be product. It has to be quality. It has to be experience. It has to be value. It has to be all the things you and I always talk about simply saying, oh, man, there's no more competitors. So now the prices are going to become Chanel prices is silly. And I think that is going to be the question. I agree. And the whole thing, it's just hilarious to me. What the FTC should be looking out for is that consumers are spending all this money on these stupid handbags. They should be glad that that it's going to be a little more expensive or whatever. I did for me. We've entered into the realm of like normative morals here. I like it. For me, people need to buy food because they need to survive. They don't need handbags to survive. And why is this the FTC's business? I find it very silly. I've gone through many of these bustings over the last few years. Generally, this one is the most surprising to me. The one other point on it, though, that is interesting is this combined employee thing because it altogether, they'll employ 30,000 people. That being said, a lot of those people work retail. And so when you think of the fashion industry, people will say the fashion industry has gazillion people working for them. Sure. But most of those people work retail. So those are retail jobs. And yes, that that is a challenge. If you work in coach corporate and you're a designer and you make 225,000 dollars a year. And Michael Kors tries to hire you. There might be they might be able to only give you a ten thousand dollar raise, etc. There's it means less competition. But if you work retail, first of all, there is minimum wage requirements. And I'm not saying they're they're good, but there are again, like this one, I feel like has a little more of an interesting argument. But but to use your point before Lauren, like to go back and say, if they're really looking out for the benefit of the employee, are we more worried about this entity being together? Or are we more worried about what AI could do to displace everything else? Right? Like I just as I think you raised an interesting point a little bit ago where we're talking about like at the end of the day, what is the goal? And it might not be that the FTC's goal is to actually try and help. It might be on the highest level, maybe to try and knock out individual wins that that can help. And maybe that's why this is what they have to focus on. But I think your point, it just raises such great questions where if we're trying to solve for a problem, there are dramatically greater risks to this very specific issue than this entity coming together. And frankly, I think we like to think, listen, you and I know really well that the US consumer is overly resilient, sometimes not that healthily so. We overspend. We're just not that smart when it comes to our spending. And by the same token, we're overly resilient when it comes to thinking about creating new companies and creating new brands. And it's obviously hard. But if there truly is this vacuum, I'm going to guess someone's going to try and step up into it. I know that's very easy said and done. And it's an oversimplification, but simply believe. Listen, this isn't Amazon, right? Like this combined entity, there's plenty of forces that are dramatically stronger. And so then growing in, I just don't think all of a sudden every employee realizes now, oh, we wake up tomorrow and there's no benefit. We have no control and life is over. Speaking of a dramatically stronger entity, let's talk about one of Tapestry Capri's biggest, most resilient, most impressive, most independent competitors, Ralph Lauren. I was wondering where we were going. I wrote about this quickly in my piece on Tapestry Capri that if it doesn't work, John Idol, who's the CEO of Capri and would really like one final deal, he's a great deal maker. He's made money off of cores. He's made me, he's very successful guy. He could reverse engineer some sort of merger. One person said, you know, the ideal, it will never happen because it's an independent company. They don't want Capri, but Ralph Lauren. Last night, I went to the Ralph Lauren show at 650 Madison and then had dinner at the Polo Bar. We are recording this before that. So I cannot give you a description of the scene, but what I can say is that the clothes look very Ralph Lauren because the clothes never surprise you at a Ralph Lauren show. They're fabulous. There is definitely a sequined dress. There is definitely a tuxedo and it looks beautiful and love Ralph. I'm sure he looked great. I hope he wore his plaid shirt from Walmart. I'll update this when I tweet out and when I, when I promote this episode, what Ralph was wearing because his look is always the best of the night. And you and I over the years have talked a lot about Ralph Lauren. Can you give us a sort of big picture of this company? It's independent. They've spent the last seven years remaking itself, recalibrating for the modern market and trying to establish the business so that it is not so reliant on discounting like a lot of its competitors are so that the consumer feels as emotional and romantic about it as they did 40 years ago or now how, I guess it's over 50 years since it was the 2019 was the 50th anniversary. Do you have your coffee table book? You have your 50th? I actually don't, but I did go to the 50th anniversary in Central Park. Did you go also? I have my book. Oh, nice. Well, I went and it was the most one of the most fabulous fashion shows I've ever been to. It was incredible. And the clothes also looked amazing and they had a kind of a different stylist than they usually use that night or mixed it up a bit more. And it was truly remarkable. That night, I remember so many moments. It was really incredible. Anyway, let's talk about what's happening now. Ralph got a new CEO, probably what six years ago now, Patrice Louvet, and they have embarked on this turnaround or reinvigoration or whatever you want to call it. Can you briefly talk about how the business is doing right now as they stage this fabulous show in their headquarters or their former headquarters? Right? Ralph did. Ralph, the company and Ralph, the person did something truly special in bringing not just Patrice, but also one of the most impressive retail leaders that I know, Jay Nielsen, who had been at coach, had effectively done a really nice job turning around the business as a coach and then was brought in as the CFO to Ralph. Ralph, you and I know this. We talk about it all the time. I'm sure Luca could tell it better than I can, but we're in the business of storytelling. Right? At the end of the day, retail is a storytelling business. No one does that better than Ralph Lauren to the consumer. What also happened was they started telling that story really well to the media and to investors. And the story became we went too far. We're going to shrink to grow. We're going to elevate the brand. And we're just going to regain all that brand elevation that was what made Ralph. Ralph. And so that was a process that honestly, you and I talked a lot about for basically the entirety of retail over the last three, four years during COVID. They had started this beforehand. And so to Ralph's credit, they fixed the business without the benefit of a pandemic. And I say that half sarcastically. But so you watched from it, from what the world that I look at, from a revenue and an operating margin perspective, you watch them improve this business. You watch them bring inventories under control. You watch them start to remove and reduce promotions without the FTC saying it was a problem because they did it organically. And so at the end of the day, they accomplished something really special and they did it before the pandemic. I think the question though becomes now where we go from here. Because what the company continues to tell us is that they continue to raise price. And again, that's why I said it as a joke, which may or may not land, but I'm okay with jokes that don't land. But at the end of the day, like we were talking before about how big of a deal it is, it's all about pricing, right? And you brought up this low single digit raise and that's going to completely put that right. I mean, that's the, that may or may not torpedo an entire M&A deal. And yet what's the one thing a company wants to do more than anything? Raise price. Right? That is what we try to figure out a way to do and to do it sustainably and to do it healthily and to do it without sacrificing enough units. And so Ralph, the company has been telling us that they have been able to continue to raise price. The only question I have to ask, and this might be going too far down a rabbit hole, is we're not trained to look at price for price sake. We're trained to think about price as a measure of brand elevation, which raises your profitability. And so what is interesting is for the last two years, Ralph Lauren, the company has actually not outperformed on their gross margin, right? If I'm looking at that as the measure of brand elevation. And gross margin is the profit without taking out a bunch of other stuff. Gross margin is just thinking at the highest level, gross margin is how much money am I making on this specific polisher or sweater? Cool. It's not accounting for rent. It's not accounting for marketing. It's not accounting for any of the other costs that run a business. It's just saying, what are people willing to pay for the product and how much did it cost me to make it? And so it's for me, despite all the conversations to the contrary of broken brands, alive brands, all those things to me, I think very simply, the size of a company's business is determined by its revenues, how much people are buying. That tells me a customer buying. So revenues tell me how big a business is. Gross margin is what tells me how valuable a business is. It tells me how much are people willing to spend above it. And so I think right now, what we need to figure out is, okay, has Ralph Lauren already elevated their brand? And now this increased price, it's just not driving that margin, despite the fact that last night in the future, you saw a beautifully Ralph showing where I'm sure everyone stood up for a standing ovation. I really try not to stand up at those things, but you're correct. So from the consumer perspective, I think they've done a great job at fixing it in the consumer's eye. It's not perfect, but then a lot of the marketing still looks a little, you know, it looks like Ralph from along. But in Polo in particular, which is sort of the sub brand, they have done an incredible job with the product. I think the Lauren brand also, which is sold really mass, they've done a good job with. And the interesting thing about Polo is it has become an object of desire for the dime square crowd, meaning young people who live downtown in New York. I kind of didn't believe it. And then I was walking the Silver Lake reservoir a couple of weeks ago, and I see all these girls in Polo caps and the vintage Polo thing and it becoming big again is real. And I think that the marketing and advertising they're doing around women's Polo right now is fabulous. They're doing different types of, oh, I hate this word. Activation. So they did a big collaboration, a big event with this magazine called Omegirls that is cool and young and downtown. And, you know, a lot of my friends are into Ralph again, their Polo ID bag is killing it. It's very cute. Like from a consumer perspective, I think they have done a good job at bringing it back to feeling pure and feeling like that Disneyland of fashion brand, but also still capturing my dad who's buying it at Marshals or whatever. He still loves Polo since he's loved it since 1977 or whatever. So I think they've done a good job. But when you say the gross margin hasn't really moved, why do you think that is? I think what you just alluded to is what makes Ralph's job so hard. Right. Like if you're a small luxury business, small, relatively speaking, you know who you're speaking to, you get to stay true to yourself. And it's much easier again, you you shuttered at activation, I'll shutter and say authentic, right? Like it's much easier to just be who you want to be. Then it's a question of figuring out, OK, am I am I in Lauren's favor or not? Right. Is she writing a good review or not? Like that's what you have to focus on. But you don't have to you don't have to appeal to a Marshall's crowd and a New York crowd. That's a very hard thing to do because Ralph Lauren does six billion dollars, six and a half billion dollars of revenue. It's a huge, huge business and you cannot do that. Right. Later on to make sure that that we hit all sides like your your full high low. At some point, you and I will do one of these on Nike and we'll talk about how Nike is both the world, one of the world's best luxury businesses and yet sells 50 billion dollars, so sells to everyone. We're going to do an hour episode on Nike. Nike is a book that I'll never write, but we got to do it. Never write yet. I'm learning about growth mindset. But but I think like that's the issue, right? So at the end of the day, what they need to do is that business that you just describe what makes you happy, what will make your readers excited and will make me excited, won't drive a huge portion of revenues. And when you're this large, you need to. And so that balance, like figuring out how do I both market to the people that are going to read the story and invest in the story to make them feel elevated while still making sure that I can sell a lot of polo shirts. That's a very tricky balance. And I think that, again, to their credit, Jane Patrice Ralph did a really nice job before the pandemic is only so far you can go if you want to stay that large. Simeon, thank you so much for being here. Fashion is a schmatte business. Always. I appreciate you. Thank you for having me. This was great. And I cannot wait to hear how last night went.

I didn't think it would happen this fast, but then there was breaking news in the Glossier world this week. And I just knew you had to be here. There's a lot to say. Where'd we begin? So you are obviously the expert on Glossier. Rachel Struegatz, who is my partner at Puck that covers beauty, also writes a lot about Glossier, the business. And she did a great story a few weeks ago when they started to get into the M&A game like every other beauty brand this year. It's totally insane. Rachel, you're here with us in spirit. She doesn't like doing podcasts, so I will occasionally tease her on here for abandoning me. But we love you, Rachel. We love you. You're the best. Marissa, this was an emergency I had to have you on because yesterday morning, this article came out in the real deal that Emily Weiss, the founder of Glossier, the subject of a book you wrote called Glossier. So you wrote this epic book that I absolutely loved about the business of Glossier, which is one of the most important brands, consumer brands to come out of culture and then come out of America over the last 10 years. It's a beauty brand, but fashion brands have really followed its trajectory as well. Emily is the founder. She was the previous CEO. You tracked her rise and stumble, I would say. I wouldn't call it a fall, but rise, stumble. So this news, I don't know if you're still doing incremental updates on the Glossier world for your personal amusement, but this news. How could I ever stop? Are you going to mention the fact that Emily Weiss has reportedly bought a $22 million brownstone in Brooklyn Heights? I would have the paperback wasn't already printed, which comes out in June, just a plug. But no, I absolutely would have because I find this fascinating on many levels, and I don't know which one to start. I think maybe we start in just saying that she seems to be thriving and doing great financially. This seems like an indicator that she is bullish on her future. And I think if anyone is wondering if an acquisition is maybe in the works, this seems like it would be at least doesn't counter any of that sort of conjecture. $22 million is a significant amount of money. And I also think it says a lot about culturally where money and power is. It used to be that I think in some of the earlier days when I lived in Brooklyn, Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams made headlines for buying a really expensive double brownstone in Boron Hill. And then it was like Matt Damon. And now it's Emily Weiss who is in her late 30s and founded the sort of era defining beauty company. I imagine that her partner who is in finance, maybe out of financial role, who knows? I don't know how they split up their money. And so yeah, I mean, the fact that this is such an expensive deal and that it's coming from her and that it's making headlines just says a lot about our continued interest in Glossier, right? For sure. And it apparently it's the second most expensive home in Brooklyn, which maybe I've been living in LA too long, but I thought, it doesn't sound that crazy to me. But. Oh my God, that is crazy. You've been living in LA. People buy 30. I go to $15 million homes, $30 million homes all the time. It's just it's a part of the life here. But that's the point is that she chose Brooklyn. And I think that there's something to discuss there. You and I are both former residents of Brooklyn. And she didn't decide to buy a townhouse on the Upper East Side where I recently moved and where apparently JLo and Ben Affleck were looking, I think on like East 74th Street or something like that. And so, you know, I think that the fact that she wanted to live in Brooklyn also says a lot about what Brooklyn represents who's moving there. She's definitely going to send her daughter and any of her future children to St. Anne's, right? No, no, no, she's going to do Packer. We did you was this all your text? This is all my text. All about. Absolutely. All the text chains. Yeah, me too. It's she's Packer. No, no, no, I beg. She made soap out of her own breast milk and posted it to Instagram. She's sending her to St. Anne. I don't know. I just think her personality is more Packer. But we'll see. You know, and this is a great, this will be a great bet and debate that we can catch in on it a few years. I agree. And I do think it's really interesting. One text I got was like, did she make that much money off the secondary? And I don't think I think you're right that we can't assume that this is all coming from Glossier, but it is, it is an indication that she is, is confident about her future. And, and that is what your book says the most. It's that Emily Weiss is a confident person who will succeed no matter what. And that is why she's a compelling business leader in the beauty industry and beyond. And Reed Maris' book, it's great. Congrats to Emily. I'm very impressed. And especially because she got the real deal, the real deal article. But it's a, it'll be a fascinating journey. And I can't wait to see how she, they just did a huge renovation on it. And apparently you can't find any images of it online. I had investigative reporters looking into this and so many images have been scraped. Someone who had access to MLS looked and couldn't find anything. So it is a really interesting thing. And she's, she's a power player. She's a business leader and she just bought in Brooklyn Heights. So it's going to be fun. I bet we're going to get a lot of like textile shopping updates. I think she's frequently goes to Salone. She obviously spends a lot of time in Copenhagen. I think we're going to get a lot of peek into the interior process. Also, she majored in studio art. So I think she's going to go really deep with that because I think she has time and passion on her hands. We wish her the best in her, in her home improvement endeavors. When we come back, we will talk about the rumor of the week, which is all about Hedy Slumman and Celine.

I'm still here with Marissa Meltzer, author of Glossy book about Glossier. It's very fun chatting about Emily with you. But now we need to move to Heddy, another person who needs no introduction. But the big thing that came out this week, and I've been writing about this for several weeks now, is that Heddy Slamann, who is currently the creative director of Celine. He's one of the remaining superstar designers. He designed St. Laurent. He used to design De Or Home. He is very, very famous. He is the reason that you wore skinny jeans for far too long. Curse him. He was negotiating his contract. I heard it was up in June. It seems like he is maybe probably possibly leaving Celine. And the question is, where is he going and who is replacing him? As for who may be replacing him, I also heard this week from people very closely connected to LVMH that this guy, Michael Ryder, who designs polo women's clothing at Ralph Lauren, he's been there for about six years. But previous to that was the kind of a right hand of Phoebe Filo at Old Celine is in. I heard from people close to LVMH that he is in. WWD ran a story that same day that said they were talking to him. And the Ralph Lauren people that I asked had no feedback for me. He is a beloved character at Ralph Lauren. He's done an incredible job at polo. And I went to the show last night. It was not, it was the main collection, but we're pre-taping this. So I can't tell you if people were chatting about it, but I assume it'll be on everybody's lips. And he's really beloved there. He's made a lot of headway at a company that is very set in their ways. And it's difficult to make change. And so I think they'll do a lot to try to keep him. And as for Celine, if he was going there, it's, I think, an amazing thing for consumers like you and me, Marissa. I think it's high time for a Celine reset, right? I guess you and I, we should say that we are not heady girls. Like, no, but that's not our personal style. We admire it. I have, I've already talked about them on this podcast, but I do have a pair of Saint Laurent boots, plain Chelsea boots. I respect the game. Like we are not, we are old Celine. We are old Celine ladies. We are, yeah, we are loyalists. Yeah. And the thing about Michael is he knows the Phoebe playbook. He understands deep commercialism. And he, he has established a set of rules around amazing denim, amazing jackets, amazing trenches, simple preppy bourgeois 1970s gear. And Michael, what Michael could do is sort of take it in a little bit of a new direction, but still use all of the components. So I think it could be really interesting. Right. That kind of like gammy and rocker direction that Hedy does wherever he goes. I think one place he will not go is, you know, I am a virginie apologist, which is, I think, a rare place to be in. Virginie Viard, who is the current creative director, was one of Karl Lagerfeld's deputies and was elevated when he died. And many people do not like her clothes. I buy and wear a great deal of her design. I was just wearing her Mary Janes. I currently have on a pair of her gold knit pants. I find her clothes very wearable, but it's, you know, it's actually not about me. But I also think her clothes are wearable and people are buying the ready wear, not to mention the bags and everything else that support Chanel. And I don't think the workheimers are looking to replace her. I tend to agree. I think I have some very, very close sources that have dealt with the workheimers for years and generally agree. They do know it's not a long term solution, but they also are not going to rush into anything. The interesting thing about Hedy is he was, Karl Lagerfeld was a Hedy superfan. He wore Dior jeans for years and I do think he'd do a really good job. Do you think he'd do a good job? I think he would do a Hedy and I think that Chanel has too much of a matronly client base for Hedy to just do Hedy. I think that needs to change, but I also think Hedy doing Hedy is more subtle and specific than we give him credit for. So if you look at say, you look at the like the beautiful loafers, the first saline collection looked like Saint Laurent and everybody was like, Bluh, why did he do this? It's terrible. And that was sort of a revenge to caring. I think the second collection was What I Wanted, which was Celine is a bougie brand. It was not a fancy brand. I mean, it was fancy, but not that fancy from the 1970s and Phoebe made it her thing. And she also definitely tapped into that bourgeois thing, but like he really nailed that. And I think with Chanel or Dior, honestly, to me, Dior is the ideal brand for him because you are right that no, I honestly think he if he does not sign with them for another three years, he is going to chill out and take a break and he'll do something eventually, maybe eventually Chanel or something. But the thing about Dior is that he is the perfect person to design Dior. He knows how to take archival product and modernize it and make it look cool. But the problem is he wants to own every single part of the image. Dior is not going to do that. So no, Dior is a machine that has a creative director for beauty, a creative director for its kids line. But like as good as I think it would be and as much as I think that that house needs a creative reset, I love Maria Grazia. She's very good. I think it would be bad PR to get rid of her. It would be, but I think she wants my instinct is she's ready. I think Kim Jones probably ready to move on. And also, it's not performing the way it once was. LVMH said that in the last earnings. So they are going to have to make a change performing the way it once was. No, no. So they are going to have to make a change at some point, but he would be able to do it. Where would you like Hedy to go? I want him to go to Dior. Where do you think he'll go? I think he won't go anywhere. I think he will sit and chill and hang out in Santro pay. He will leave. He will take black and white photos of young up and coming after in Santro pay. He's been hanging out a lot in Santro pay. He's going to hang out there. He's 55. He could do it again in five years. I think he probably just needs a break. He's done remarkable things for them. He set them up and he doesn't need them. I want him to go to Gucci. I like that. Wouldn't that be good? That would be sexy. It would be because 70s, lewish, rich, hippie is such a good like Gucci aesthetic. And I think he could really bridge the sort of McKaylee Tom Ford gap. He's kind of halfway in between in some way and can create product. Let's check back in three years on that. Rosa, thank you so much for being here. I'm sure you'll be back very soon. I can't wait.
