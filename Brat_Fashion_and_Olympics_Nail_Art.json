And today with me on the show, we have Essence content director Steph Yacca, live from Copeland, Copenhagen Fashion Week. We're talking Olympian style possible replacements for Peter Hawkins at Tom Ford. And yes, brat summer. Let's get started. Hey everyone, hope you're having a good week. Things have finally slowed down a bit, which is never a good thing to say out loud. Line sheet of course is as packed as ever yesterday, Monday, August 5th. I shared some updates on the Nike situation, which I plan to follow closely from here on out. I got a lot of great feedback from you all and did some more reporting and we'll continue to do so. So let's, let's keep on that. I also had a couple updates on the Peter Hawkins exit from Tom Ford, more reporting on what actually went down there and a few other bits and bobs. Today on the show, Steph and I are going to get into brat summer, Peter, Tom Ford and who might be replacing him and a bunch of other fun little items. One popular request I had from the line sheet Puck readership was to cover Blake Lively's hair care line. So I also got into that on Monday. I'd say the TDLR is, I don't know, if the product's good, it'll do well. I like Blake Lively's hair. I think she looks really pretty and I know on the internet people have been talking about how dry it is, but I don't know. Everybody's hair is dry. If you have thick coarse hair and you dye it, it's going to be dry. Maybe I just, I feel, I feel connected to Blake Lively in this way. But anyway, there's always a way to spin a celebrity story into a business story. It always all goes back to money. So hope you enjoy that. Semi requests as August, I have a little more time to dig into things that I normally wouldn't. So while everybody in Europe is on vacation, so keep the comments coming and I am sure that the next time we speak, there will be more news and some unexpected bomb dropped because that always happens. Okay, let's get going with Steph. Steph Yacca, welcome back to Fashion People. Thank you. I'm so excited to be back. So you're in Copenhagen already. I am. I've been to a couple of presentations and shows so far today. It's just the first day of Copenhagen Fashion Week and there's much more to come. So how long have you been going? Because I'm sure it's always been a thing, but it really has only been a thing the last, like what, five or six years? Yes. So I've actually never been to Copenhagen before or to Copenhagen Fashion Week. And I think, like you're saying, I really felt like it is becoming a thing or felt like it's getting a little bit closer to being an integral fashion capital. So I gave up my August vacation to take the journey to Copenhagen and it's totally worth it so far. Look, Copenhagen in August, the weather is probably gorgeous. It's what, like 75 degrees or something. And honestly, a lot better than New York where it's 90 degrees and 100% humidity. You know, this week in LA, it's been in the 90s, which in LA, dry heat. I can totally handle, but it's been really humid the last couple of days and I'm not, I'm not a happy person. Also, I woke up this morning, it was 68 degrees. Usually it's in like the 50s or 60s. It's too, it's getting too hot. But I can't believe you've never been to Copenhagen. It's such a cool city. There's so, I mean, it's great food scene, really beautiful. Everyone is good looking and dressed as well. It's fun. Yeah, it's been such a delight. Yesterday, I just walked around the city and took pictures of everyone's outfits because people just dress amazingly. So the interesting about this fashion week is most of our listeners know this, but for the uninitiated, there are four major fashion weeks. New York, London, Milan, Paris and New York and London are like very minimal at this point anyway, but those are the four major ones that all the buyers and retailers and editors go to. But then there are these like secondary fashion weeks. There's one in Sydney. There's, I've been to Singapore fashion week. There's obviously Tokyo fashion week, which is pretty bigger or Seoul fashion week, which is pretty big. But the Copenhagen one, probably what 10 years ago, all the designers, they have like a really interesting niche design community with brands that have become pretty big, like people obviously know Ghani and some Philip A.K. I don't know if that's, if that's actually from Denmark or from another Scandinavian, if it's Stockholm. We'll fact check that. But or we won't, and you can just look it up yourself. But anyway, there are all these like cool brands, Acne is, Acne is Stockholm, right? Stockholm. Yeah. But like from Scandinavia, they all show at Copenhagen fashion week and they also are like very into sustainability there. So there's also this like social responsibility element to it, but it's become a thing where they just invited the right set of people early on, the right influencers, the right editors. And, and at these kind of secondary fashion weeks, they'll often pay for editors to come on a press trip or what have you. So it's become like, and it's in August, which is such a nice time. If you want to attack on a European vacation, if you're from the States or from Asia or something, it makes it much easier. But it's, I'm very impressed by how much attention it gets and how interested people are in it. What made you decide to go this time? I had a lot of phone call from everyone who went last time, but also there's a lot of designers on the schedule here that I really just wanted to see their clothes in person. We carry Nicholas scope guard at essence. And I think he's just incredible. Make some of the biggest, strangest, most glamorous dresses and accessories. Earlier today, I was at Seoul Hans Daughtier. I'm going to pronounce every name wrong. So if you are everything, yeah, if you are Danish and you hear this, just try not to cringe, but I was at Seoul Hans Daughtier. He's actually Icelandic. Um, and I think I had seen her collection when she graduated from central St. Markens, but it's just a really, she has a very sort of drape be sort of culty, fairy kind of energy. It was very interesting to see that. And then there are like the more established brands like Saxpots or Gany who's not on the schedule this week, but sort of the Gany presence looms large throughout Copenhagen. I've seen a lot of Gany sweatshirts and a new, a new ish menswear brand called MF pen that's sort of in the vein of like an R legacy or an orally, which every menswear buyer that I know is really hyped about MF pen. So I think it's an interesting city to see fashion because it is both niche and indie, but very commercially viable. You know, every brand here that's, you know, unique or independent or emerging or alternative also makes really great clothes that are easy to wear. And I think a lot of other cities struggle in their fashion week is sort of an either or like, especially in New York and London, like you were saying earlier. There are the super commercial brands and the mega brands. And then there are the super independent, super crafty brands. And in Copenhagen, it really feels like that's one in the same, which is kind of nice to see that harmony throughout. It's a great way to synthesize it. When you think of brands from Scandinavia, it's a lot of brands that are sold at multi brand retailers, department stores, concept stores at menswear in particular, like Norse projects. You mentioned our legacy. My husband for years exclusively wore Norse projects. And yes, he and he is married to me, but it's not like I was like, here's this brand, he just found it by shopping on like n.com or whatever, or at some little shop in Paris. But it's, it is, you're exactly right that the brands, a lot of them, Norse is a funny one. I don't know if they do it. They probably don't do any sort of presentation, just probably show room appointments, but they're a funny one because they made this really nice button down shirt called the Anton for years. And then they just stopped making it. And, and my husband like has obviously emailed with them millions of times asking them annoying things. And they're just like, we don't want to make it anymore. And it's like, this is your best selling thing. He has so many of them that he's bought on sale and all that. So he'll be fine for the rest of his life. But did they just stop making them? They have no interest. It's like, I want to be viable, that I want to be distributed and I want people to wear it, but I also have no ambition to be bought by LVMH or whatever. Mm hmm. It's like when a beauty brand cancels their best lipstick. Oh, so stupid. So silly. What else are you excited to see? There's a Cecily Bonson and Asics event tomorrow. I saw Cecily this morning wearing her Asics. I think it's a, you know, she has a really interesting brand because it's very girly, but very sporty. You know, maybe in the same vein as like a Sandy Liang. Um, like I said, I'm really excited to see Nicholas's show. Rater this week, Shanae O'Dwyer from London is coming to CEPHFW to do a show here. Um, so I'm excited to see her. I think she's a really amazing designer that even in the sort of independent scene of London Fashion Week, never really got her flowers. Nicholas is such a crowded schedule of independent brands in London that, you know, I hope having a show here in Copenhagen really gives her the space to breathe because she makes really beautiful size, inclusive clothes, really great tailoring. She's like one of the only designers who is so considerate of the body of all sizes. You know, she's not just showing like larger bodies or smaller bodies and stretchy fabrics. Like she's really tailoring clothes to suit everybody and everybody tight. And I have a lot of respect for her for that. And I think, you know, within the fashion community, like real heads, no shanae, but I think it's sort of time for her brand to get a little more recognition. So I hope that Copenhagen fashion, the right set of influencers, the right people there helps more people see what she's doing. She's also just lovely, a lovely person. Yeah, I think the next phase of sort of wearable fashion and including size, inclusive fashion is this idea. Like I think Caroline Vito in London does this too, but it's not about the thing that's tough for me. And you just did this sale in New York with all these other cool girls that are like, it was basically a clothing sale for people who aren't a size zero is the best way to describe it. Like it was all different sizes. And the thing that bothers me about most of the size, inclusive conversation in fashion is it's like, that's what it's all about. I remember when I worked at Lucky Magazine, they wanted to do like a plus size page and I was like, no, don't do that because that just makes like, it's just is like, just act like it's a part of life instead of acting like it's this separate thing that you need to put a box around or market in a specific way. And I get why the first kind of wave of this had to be specifically marketed as size inclusive because then otherwise people wouldn't really notice. But now I think it should just be a part of sort of the way designers think. And so people like Sinead or Caroline, I don't know, is it Caroline? I don't know, whatever. I can't pronounce anything. So everyone just know I'm terrible at pronunciation. But yeah, so that's really interesting. I'm excited to see it and I'm glad that you're right. I think that's a good place for her. So the thing is people are really paying attention to Copenhagen Fashion Week, but they're not, it's not in the mix of everything else. So there's time, like people have a little time right now to take a look. So maybe it will be really good for her. I'll report back. Thank you. So you're so close to Paris, are you going to stop off for the end of the Olympics? You know, this morning I had breakfast with one of my colleagues, Caitlyn, and she's going to the Olympics with her dad right after this. And I have to say, like the twinge of FOMO really struck me. I wish I was, but I'm actually, I'm going home, but I've been watching from my iPhone. It's time for spring cleaning. We're not talking about your closet. We're talking about your health.

Obviously, taking place in Paris, LVMH being the sponsor. Fashion is at the center of it in a way that it never, never really has been in the modern world, at least. And I was watching the segment on Peacock. The other day I said Paramount Plus, but it was Peacock. About like fashion's involvement in the Olympics. And they interviewed the people from the Leotard company that supplies the who keep pitching me. I don't know if you keep getting pressure releases from them too. I don't, but I would love to. They supply the gymnastics team. It's called, I think it's called GK, something that's based in Pennsylvania. But anyway, the CEO and the CEO of the Leotard company, they're the ones that are but anyway, the CEO and their head of marketing was were interviewed. And then they talked to someone from Nike, who obviously they really dominate in terms of sponsorship and uniforms and things. But has has anything, obviously the opening ceremonies was really, you know, spectacular. And there were tons of cool outfits, but has there have there been any uniforms or just like personal style of any of the athletes that have stood out to you in the recent weeks? Like most people, I'm totally obsessed with Yeji Kim, who is a Korean sharpshooter. She looks like she stepped out of a magazine editorial. She liked the black bomber jacket, the sharp shooting sunglasses with the square and the circle lenses. I'm not really sure how those were the backwards cap. She looks like the coolest person alive to me. I think like as a fashion person, that was the fashion moment that I think has the most potential to translate outside of the stadium. She actually just looks cool. On the flip side, I think what's been really interesting as a lay bystander to the Olympics and also like all of the sports stories that in my past job, you know, you know, you would have been getting pitched constantly like this brand's debuting a sneaker or this brand's dressing this athlete, this person made the uniforms, blah, blah, blah. Like I sort of avoided that whole pre Olympics press cycle is I think the personal style moments that really have stood out at the Olympics so far are actually about style and not about brands. Like people are talking about Chicago Richardson's nail art, which is fabulous and Jordan on the gymnastics team also has amazing nails and Simone Biles doing her makeup with Fenty Beauty and even like Yeji Kim's sharp shooting outfit. It's just like these people feel inherently cool and are finding a way to merge sport and their personal style. That can't really be branded. Like I just feel like there was such a phase from maybe 2010 to 2020 where any sporting event of a sporting brand was moving closer to fashion by doing collaborations with fashion brands that still had this mentality that's like the average person aspires to be like an athlete, like LeBron James is wearing these sneakers so can you or Shaqari Richardson is wearing this uniform and so can you. And I actually think it's going the other way where it's athletes want to feel fashionable and cool and chic the way that a normal person does and this kind of like reverse marketing that's like, hey, you on the couch, Jordan, you want to wear this like spandex body suit, feel so backwards. It's like the opposite like, hey, you amazing athlete, don't you want to look like a cool girl at Copenhagen Fashion Week? Like I bet there's some amazing scrunchies that I can find in this city that would look fabulous on gymnasts or runners or whatever. Totally. I was thinking about all the nail art across the athletes and how it's interesting that that's allowed. There's a lot of personal expression that is allowed. Why it wouldn't be, I don't know, but it just feels like something that would be more regulated because you don't want distractions or whatever. And it's really cool. There's so much nail art and long nails and inspiration there. Yeah. I think that Yeji is, she just looks like a cool girl and also her makeup looks great. Like it's exactly what you're talking about. Like her lipstick looks good. Yeah. Whatever lip color that is, please tell us. I have a feeling it's her natural lip color with just like a little bit of tint or something. It's great, but she looks so good and it is something like she looks like a movie star. It's not, I feel like the runner up is the best. There was a piece in some, I don't know, Time magazine or something about how tiny the runners uniforms have gotten, but like it also, they feel very fashion. They, it feels the same thing with tennis. Like Coco Gough, she just, she looks so cool. And it's, it's, it doesn't really matter that the uniform is what everyone else is wearing. It's more about like, it's the same thing with red carpet dressing where people, like the same dress could be worn by five different celebrities. And one is going to look the best in it because they have personal style and know how to express it. But it's, it's really fun. It's been nice to see that sort of pop out. And oh, by the way, the gymnastics uniforms, the leotards are by GK Elite. Noted. It feels like if you are, if you're listening to this and you're a fashion brand, now's the time for your GK Elite collab. Yes. Especially because body suits are a real thing that people actually wear now. But yeah, I think that you're exactly right. And it kind of speaks to that individualism and the way the culture is so fragmented. And we all have our own ideas on what is cool or what is interesting. And it's coming out with these athletes. But it's fun. It's fun to watch. It's been really nice. I hadn't watched the Olympics in years. And for some reason, this time I've gotten back into it, probably has to do with it being in Paris. And so, and just, you know, see a lot of our friends are there with Omega. Shout out Omega. Yeah. Shout out Omega. We love you. Invite Steph next time. I don't take press trips, but it is, yeah, it's interesting because it's just like so much more. And it probably is like all of our friends who are journalists who live in Paris are there. And so there's just more we notice. I have so many friends who have been going to stuff. Yeah. It feels a little bit closer to the American experience. My friend, Ratu Morzuconi, who is the men's Washington critic at Le Figaro, went to the opening ceremony. And like all of my group chats were like, Matu, what do you see? Matu, what does it look like from where you are? It's really fun to be able to sort of, I feel like the Olympics are just another indie fashion week that one of your friends is at or someone you know is posting from. Yeah. I hope that all of these people write a bunch of stuff on the way out, kind of reflecting on it because it is, it's a really special moment for fashion becoming like actually the pinnacle of pop culture. Now, do you think a lot of brands may be held back on dressing athletes or collaborating with brands because of the LVMH sponsorship of the Olympics? I do. I think obviously Nike and Hermes and Ralph Lauren are three brands that have a big presence because they're just so embedded in sport anyway. So it has less to do with being a luxury or fashion brand and more about having some kind of connection to sport. So you'll see them, especially Nike everywhere. And there's a, there was a great Twitter thread that I linked to in line to you a couple of days ago about Adidas, I think sponsored in 2012. And it was essentially about how Nike sort of overwhelmed them anyway. And, and just were really clever about it. But yeah, I mean, the luxury brands mostly everyone I talked to who didn't work at LVMH was like, I'm not getting involved in this for many reasons. One was because of the dominance in the shows and the sponsorship that was so much money. I mean, they, they deserve it. But the other thing is that LVMH already owns a lot of sort of the outside advertising in Paris or rents that space, occupies that space over long periods of time. So it just didn't feel like what was the point of sort of getting involved. And then on top of it, a lot of the stores have been closed or are hard to get to. So you couldn't even ship product in. They were worried about actually having product available. So I think in that way, a friend of mine who's there, message, I had sent her a list of vintage stores, and this is obviously a little different, but they're all closed for all of August, which is part of Paris anyway. It's just nothing, no one's there. And so I think the idea of trying to like get in and get involved and, and get something out of it. It just didn't seem worthwhile for most of the luxury brands. I would say it's interesting like Jacomous's Nike collaboration launched right, right before. They were smart to get it out ahead of time, but that collaboration is just a good collaboration. It's one of the best ones Nike has done in the last few years. I also really love this, this new Stoosey sneakers that they just released. But, and, and Nike's, Nike's like dominance and skate. That sport is really interesting. And I was actually watching it the other day and, and they were all wearing Nike stuff. But yeah, I think, I think for the other luxury brands, it's just like, what's the point? Because, and, and that sort of, it kind of is big picture reflects on what has happened in the industry, which is that like, you can't really compete with LVMH anymore. You have to be, you have to vie for something different. And so it'll be interesting in Milan where caring is really dominant. They have Gucci, they have, and that's in 2026, I think winter though, right? So, but still Gucci, they have Zenia, they have, which means Tom Brown, which there's Montclair, there's, uh, Bo-Tega, Bo-Tega. So it's, it's a much more, they're, for LVMH, they have Fendi there, but that's really their biggest brand there. So it's, it's much more of a caring, but also just independent. There are tons of really big independent fashion companies in Armani who outfits the, the opening ceremony. There's Brunello, there's just like a lot of opportunity. I would love to see the Prada Sport snowboarding outfits come back from a lot in the winter. I think that we will see a lot. And they're actually building something right by the Prada and, and also Bo-Tega offices right now. Well, if there was a gold medal for eating sandwiches at Barley chain before the Prada show, I would win that. So I've never eaten any food there. Just had the espresso. Oh, it's good. I love it. It's very cute. The little pastry. Recommend. Okay. So I asked you, we always love to have a, I'm going to reveal the behind the scenes of, of fashion people today. When I sent you the lineup for today, I, I love to have a little celebrity content in here because you know, it's, it just mixes things up. And I mentioned Blake Lively's red, insane red carpet looks. Shout out to Dauphinette though. She's been wearing them a lot and I'm really happy for her. I love, I love that designer and she's, she tries really hard and she has the stuff is great. So Blake's been wearing that all over town. I hope she sold many dresses. But anyway, I was like, let's talk about it. And you said, actually, I'd really like to talk about Brat Summer and Charlie XCX, which Steph, I'm sorry, I have completely opted out of Brat Summer. I have opted up. So, but let's talk about it. You wanted to talk about Charlie's looks at her birthday party. And I will give my feedback as a very old lady in a minute, whose spiritual age is 60. I think the thing that's been so fun about Charlie XCX Summer is that she really is wearing the independent brands. Like the fallacy that like to be a pop star, you have to only wear mega brands and you have to be front row in all these fashion shows. It's just not true anymore. Like in her most recent video for gas, she's wearing All In, which is so fab, like another scandy brand based between Norway, Sweden, Paris. She wore Colleen All In. You couldn't just be based in Norway, let me tell you. I just went there. No way. Really? I'm desperate to go, but we'll save that for the after the show. Not to, I don't, Oslo. I was like, I don't even remember the name of the city. I wouldn't go to Oslo if I were you. That's my advice. Okay. Anyway, we digress. But she wore Colleen All In for her boiler room set in Ibiza. We love Colleen All In. Obsessed. So cool. I think I'm just very fascinated by, I mean, I love Bratt, the album. I love the art direction, the graphic design. I love Charlie. But I think I'm fascinated by her version of pop stardom that's so unique to herself. There's really like, you can't measure her success on anyone else's yardstick because she's just dressing like herself. She's wearing her sunglasses in every interview. She's carrying her purse sometimes when she's on stage. And I guess it goes back to maybe the overarching speed of this episode, which is like, there's really never been a better time to have really good personal style and just be flexing it however you can. Like the playbook for how to get dressed and what you should be wearing is thrown out the window. And I think Charlie and her stylist, Chris Horan, do an amazing job just making her look like the most fabulous, cool version of herself. When she gets, I mean, she's extremely famous already, but like, how, what does that mean for her when it comes to fashion collaborations and sponsorships and things like that? Because you're talking, she doesn't really, she, it doesn't sound like she's done a big deal to wear one like like lively. For instance, I have no idea if she's just wearing this stuff because she likes it or she did some partnership with them, but she's been wearing a lot of Versace. So that's, and that might just be she's friends with someone who works there. I truly have no idea. But what does that, what do you think that means for Charlie? It's something that comes up with Taylor Swift a lot because she is not she does wear designer stuff, but it's very particular and very specific to her and doesn't feel like it's any sort of collaboration with the brand. It just seems to be what she likes. What do you think when it, when Charlie's like building out her business, is there a brand that you would love to see her partner with in some way? I thought she looked fabulous in Marnie at the Met Gala. And I saw her at the Balenciaga tour show this past June and she has worked with J.W. Anderson. And I saw her at the Corez show. But I think maybe as a musician, it's a little cooler to just be yourself and be outside of fashion and do your collabs and get that those deals elsewhere. You know, when Charlie released merch earlier this summer, it's very lo-fi. Like baby teas, print it with the word brad or now gene bottles that say brad. It wasn't like some high concept like art directed. I mean, there's very intentional art direction and graphic design behind the album and the ethos, but it didn't feel like a thing. In the fashion sense, and I almost feel like for celebrities nowadays, it's probably, I'm going to do air quotes around this because I actually don't know. This is just a hunch, but easier to make money or get deals outside of fashion. Like shouldn't Charlie have underwear for guests or shouldn't she be selling little tiny bags to bring to her concerts or, you know, maybe sunglasses or, I don't know, just like other lifestyle products that make you feel like part of her world in a way that like fashion feels exclusionary. And I think there's sort of a new genre of pop star like Charlie or Chapel Row and who invoke a more human experience. You know, it's not this like I'm so rich and I'm so fabulous and don't you want to be me? It's more like I'm a real person and I'm still fabulous. But I myself, which I think if at its core, like the Taylor Swift paradigm is like, yeah, she is a billionaire, but her whole presence is just I'm a normal girl. And that's why she doesn't partner with fashion brands. And I sort of think she's maybe like a little bit smarter for it. Not to say that I wouldn't love to see her, you know, serving. Yeah. And it is also like lively as along those lines too. What I wrote in line sheet was like, she's real in like the most Hollywood unreal way, which is that like, yes, she's Hollywood and polished and all that, but she also just obviously is doing exactly what she wants to do. And you can feel that and it grosses people out. And sometimes it like turns people off and sometimes it, but it endears you as well. And I think that like, I hate this word, but authenticity. Is missing in so much of our culture that when, when someone does it, it really hits. I would say just looking at that Marnie dress that Charlie wore to the Met Gala, just a little aside on Marnie, I think those clothes look better on real people than they do in the runway shows. Every Marnie runway show, I'm like, okay, fine. Like, cool, cool, cool ideas, cool technique. I like that guy. He's, he seems cool. And then every, all the stuff that was at the Met Gala that was his, he had a few dresses, they just looked amazing. They look really good on, on real bodies. And it's an interesting just a position because his stuff is so craft based and craft focused that it's, it's interesting that on someone like her, it just really pops. Yeah. Yeah. I think Marnie does such a successful job making people look really special in the clothes. There's a couple of Marnie dresses from many, many seasons ago, maybe fall 2020. They're like hand painted with sort of like a white slip coming out of the bottom that I just think about those all the time. Each spring, 23 Pulitzer Prizes are released.

My name is Nicole Carroll and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out. It was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th. Follow and listen on Apple Podcasts, the Odyssey app, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcast. It's time for spring cleaning.

We have one more topic, the rumor of the week. But really quickly, the your mention of baby doll teas, they're really the ringer tea baby doll. It always reminds me they're really back. Like the whole milk fed, Sophia Coppola, our favorite Sophia. That era of the 90s is like really resonating right now. It always reminds me of Gloria Baum. Do you remember who is now at, I think, at Tori Birch, but she was the fashion director at Teen Vogue. And before that, she worked at Vogue. And I remember hearing stories about when she worked at Vogue and her like coming in and floral skirts and baby doll teas. And it like, she's a big reason they became a thing. For our rumor of the week, I have a piece on Monday kind of digging further into Peter Hawking's exit at Tom Ford, which is something that like, I thought it would be one and done, but there was just a lot of interesting intrigue around why he ended up leaving. But now the world is very focused on who is going to replace him. And I really don't have any. I heard Hader Ackerman or Hider Ackerman, who knows, from some people. And that like, what I heard for sure from people close to the company was that it wasn't like the biggest name in the world, but they were really excited about the person. And they had asked, like, they had asked a lot of people, so, or had talked to a lot of people. It's a better way to put it. Given that we have no idea, and maybe by the time this comes out, they will have announced, I highly doubt it. Who would you be interested in seeing at Tom Ford? So I was actually looking at the Peter Hawking's clothes and I stand by, I think they're perfectly fine, but the problem may be that they were perfectly fine. They weren't exciting enough. I think there were a lot of other things going on there too. But like, from just like, from a fashion fan perspective, what would you love to see them do with that brand? It's a really interesting situation because I think in everyone's minds, when they think of Tom Ford, they think of Gucci. And that is the version of Tom Ford and his creativity that is so embedded in fashion people's memories, but also in pop culture right now. Like, the Gucci looks are still getting pulled from the archive and worn by celebrities and it grows alike. And so I think like the hardest question to answer is really like, what is the spirit of the Tom Ford brand on its own is like really gorgeous gowns. I mean, think about what Gwena Paltrow wore to the Oscars, that little cape. Often, but it's very minimal and it's not super sexy. And so, you know, I do think Haider would be an amazing choice. I mean, I'm a big Haider fan. It would be great for Timothy Chalamet. And Kylie Jenner, I guess. But I also think like Robi, someone like Ricardo Tishi coming back and, you know, he is one of the best couturiers of his time. I mean, some of those Givenchy couture lookbooks that were shot in the salon front and back are just stunning. And he also, you know, knows his way around tailoring and makes sort of sexy, ready to wear in a way that always feels very contemporary. So maybe that's my guess. But also like Tom maybe just come back. I don't know. I mean, I'm sure Tom Ford is living the dream, retired, making movies, but I think he will not come back. I wonder if it does feel like he's so young. So it feels like, oh, maybe he he ducked out a little too early. But I wonder if he would come back to consult on the brand itself and brand marketing and brand imagery and have a designer there. But I don't know. I think he's probably, I don't know him well enough, but he seems like too resolved of a human being to go back and maybe would start something new instead in five years or something. But also that last show, the song they played, it was like, I think it's called is that all there is or something. It just felt like it was the end. Like he's like, I'm out. And I don't know. I don't know if he's, he seems like a very secure person in the way that a lot of like helmet laying and even RAF closing his fashion line. Like there are, there's a certain personality of designer Margella who could, who decided, you know what, I'm done and I'm going to, but then there's Jill Sander who comes back every 15 years or what have you. But yeah, I think it's interesting. The Ricardo thing, when I had Fabiola Barracasa on, we talked about the, because she wore Givenchy Ricardo couture for her wedding and we talked about those look books. And that's a really fun idea. I do think, I think you're right. A lot of what Tom referenced in the early days of the women's wear, Tom Ford women's wear was Jeffrey Bean. Like I remember there were like very direct references that he was open about. And you're right that it's like much more minimal and he was never, he's never been a print person, but there isn't, it's not all about being sex, sexy. I think it's like sensuality and both Ricardo Tishi and Haider have that. And so I hope they choose someone who, who has a personality that is not Tom Ford's personality, but that can like bring that sensuality to it. Because I think that's something that's missing in a lot of fashion now is like just beautiful sensual clothes. They're also standardized. Or it's just like something that's, it's also something missing in culture generally. Maybe also let's put one more name in the ring. Maybe Boucherad Gerard. Oh. Oh, I do. Yeah. I love those collections. They were beautiful. I don't know if that will happen. Okay. But I like the idea and I think a woman is an intro. Oh, you know, I mean the other, the other one is like a clear weight color. It's, she could do it. And I think she worked for him at some point, right? It feels like that lineage. Who wants maybe at Gucci? We'll check the Wikipedia. But also it would be great to have someone like I was thinking of, I never, I can definitely can't pronounce his name right, but Antonin from at Lean. Like someone like that who is young and is, I think probably close to being ready to have, having a big job at one of these houses, like who designs young sexy clothes, but that would benefit from having like the resources, the fabric resources alone at somewhere like Zanya could be really interesting. Or there are a million menswear designers who could do it. I always love when menswear designers start designing women's. It's, it really works for me. But yeah, there's, I think I like this Ricardo Tishi idea. And he seems like he's in a good place. There was just an FT article where he was like, I'm in a good place. The pull quote. No, I also think like fashion in general feels like it's sort of doubling back to that 2010s moment where it ready to wear had a sort of like sporty, funky feel that it was like clothes were normal, but not so normal. They were like a little subversive. And that all feels very Ricardo. Like I think whether he gets another job at a mega brand or finally the long his own brand or fashion projects, it gets like we're all maybe like ready for him to set back into our lives in a bigger way. I agree. It was very exciting when Heider got that Canada goose job and he was suddenly back in in the world and at the Dries show. I mean, Heider is one of the best dressed people in the whole world. Like I think he should be forced to work all the time just so that we can see him at fashion shows and events because he really is amazing. I agree. Stefano Pilotti is also an interesting one. Yes. Another one of the best dressed people of all time. Yeah. Yes. I think he used to work at Zenia and. Yes. True. I'm not sure how that ended. I would need to look back on it, but that may be and a blocker on that, but he's fabulous and could totally do it as well. And they have, I mean, they have the same around. I love when designers, there's like a connection. That's why I want the Sarah Burton Givenchy thing to happen because it would be like a full circle situation. But yeah, who knows? We will see all this stuff will happen, not one we want it to. So get ready. Labor Day weekend designer announcements. Here we come. Exactly. Stef, enjoy the rest of your week. Thank you. It's going to be great. Thanks. And I'm sure we'll talk really soon. Yeah. Thanks for having me on again. Thanks for being here.
