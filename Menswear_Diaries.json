Aaron Levine, welcome to Fashion People. Hey, thanks, Lauren. Appreciate it. How are you? I'm doing great. I'm doing great. I'm not here in your town for a couple of days. And I'm glad that we have the opportunity to sit down and talk for a minute. I know. It's very exciting. So first question we ask on Friday mornings, what do you have for breakfast? I actually just strolled up the street with my buddy John Tetsu's here. And there's like a spot. It's like we walked up up to sunset. I think it's like sunshine, sunspots. I don't know what it is. Sunspots. This place is famous, I think. Is it? It's like, OK, cool. I want to go bleed cash for an acai bowl. Oh, yeah. But you don't feel bad about doing it because I feel pretty good after eating it. So I'm like, OK, trade off. You like acai bowls. Call me basic. Pure sugar. Pure sugar. Look, look. Look, you're telling me I could do worse. That's all I'm saying. I know you're healthy living. I know you're healthy living. I'm just saying it's not Captain Crunch, right? So I'm trying. So let's not let's not berate me for just trying. At least let me have the thin veneer of trying. You know, I've never met this John Tetsu character. I know the lore of John Tetsu. And also his wife is real cool, too. A lot of my friends are into his wife and they're like a cool couple, and they do a lot of cool stuff. But I would like to meet him someday. He's very under the radar. He doesn't there's not like a lot of photos of him or he doesn't like self promote a lot, right? He's a ghost and it's great. And he's the best. He's lovely, great. Just a great dude. Yeah. Yeah, someone needs to profile. Maybe Jacob should profile him for the times. There you go. He would be very annoyed, I bet. I'm going to tell Jacob to do it. Let's put the wheels in motion. Let's do it. So you were at the GQ Men of the Year party last night. You are a sort of a man of the year. This is this next question. How was it? How was it? It was lovely. Did you dress up in the cowboy stuff? Because it was like cowboy glamour themed. I had some friends who were I was advising on their looks. You know, I, as I was getting ready for this, right? It's like cowboy country kind of thing, right? Like my mom's from Kerr-Winsville, Pennsylvania, right? And my pat pat was country, right? His kind of country was like he had an old beat up Bronco that was stitched together with like metal plates he made. He had a hula dance on the dashboard, a tennis goal long cut in the cup, you know, like in like a plastic makeshift cup holder. It was like it's like county fairs, funnel cakes, you know, putting pennies on railroad tracks. Like it's like genuine country. And it's like if I put myself in a situation where I dress up and my pat pat was like, yo, what are you wearing right now? I can't wear it. So I just wore one of the suits that we make for the brand. And I wore like a Western shirt that we make for the brand. I wanted to pay respect to Wilt Welch and the team and all the effort they put into the theme. But I have to do it in a way that I feel comfortable or else. Yeah. I just feel out of my skin. I think that's right. And I also, most people at that party, I went a couple of years ago, like, are just looking at the celebrities. No one's looking at me, Lauren. It doesn't matter. A couple of people are looking at you. No, no, no. I'm like, I'm just like creeping around there. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Very exciting that you had clothes from your own thing to wear. It was amazing. Arturo, who's one of my partners and Josh, who's my other partner, like they made some gear for us and we wore it. And it was great. It worked. I felt great in it. So I'm just stoked. Let's rewind for one second. We're going to get into your new brand and how you got to your new brand. But where in Pennsylvania is your mom from? My mom is from Kirwan'sville, Pennsylvania. It's in Clearfield County. It's like bottom middle. You know, it's funny. People refer to it in a couple of ways. One is about an hour north of state college where Penn State is. Yeah. You know I'm from Pittsburgh. Yeah. So my dad's from Pittsburgh. My dad's from the middle of the. Yeah. Right. Squirrel Hill, that kind of area. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And my mom is from about an hour north of state college. They call it Johnstown, Altoona, Dubois area. OK. You know? Got it. Yes. It's a wild place over there. It's really wild. I mean, the first time I ever got drunk was in state college, Pennsylvania. How about that? Happy Valley. Yeah. I mean, it was it just felt like as a 16 year old who was desperate not to get in trouble. It was like, I'll go up to Penn State with my friend's older sister and get completely wrecked. I'll drive six hours into the middle of Pennsylvania. She gets like, we used to just go up for the weekend because I would not drink at home because I was like, I cannot do anything that could mean I didn't get to leave here when I turn 18. But it felt very safe to get wrecked in state college, Pennsylvania, because like literally there's 40,000 people just drunk all the time. It just feels like a natural progression. Yes. So it's interesting because on my notes for you, your talking points, I actually wrote mom's sick ass job. So your mom, you grew up in Virginia though, right? Yeah, I grew up in a suburb of DC called Annandale, which is like Fairfax, Nova, right? Yeah. But my mom, my dad worked for the government and my mom is a calligrapher. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Did she do stuff for magazines or something like she has? So she would do all sorts of stuff. I don't want to do her disservice and I don't want to like give her any improper titles. But I believe at one point she was president of the National Calligrapher's Guild. She would go teach classes in like Wales and the UK and take classes in Wales and study with like these amazingly talented people. And it was obviously like a very niche community. I remember being in the 80s, people coming over to our house and us having events because the National Calligrapher's Guild was based in DC. And I remember there being like this room full of these calligraphers. It reminds me of like our community, right? Yeah. The way that she would speak so highly of these other people who were so talented and there was like, they would push each other to be better. And I remember my mom being like, oh, the way Marta does this or the way Tina does this or the way Yehyn does this, it's like exceptional, you know? And I would look at her and I'm like, my, you're exceptional, you know, like you're exceptional. And at one point I remember her having a show in Smithsonian and it was like a very big deal. I think I was a senior in high school. And I remember it's like how proud I was of her and am of her. She's amazing. I love her. She's incredible. So is my dad. Do you think her interest in design is what pushed you into fashion and were you interested in fashion growing up? Yes. Like I wouldn't say that I'm interested in like fashion, right? I'm interested in like in clothes. Like that's what I always liked when I was a kid, you know, and I don't want to like sound lowbrow by saying, by calling it clothing or whatever as opposed to fashion. But like, if you look at me like I'm a pretty boring guy, right? Like I don't like wear crazy stuff. I just long, I love stuff, you know? Yeah. Right. Snooze. I'm the same way. Snooze, you know, but I do, if I said that I didn't truly love it, that would be a lie because I absolutely love it, but I just love it in like my own way. That's that's not really like a fashion way. It's just like I like they like I'm a floor worker. Like I lay a bunch of stuff out on the floor and I like to look at it together. And I like it's like right. Like I make a comparison to music a lot, right? Because I can't play music, but I wish I could. But when I look at this stuff and I look at it coming together. Across different classifications by that, I mean like shirts and sweaters and outerwear and trousers and all these things. And I lay them all on the floor in like different colors and textures and fabrics and yarns and all these things. The way that it comes together in my brain. Is like it's a it's like I would imagine it would be to write a song. You know, like it's just I get a feeling from it. That's so emotional that I don't want to sound like cheesy or boring or whatever. But I get this feeling from it that I love and it brings me joy. And I understand it's very niche. And I understand the things that I see. Other people are like, what are you talking about? But that's kind of just the way that it is. You know, were you good at balancing equations in chemistry class? So because I think I have a theory that a lot of people who think the way you think and understand how to make something look quote unquote right, which you do. And I think it's just a very particular ability to like calibrate things. Are we're good at balancing equations? It's that's I love this, by the way, I love this question, right? Because so I went to school. College, I got into college for for an honors honors, biochemistry program, I tested into it, right? Oh, wow. Interesting. Here's the thing. I was terrible at it. Like, like if you looked at like because of the way my brain works, because I'm ADD. And it's funny because I that term is thrown around so frequently. And when people are distracted, it's like, I'm ADD, I'm ADD. But there are aspects tied to your whole situation when you are to ADD. It's like you can look at something, you can have a conversation about it. You can understand the process. But it's almost like there's a short circuit in the attention span and connecting the dots when it comes to it. So although I tested into this stuff, if I had to sit through a class for an entire semester and then take an exam on it and then read a book on organic chemistry, I was just like, this is not happening. Right. This is not happening. And and I feel like like what I think I wanted to be at that point was I wanted to be an orthopedic surgeon because I had like some issues with my ankle and I had an interaction with orthopedic surgeon when I was like 15 years old. I was like, oh, man, I like people a lot. And I and I like this interaction. And I think if I could just skip right to the hands on component of taking people apart and putting them together like Legos, I think it would be cool. However, the arithmetic to get there was just like, yo, you're done. This is not going to happen. Being interested in clothes in Virginia in the nineties as a teenager, like, because I didn't know any guys who were interested in clothes and except for gay guys, to be honest, like they weren't out. But like my friend, Brad McElrath, who became a designer at Dick's Sporting Goods, definitely was gay when we were in high school. Right. But like didn't talk about it or whatever. But like, was that like how did your friends know you were into clothes? Like, I guess that there were that crew of guys who were really into like hacky sack. They were obviously, you know, the, you were, I bet you were one of these people. You they really into the dead and fish and all that. I'm super into the dead, more dead than fish. And I never really was a hacky sacker. So, you know, that crew, I do know that they were more interested in clothes, but it wasn't. They weren't like, I'm interested in clothes. It was just like a look they all wear. They were all skateboarders, too. Like, yeah. It's like interesting and like, okay, I'm going to, I'm going to assign myself to a tribe, by the way, that I dress or whatever. Right. Yes. Yeah. Did you have that or no? So that's how it was in high school, right? It was like, and I see it with my girls now, too. You know, there were different groups of people, but at that time, late 80s, early 90s in Northern Virginia, it was like very bro culture, right? Yeah. Yeah. So it was like, Bridges, great outdoors, county seat, Levi Silver tab, you know, these were the stores. And then Fairfax Surf Shop. Yeah. And then I would always love shopping at like Army Navy stores. And then I would actually look at like vintage stores. You just had to like look for it. And then I liked combining all of it together that created a certain thing. Yeah. And I would put it together differently, but I would wear kind of the same stuff. And I would maybe experiment like a little bit more than like my friends did. But yeah, they always knew and I always got made fun of for it. And I came in second for best dressed in high school. Wow. Yeah. I was very upset I didn't get best dressed. But I just didn't think I don't think they got it. Like I was buying stuff from the J crew catalog, which was like very exotic in Pittsburgh. Totally. There wasn't a J crew when I was growing up. There is one there now, but there wasn't when I was growing up and like, remember I got tweed cargo pants. Yes. Very advanced. Very advanced that I wore with new balance sneakers and a red sweater. I mean, I'm like still I'm like, yes, I'm yeah, it's so good. And then like brown tweed cargoes. And I remember someone being like, you look like you're in college. Score. You know, but here's the thing too, right? It's like I also, again, like I always relate it back to music because like I'm always listening to music and I'm always like listening to all kinds of music. And it's like, okay, cool. Do you like pop music where you hear the song and you immediately like it? But then I think you naturally move away from it more quickly because you're just like pounded by it and then it becomes like very old and you're like, I can never listen to it again. Or do you like music where it's like, Oh, I'm not sure how I feel about that song at first. And then you listen to it again, you're like, Oh, I like a little bit more. And then maybe you like read the lyrics and then you like hear a live version and it's a little more nuanced. And then you become to like really love that song. And then it has holding and lasting power. Like that's kind of how I look at it. It's like I'd rather be like a little more weird, but like thoughtful than just write pop music. I don't know. Yeah. Was that, that's off-topic. That's random. So I mean, it kind of is you like stuff that's like, quote unquote normal, but it's very specific. Yes. How you, this is like my friend who's always like, you like, she's always telling me I like indie stuff. But I'm like, actually, I just let, I'm a basic bitch who likes indie stuff. Like I like basic indie. It's not like there's, but you're very specific. So it's not like, like the way Jacob described your collection, like on the face of it, it's like a collection of clothes, but like it's the details that, that matter. Totally. So let's do your big career because I want to talk about. And then I want to thank Jacob again for that. Yeah. Very sweet of him. That piece was awesome. Yeah, it was very sweet of him. I'm so glad Jacob has this job because he couldn't have written that piece at the Wall Street Journal. It was very sweet of him. I'm very grateful for Jacob. Yeah. Yeah. Let me do my armchair media criticism really quickly, but like. I'm taking no part in the criticism. Yeah. He would be very annoyed if I, he's going to be like annoyed that I'm saying this, but I just think like that's a story that he couldn't have done at the journal. And he had an amazing job there and he did a good job, but like this is why he is great at this new job. And I'm very proud of him. Way to go Jacob. The story was awesome and it was, it was really well done. So out of school and everyone should read it and we're not going to do a huge bio of Aaron because you can just read it in Jacob's piece, but out of school, you've got a job in sales at one of those like preppy like Paul Stewart or something. Right. It was, it was Joseph Aboud. Right. I had. Well, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So not preppy, just kind of like there. And you know, I was like in that position where I was like sitting in Blacksburg, I'd sent out like 60 resumes and I got one back on like yellow card stock from Calvin Klein. I was like, thank you for submitting your resume and it's been filed and I'm like, cool. Right. And I don't want to, I want to make this quick because I don't want to bore you or anybody, but like I got to give a shout out to my mom too. Right. She was on a business trip with my dad and she was sitting next to a woman and they started talking and, and it was like, oh, you know, my son, you know, went to UVA and she's like, oh, my son went to Virginia Tech and what is your son doing? He's like, oh, he's, she's like, oh, he's a retail planner for Joseph Aboud. And, and my mom was like, give me his email address right now so I can give it to my kid. You know, and like because of that, I sent an email to this guy, Tom Hassel, right. And he sent me an email back and he got me an interview and I remember I interviewed for a wholesale sales assistant position three times. I had to go back to this interview, drive to Fredericksburg from Virginia Tech, take a train from Fredericksburg to New York and interview with the Vice President of Sales and HR and like go through the whole process. And I finally got the job for, you know, it was like $28,000 a year or something. Right. But that was my foot in the door and I'm grateful for Tom. I'm grateful for my mom always fighting for me. Shout out Linda Levine. Awesome. Linda, we love you. We love you. We love you. We love Arnie. She just sounds so great. They both are. They're both amazing. They're rocks. Great. So good. So that was the start was with that. Yeah. And then you moved pretty quickly into design, right? Like you and then you worked at a bunch of places and most famously to start Club Monica where you are a part of the hashtag menswear movement. Yeah. Yeah. I would like, I think that kind of the roots of that kind of started at Hickey Freeman, you know, like that, you know, and then from there went to Rogues Gallery and then Jack Spade and then from there, I, that's when I was approached by Club and that was my first vice president job. I think I was 33 and man, that was, I, at that point I realized that I knew absolutely nothing and I needed to like figure it out. And were they owned by Ralph Lauren when you started? They were. Okay. They were. Yep. And then that's where I got to meet Karen Lyon Bellhumor who became one of the most important mentors I've ever had in this job. I wouldn't have made it through club without her. She, yeah, she's awesome. And then that's where like, I was like, okay, cool. I have my priorities wrong. I need to understand accountability on a whole different level, right? Like I need to understand accountability, not to like my ideas and like what I think is right. But it was like, okay, cool. Here's what having a point of view looks like. Here's what service leadership looks like. Here's what accountability to the people on your team looks like. Here's what accountability to the people in the rest of the office looks like. Here's what it looks like to people working in the stores. Here's what it looks like to people working and making your samples. Here's what it looks like to like everybody across the board. How to pay the proper respect across the board and like truly understand what it looked like to be something, be involved in something that's like, okay, cool. You're one small piece in this thing and you're all working together to try to accomplish a goal. Yeah. And what did you feel like you all accomplished there? Because it was a real moment for a moment. You did make an impact. Thank you. I think that, look, we went in and on the men's side, when I started there, I was looking at what Karen Lange was doing and how she was pushing and I'm like, okay, I see this happening culturally in men's and I think we need to go after it, right? And then I would talk with her a lot. I'd be like, I would talk with Steven Catteron a lot who's over at Madewell now, who's an amazing guy. And I would be like, okay, let's understand what this looks like if we really evolve this thing and let's do it quickly. And it was awesome. And man, it was like this, it's like the same kind of thing that you hear other people talk about in different professions and careers creatively where you're like, when you're in it, it is a tumultuous sea, right? It's wild and you're stressed and you're having nervous breakdowns and you're freaking out, but like things are being made and progressing and you're building stores and you're shooting cool campaigns and you're thinking about new ways to ideate creatively and you're broadening horizons like across the board. So it's like, it's like an amazingly stressful but also explosively inspirational time when you're doing that stuff, you know? And that's what it was like. It was awesome. Yeah. What was it like to be a part of that crew of guys that sort of, obviously Michael Williams our mutual friend, you're very, very good friend, the best. I used to interview Michael and Tyler Thorison and all those guys for articles about Benzware in 2009 or whatever. They're all very sweet. Yes, they are. There was like a real and Lawrence and there were blogs, there was Tumblr. It was a real movement of men dressing up and being interested in fashion and the J crew liquor store and what you were doing at Club Monaco and all of it sort of combined. And you were a big part of that. Is that when you first started like getting your photograph taken and like becoming a little bit more of a public figure? What did you think about all of that whole thing? The way that I thought about it was like, oh, wow, like it took a lot of discomfort and like not being great in school and being lost and not knowing what a career looked like. I was like scrambling like all my friends from college were like doing all sorts of different things. And I'm like, maybe I should do what they're doing. Maybe I should do what they're doing. But I'm like, I would be absolutely trash at that. And to like be rewarded by like these amazing friendships from all these people that I got to meet and hang out with by stepping out of your comfort zone and moving to New York and like trying to put yourself in a place where you are surrounded by like minds that people are like interested in the same stuff as you are. So it was just like putting it's like you have to forcibly put yourself into positions where you are surrounded by people where, okay, cool, we're onto the same thing, but we're into it in like different ways and that's totally great. And we can debate about it. We can banter about it. We can have a laugh about it. We can share a beer and like talk about it and like also talk about all other sorts of stuff. So it was just a group of friends is what it was. And I don't mean to be sound cheesy or whatever about this, but like the people that I had the opportunity of hanging out with, it's like we just wanted the best for one another. We would get together and you just like hash out. You would share challenges and like, you know, stresses and things that were exciting and things that you were working on. And it was never, it's not like the R group was never about like out cooling anybody or like, oh, we're I'm doing this or I'm doing that. Like that was like a turnoff, right? It was just about like trying to make stuff, you know, and whether that was like Michael with writing, which he was incredible at and he's incredible at connecting people and incredible at like helping brands become better versions of themselves. Yeah. You know, like Randy Goldberg, who's just a wonderful person and Coggins and Lawrence and like all these people. I just think it was just like, and it was like young people to order people. So it was almost like being in a version of college, right? Where you're like looking up to the people that have come before you and you're like, man, striving to be as good as they were. And then like the younger people are coming up and you're just like, who is my responsibility now to like help them if they call me and they want to have a cup of coffee, right? Then you do. It's funny now though, Lauren, because like I do have like a lot of people like just like hitting me up randomly on Instagram that's like, hey, if you'd have, you know, do you have a couple, you know, do you want to go get a coffee? And I'd like to learn tactically how I operate in my career trajectory to get me from here. And I'm like, yeah, I just, yeah, bro, I just don't have time to do that. I don't have the mental bandwidth, even though you want to. But you're just like, I just don't have the capability to do that anymore. You know? Yeah, I get a lot of people who want to be, me to be interviewed for their like MBA reports or their like their BFA if they're doing some sort of thesis. Yes. And a lot of times they're like, here are questions. Can you respond? And I often just don't, yeah, you just don't have time. It's interesting. I remember emailing people when I was young who were in their 40s being like, can you meet with me for coffee and almost never responded? And now I understand why. It's like when you have kids and you have, you, I mean, I was just going to say that. Erin, you in particular, you have like five jobs, like there are, there's just a lot going on. I just don't have time to even do a call sometimes. Sometimes I'll be like, call me. I can talk for 20 minutes when I'm in the car or whatever. But usually I forget to respond and it's, it's really hard. It's hard because you, you don't want to be disrespectful, right? Like you want to understand like the people that helped you when you were coming up and you want to pay that back. But it's also like, cool, you have five jobs, two kids, two flat tires on two different cars that you got to fix at any given time. A dog, two cats, you know, paint falling off the garage. So it's like, there's like life admin. There is trying to be a good dad, which I would debate. I'm sometimes am and sometimes not, right? And like you're just trying to keep things together and like flowing and constructive. But also it's like, yeah, I might have an hour in that day. That's quiet. But I'm also might need to take that hour and sit on the sofa and just stare at a wall for just a minute and like recharge the battery because it's like, you know, like when I get to sit down and have the opportunity to talk to you at something like this, like I'm stoked. I love having these discussions. But then it's like, cool, my battery depletes. And then it's like, I need to just sit for a minute. Well, it's this whole idea of like whether during the pandemic, I was like, oh, I think I'm an introvert because I realized I was so exhausted by interacting with people. And when the pandemic happened, I didn't have to anymore. I felt so much better. Now I just kind of don't believe in an introvert extrovert because right now, like the last two years having this job and like just living in LA where I'm a little more isolated, I want to be out in the world. I want to go to stuff. I want to talk to people. I'm much more excited about that. But then you, one thing I realized is like, every time I go to New York now, I haven't been to a gallery in forever. Like our really good friend, Jake, had a show at, I forget which one, but like one of the really important galleries in Chelsea. And Dan, my husband got to go and like, I didn't get to go because I was so busy going to all this shit. And so like I need, you forget, and especially your schedule because you're traveling so much and we should get into why, but you forget to like, I need to read books. I never read books anymore. And just like, I mean, I just plug into audible. That's what I'm at online. Yeah. I started doing that too. I started doing that. And I understand that's like a dirty word for, you know, like dedicated readers, you know, but like I, I love it. It keeps me calm. I just plug in a book and I'm just like, I love that. But like to your point about the introvert extrovert thing, nothing is binary, right? Like, as with everything in this world, it's like, when you try to throw a label on it, like I miss or I'm not, well, sometimes you're not, right? Like sometimes I want to go do this. And then you're like, cool, I'm good for four days. Cool, I'm good for four weeks, depending on like what it was, you know? And I just think that I'm constantly like testing the fence and seeing like, and being curious about yourself and seeing like what you're into, what you're not into and just being like open-minded. I just don't think it's like, oh, I mean, because like some days, some weeks I am a recluse introvert, you know? And then I'll go to New York and I'll be like, oh, while I'm here, I want to see this friend for dinner and then I want to see that friend for dinner. And then I'm like going to the studio and I'm like working with this amazing team all day. And then I'm like going to this office and working with that team for a while. And it's like, it just, and that can become like a lot. And by like day four, I'm like time to return to the woods.

So how did you get from Club Monaco to where you are now? You took a big break in New Albany, Ohio, or I guess break isn't the right word, but you were at Abercrombie and Fitch for a long time, right? Like how many years? Like seven years or something? Over six years, I was there. I went there in 2015 and stopped being there in 2021. So, you know, Club was amazing experience, but it was also a very challenging work environment, right? And I lived in New York for 15 years or so, and I was like, I would like to try to do this someplace that's not New York. I think it's like, whenever you grow up someplace, like I grew up in Virginia, and I'm like, I would never move back to Virginia. And then you go away for, you know, a decade and a half, and you're like, maybe I long for some of that chill aspect. So that's what I was like. And then I was thinking, I was like, before the Abercrombie thing even materialized, I was like, I'm like, what big puzzles are out there, right? Of like, what big global vertical retail brands are out there that have the opportunity to be explosive again? In my head, I was like, I mean, Abercrombie can't really get in a more challenging position than it is right now. I'm like, that would be cool to try to tackle that. And then my merchant partner at Club, I was in Paris for Premier Vision or something like that, looking at fabrics, and I get a call from him and he's like, I resigned today. And I was like, you dog, because he was my partner in crime. And I was like, where are you going? Because in my head, it could have been one or two places. I was like, you're going to Abercrombie, aren't you? And he's like, I am. And I'm like, cool. And then a couple months after that, I was like, you want some help? He's like, when can you start? And I was like, now. And then that's how it happened, you know. What was it like there? What did you, obviously, I know that you like living where you are. And it sounds like your family has enjoyed it too. But what was it like being? Shocking, Lauren. Yeah. Shocking. It was shocking. So I'd never been to Ohio before I visited for the job. Even though my family is from Central PA and Pittsburgh, so it's not like I'm alien to me. No, but it is more farm country than... Well, I guess Central PA is too, but it's a different kind of farm country. That's for sure. But after being in New York for that 15 years and working in New York fashion, and for New York brands, stepping onto that campus and seeing how Columbus Ohio retail operates versus New York retail, very, very different. Yeah. And stepping onto that campus, I was like, in 2015, May or whatever, 2015, I was like, I feel like I just stepped into a time machine. 15 years ago. And I'm like, it felt like... I'm like, I don't understand what aspect of culture this brand is trying to tap into right now. You know what I'm saying? Does that make sense? I was like, I don't know who this brand is talking to. And that was when we started to tackle it. And I showed up about four months after Mike Jeffries had left, so I never had the opportunity to work with him. And it was like primordial ooze, man. It was like people fighting for grappling for control and trying to understand who was going to run this thing and how that was going to shake out from an org structure and how to set the direction and the vision and how to get everyone aligned. It was a complex equation. At some point, you took over women's too, right? Yes. You started doing men's and then you took women's too. Yes. And that was awesome. And I think it was just being at the right place at the right time, and I was super passionate about it. And it's like, look, I think a lot of these big jobs, it's not like I knew, oh, how to design a perfect dress or anything like that. But I'm like, when you're so passionate and you're so curious, you start to flip over stones and you start to just understand what people are as crazy passionate about it. As you are. And then you can have dialogue with them and make sure that they're in the right positions and try to remove obstacles for them to accomplish what they're passionate about. And that's what we did with women's. It was just like we tried to put the right people in the right place, support them, have that debate with them, have that dialogue with them, and be curious about product and like, be curious about product and like, be super kind of like, what do we really mess with here? What do we think is cool? And I know that that sounds like a flippant thing to say, because you can't apply data to the term cool, right? And you're dealing with a company that's a multi-billion-dollar company, it's very hard to just be like, well, I like it because it's cool. Well, that doesn't really like get people to sign up and put huge buys behind something, right? So it's like you have to like structurally organize these things. But yeah, that's yes, I took over women's, sorry, long answer. No, no, no. So you were there for six and a half years, you famously got fired, which like is an interesting thing. But this is the thing about you, you're all about vulnerability. You're all you're one of these like vulnerable men, and you've been like very clear and open about it. Look, this is my analysis of the situation. You don't have to say anything. It wouldn't be what it is right now, which is very successful, trend driven, basically a new kind of fast fashion, if you hadn't done what you did, because you were a palette cleanser. And that's like a term that's happening in the industry a lot right now. I think what you did was really, really good. And wasn't perhaps not enough people knew about what you were doing from my perspective. It was so good and every man in America, everyone in America should have been buying it. And for some reason, they didn't all know about it. But when you ended up leaving, A, what did you feel like you accomplished there? When you started consulting and doing all the stuff, and now you're launching your own brand, what did you learn there that you're applying to what you do now? Right. So I think there, I think what I could contribute to that was a catalyst. Like just being a catalyst for change, right? Was like shake the cage. And I wasn't there to just like agree and say yes. And okay, it's easy to say yes, and we build a deck and then we move on. It was like, I was there to say what I thought, right? And like what my true opinion was. And I had a point of view and I fought every single day for the six and a half years or whatever I was there. I was not complacent with okay. I was not okay with good enough being good enough. I wanted to be truly like great at that job, you know, and I wanted to make a difference. And like I can truly say that the day that I started from the day that I started to the day that I left, it was an entirely different company. And there were many, many, many people there that were involved in that change. And I got to be one of them, you know? And then when I got fired over video on the day of my review, for no other reason than the explanation was my role was being eliminated. Which is true. Which is true. If my role was in fact eliminated. And myself. Completely. I was eliminated completely. But, you know, and I was hurt because I was like, I put a lot of effort into that every single day. And then I was shook, right? And then it was funny because I got a call from Mickey Drexler, right? Well, I have a call within 10 minutes. So we have to wrap up. Oh my gosh. Oh my God. Bummer. Bummer. We have to wrap up. Well, tell Mickey I say what's up. But I got a call from him and he said, I don't even know if he'll remember he said this to me, but or not. But like he was like, oh, he'll remember. He was like, look, kid. He was like, no one escapes the gut punch. You know, he was like, I still feel the gut punch that I got from the gap when I was there. You know, Steve Jobs called him the day before to tell him. There you go. So and I'm like to get that call from him. It was like, cool. It's like a badge of honor at this point. And I think that like being vulnerable to it, or it's not even being vulnerable. It's just being honest about it and being transparent with it. Gives takes away the negative aspect of it and it gives you power. It's like, I have that badge on me that yeah, man, I was there for six and a half years. If I sucked at my job, I would have been gone in a year and a half. I would have been gone in two years, you know, but like I contributed to the value of that thing, which is, you know, you get satisfaction from that. So it shook me for a couple. It shook me. I still think about it and I'm still hurt by it. But like after being a weirdo for a couple of months and trying to like, you know, shake it off, I just started working with a bunch of friends with, you know, on a bunch of different projects that I believed in. I believed in the product or I believed in the person or I wanted to work with the people that I loved on product that I loved. I didn't want to be at one specific company for that time period. And I just enjoyed being collaborative with amazing people working in New York, working in LA. We worked in Bologna for a little bit. We were just like, you know, it was very freeing to like apply. You know, I would say that club was like a master's degree and I would say that Abercrombie was a doctorate, what I learned there in terms of how to run a business, right? How to run a business and then and then how to push newness and like be stoked about product and then how to learn whether or not people were going to be into that product or not. Yeah. So you did a bunch of consulting, you did styling, you did design consulting, club monocle on my lay on door, like all these different places. You'd done some stuff for Madewell. You became like also during the pandemic, like a real Instagram person. You post a lot. I feel like you just like become a bigger part of culture yourself. You were always making clothes that were in the culture, but you became a bigger part. And now you're launching this brand, which I believe is will be live by the time this airs, which it will be October 29th, maybe. Yeah. I think we're going to launch it on the 22nd. And then look, look, it's going to be, it's a perfect nope, but we're looking at progress, right? We're going to, we're going to launch what we have when we launch, and then we're going to roll it out throughout that week. We're going to learn about it. We are just going to be thoughtful and slow and steady. And we are not going to get distracted by the noise. You know, I think when a lot of chatter happens around something, all of a sudden, there's just this cacophony of noise that comes with it that you just need to block out. And it's like we keep our circle small. We focus on what we want to like deem our priorities. And we're just going to go from there and we're going to learn about it for you.

It was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize-winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out, it was exciting. Critics and play rights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th. Follow and listen on Apple Podcasts, the Odyssey app, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcast. So being in this business for so long, you've mostly worked for more mass market brands. Mass markets, probably not the right word, but you know what I mean, like big... I mean, I've worked for publicly traded companies for 20 years. Yes, exactly. So you know how this industry works. I remember you and I and my husband had dinner with Scott Sternberg, who was like closing down entire world as you were leaving Abercrombie. And I was just like, you guys should meet because you come from different worlds. But you decided it's like Scott, Scott's a serial entrepreneur who knows what he'll do, but he'll never stop. But the point being, you've seen how hard it is to launch a brand. So like A, why did you decide to do this to yourself? And B, what is it going to be? Tell me about the price point, some of the first pieces that are going to come out that you're really excited about? Sure. In my head, I was like, I'm never doing anything I'm not doing it. So when I was thinking about it, a little more earnestly, I was like the only way that I would do this is if I had a supply chain partner, right? And then talking about Michael Williams, Michael Williams introduced me to a young guy named Josh York, based in Detroit, who is now one of my partners, the other partner being Arturo Castaneda, who's in Brooklyn. They both own small factories, right? Josh has the ability to make cut and sew product in Detroit. Arturo is and Josh is brilliant. He's brilliant from an operational standpoint, logistic standpoint, financial standpoint. He is an organizational mastermind. And he's the one of the hardest working people I've ever met. And he's honest and genuine and true. I love Josh. I trust him. I stay with him and his wife and their baby. I sleep in their basement when I go to Detroit, right? Arturo has a facility, a studio in Atelier in Brooklyn, where he has the ability to make, he made all of our patterns for Wobens, all of our trouser patterns, all of our Wobenshire patterns, all of our outerwear patterns. He made a bespoke suit for Sam, for the event last night, for me, for John Teeds. They can make bespoke through all these amazing, beautiful patterns that are proportionally perfect. And then he has the ability to grade them. And then he has the ability to make small units. So our plan is, okay, cool. I'm not trying to be like a huge business out of the gate. Like, we're like, okay, cool. We'll start small. The three of us own it. We'll make small units. We'll start to understand our customer. And then what works, what they like, what they hate, why they like it, why they hate it, we'll make a little bit more of the stuff that they like. We'll take the stuff that they hate and we'll put it on a shelf and we'll be like, maybe this is the wrong time for that. Maybe not yet. We'll keep a little bit of the line open to us to constantly push for like newness and interesting stuff that we think is interesting and see the resonates with people. We'll try to be culturally relevant. And we'll try to make product that we love, man. And like, I don't think this is like an ego play where it's like, oh, I want to be cool. And I want to like have this like huge business. And I want, it's like, this is literally, and I'm going to relate it to music again. And I know that I don't want that to start to get like boring and like hammering on it. But I'm like, I have to do this, Lauren. Right. Like, I love this. I have to do it. I'm about it. It's my hobby, which is potentially sad, but true. And, and I just need to constantly be doing it. That's why I work with a bunch of different people because I just love it. I love talking about it. I love making it. I love working with people that make it. I like sitting down with people in factories. I like sitting down with design teams. I like sitting down with merch teams to figure out the process. I like, I like the whole puzzle of it. And I don't want to do anything else. But I also want to do something that's pure and true to what we believe in. And I don't want to have to ask for permission to do it. I just want to make it and see if it resonates with people. I'm excited for you. I know we're asking. I know we're going to take our licks, Lauren. I know we're going to take our licks, but I mean, we're going to do it anyway. Yeah, it's going to be hard. And you're going to be like, why did I do this to myself every day? But you know what, you know what I can't wait for for you to start to see like regular guys wearing it and not just not just Sam Hine, who is great, but is a model and also you know, a GQ guy. So like, it'll be, it's going to be awesome for you. And I get it. Like, you just have to do it. You can't do it. Yeah. It's like, why do people open restaurants? Because they just, it's stupid. But like every day you want to make stuff, it's exciting. And like, you have a dream, right? And it's terrifying. And to step out and do something I'm terrifying. It's so easy to be like, that's dumb. Why would you do that? Because some people have to do that. That's the like, you just have to do it. Or else you'll feel unfulfilled. Totally. Aaron, I'm so excited for you. Can you come back on in like a year or six months and let me know how it's going? Absolutely. We'll give you progress reports. Good, the bad, the ugly. We'll be transparent about the entire process. I can't wait. I'm definitely excited to see the plaid shirt. I think you were wearing it when I saw you a couple weeks ago. I definitely was wearing it. I was wearing that. I like it a lot. It's really good. Like, the stuff is good. Yeah, it's really good. The question for that, what is that plaid? It's like a faded plaid. Yep. Is there like a name for that kind of plaid or no? I mean, I just call it, no. Like people call it either shadow plaid or an ombre plaid, something like that. Shadow plaid. Yeah. But what I like about that shirt is like, okay, cool. It's soft. It's a super lightweight flannel. You can wear it in the winter over a t-shirt, under a jacket, keeps you cozy. But like, I also wear those in the summer and I don't know if this sounds psycho, but like, I don't wear a shirt under in the summer and I wear it with swim trunks and it feels like great against sunburn skin. So it's like, there's a thoughtful reason for like the whole process of these things. And it's like, you don't, this is coming from a person that has like a ton of stuff. I'm a hoarder and a self-loathing hoarder, self-loathing stuff lover. But it's like, you'd really don't need a lot of stuff. You just need nice stuff, or maybe sometimes not nice stuff, depending on who you are. And you just can wear it and wear it and wear it and wear it. The more that you wear it, the more it becomes you and you look comfortable in it. And the more you feel comfortable in it, the more your personal like strength comes out, right? When you feel comfortable. If you put on clothes as like a costume, it shows, it smells, I can smell it, right? When you're just who you are and that comes through, that's genuine and true. And that's what it's all about. Aaron, congrats. I'm so excited for you. You're the best. And congrats to you for this whole, for your whole venture that you're doing. Thank you. I'm stoked to be here. Thank you and grateful to be here. I appreciate you. Happy to have you. And I'm sure we'll talk soon. Get some rest. And good luck. Say hi to Mickey Flournay. I will. I can't be late for this. Bye. Fashion People is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck, hosted by Lauren Sherman. That's me.
