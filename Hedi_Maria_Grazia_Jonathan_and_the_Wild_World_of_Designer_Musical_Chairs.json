Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Cuck's Fashion and Beauty Memo Line Sheet. And today with me on the show is designer Scott Sternberg. We're talking chaos in Milan and Paris, celebrity stylist Switcha Ruse, and of course, the rumor of the week. Let's get started. Hey everyone, hope you're having a great week. I am in New York on the first leg of my book tour. My book, Selling Sexy, Victoria's Secret and the Unraveling of an American Icon comes out today. Please buy it if you enjoy reading, or you can also hit up that audiobook if you don't. Later this week on the pod, I am going to be joined by my co-author, Shontal Fernandez, and we're going to talk about the process of writing the book and how we ended up doing it together and all that good stuff, sort of a behind the scenes episode. And we're also running an audio excerpt as a bonus episode. So I hope you enjoy that and maybe it will inspire you to buy the book. If you haven't already, please buy it. I buy like three or four books a week. I don't understand. I thought everybody just buys lots of books. I don't know. It's an interesting industry to be thrust into as a news reporter. Seeing of, in this week's line sheet, I have a bunch about what's happening at LVMH right now. It's like a story that was supposed to be 600 words turned into, it's too long. There's lots of good info from the top to bottom, so I highly suggest you read that. And then I also did a readout of the YNAP MyTresa merger. If you read line sheet, you heard about this in March. I first previewed it back then and it's finally coming to fruition. The merger of Uke's Nettaporter Group and MyTresa requires regulatory approval, but I suspect that'll be fine. And I have a lot of details of why it makes sense, and why it was inevitable, but also why it's sort of a bummer for certain people involved. But generally, it's super positive and I'm happy for everyone. And I hope this is the beginning of a market that actually is profitable and makes money because for years, online luxury has not. So we'll see. The one thing on that, I had a reader on the SMS channel message me and ask, why are we not worried about the FTC going after this deal or the Sax Neiman deal, whereas with Capri Tapestry, Lena Kahn was all over that. And I mean, the main thing is, I think the Lena Kahn sees Tapestry coach bags, Michael Kors bags as things that like quote unquote normal people buy, even though they're positioning them as luxury or accessible luxury in all the arguments. I think you can buy Michael Kors bag for under $200 at an outlet store. And so I think that that is why they decided to go over that aspect. With the retailers, I don't know why. I mean, I think one big thing is that Neiman Marcus and Sax have said that they are not going to close any stores or they have no plans to close stores. So whether or not that ends up being true, who knows. But I think at least in the beginning, they're not going to close stores. So that's part of it. But also the average order value of these companies like Michael Kleeger was the CEO of MyTresa, who's going to be sort of running the whole thing. I was talking about this on the earnings call and like the average order value, his average order value just keeps going up, up, up, up. Like I don't know what it is off the top of my head, but like these are five, six, seven, 100, 800, $900 average order values. This is not mass market, whereas what Capri and Tapestry are selling in some cases is. And so I think that's the biggest difference. I didn't go into that in the piece because there was a lot of other stuff to cover, but you should check it out. No matter. I'm sure I'll be writing about this stuff a lot more in the coming weeks and months. And I hope you enjoy this conversation with Scott. I've known him for a long time. I've written about every company he's ever run, which is I guess only two, but it feels like more than that. We have a long, long history and it was fun to talk to him. He has a really good sense of the industry and like what people are doing and what they should be doing, what they shouldn't be doing. And I hope you enjoy the conversation. So let's get going. Scott Sternberg, welcome to fashion people. Hey. Thanks for being here. Happy to be here. I hope that we can do this without just giggling the whole time. I know. I know. I'll do my best. So you are on a Monday episode, which is, well, a Tuesday episode. So it's the news day. So we don't ask people what they had for breakfast, but sometimes I assume you had something that was white. Beige. Correct. Beige. That's enough. I think that's a good enough description. Sometimes I do ask people what they bought this weekend. And it's funny. I was writing up Line Sheet, Monday's Line Sheet mentioning you and the Google docs said that entire world was misspelled and it should be two words. And I was like, I think I remember it being one word. So I Googled it. And so entire world came up on the real, real. And so I was like, Oh, maybe I should get some stuff. I never thought that that brand would proliferate on resale sites. It was like you buy this for yourself and keep it, right? I agree. I did keep most of my, some of my stuff got too stained and I had to like, I think dispose of it or do whatever you do. But can I just tell you that a sweatshirt is currently, and not everything else, everything else is a little more affordable, but there is a sweatshirt on there right now that was originally $115 that is $92 still. Piled. They were $88 original retail. It's on sale for $92. So the value of these products is remarkable. That warms the cockles of my heart and also speaks to the fact that they were underpriced, hence us not being in business anymore. So we're going to talk about other designers today. What are you, but what have you been up to? Can you say anything you've been up to? Probably not. Oh gosh. Listen, I hate this word, but I consult for brands. I do brand stuff. I do design stuff, beauty, fashion, et cetera. Typically, contractually, I put it in there that we don't talk about the fact that I'm working with brands, which allows me to extract my ego from the process and just try to help them achieve their goals. Well, I would assume the other thing is sometimes they may want to use you as marketing, and that could be brand diluting for you. Yes, and depending on the brand, I think back to my CAA agent days, understanding long-term relationships, I try to leave that bit as step two or step three so I can get paid more. Yeah, that makes sense. So the first thing I planned, I sent you some topics yesterday, a little rundown of what we would discuss. The first topic on here was whatever news is announced Sunday morning, because I had said, wrongly assumed there would be news because on Friday, executives at Caring sent out two emails. One said that they were going dark on social on October 6, dark on social and online advertising on October 6, which is today, the day we're recording this on Sunday. And then the other point was they sent a second email saying, please, if someone emails you asking for comment about Maria Grazia Ciori going to Gucci to say no comment, I reached out to them and I haven't heard back from them regarding any of this. And I probably won't because to be honest, if they told all of their teams to say no comment to me, why would they comment? But I just assumed something was happening. Maybe it's still will. It's 2pm in Los Angeles or maybe it'll happen on Monday morning. No idea. I'm going to record the top of this podcast on Monday afternoon. That way I can catch anything. But the main thing is that there's just a lot of craziness in Milan and Paris last week with who's going where, why people would be moving from one house to another, our contracts being negotiated. Is Jonathan Anderson going to Dior? Is Kim Jones leaving LVMH altogether? Is Maria Grazia suddenly going to Gucci, which I had heard pre-Savato Nassarno going to Gucci that they had talked to her? So I don't know. I've talked to a lot of people who are close to these situations. It seems like 95% of this stuff is BS and maybe one of that thing will come true. But from your perch, what do you think of all these designer musical chairs? Do you think it's worse than it used to be or do you think it's the same and we just have more iterative, more granular internet people going through it day to day? I think the latter to a large extent. I think what I love about our industry is just how much success relies on a singular creative vision driving that success. And the reality of how challenging it is to find alchemy between that vision and then the business structure in place, the people in place, the moment that that's happening. Yeah, and it's this fun stuff to talk about. I think Maria Grazia Gucci seems like a little rando and a miss to me, but I don't know anything. Same. It's interesting. I think that so much of what these brands are selling is more than products. They're selling a culture and a set of ideas and values and all that stuff. So getting all those things to a line, it's really tough. I don't know. I've never really been recruited for any of those brands, so I don't know what those conversations are about. I mean, I guess I've done a project or that's not true. I have sort of been recruited for some of those brands, but it's more the stuff I would want to talk about. I don't know if that's necessarily what is being discussed, which is maybe a little heady and not so not as slim and heady, but heady intellectual value stuff versus product. But I don't know. We'll talk about Eddie, not heady later. But on the Maria Grazia thing, yeah, I think it made sense to me pre-Savito, because they wanted to make Gucci into, I don't know, $15 billion, $20 billion brand, and she is good at that sort of, she's good at that Mastiche thing. She did it with Dior, but now it feels like in order for Gucci to do well in the next 20 years, they actually need, either they stick with Savito and Savito keeps developing this and they take a, I don't know, a quote unquote long-term view, which I don't know if you can even say long-term when it comes to these companies anymore, but and do the sort of classic look or whatever he's going for, or you hire a sort of disruptor type and make it really fun in a totally different way than the way Alessandro made it fun. And that seems more exciting to me, but I don't know. Yeah, I don't think it's about product and merchandising at this point. I think it's about a cultural reset about why do we care about Gucci? What does it mean? You know, I was watching the Vogue Hulu thing in the 90s bit and Tom for Yeah, I need to watch it. Yeah, I mean, you don't need to watch it, but there's a couple. I do need to watch. I'm getting pressure from people to watch. Okay. People are like, why haven't you written about it? I'm like, I have not had time. I had to watch the show about the Shiksa and it was more important. Oh, I'm going to rewatch that show. I want to live inside of Adam Brodie's universe forever. But Tom and they talk about Gucci and how, you know, he designed three or four seasons before the velvet suit sexy satin shirt season. It took him a while to kind of hit on not this kind of idea of what a Gucci woman would want to wear or heritage or any of that, but kind of align his own vision and what sort of drives him his studio 54 days with with this brand and it all kind of hit. I don't know anything about Sabato from what he seems really sweet on his Instagram. From what I've seen so far, he and a lot of these guys that are and women, but mostly men who are being discussed for these jobs are incredibly competent designers who have done their time on teams in Europe for years. And they seem the most obvious, you know, sort of place to go to kind of let's bring this person up. And that's not the qualifications for running a house like Gucci at all, like at all at all, right? So and sometimes this will really work like Botega and Matthew, that really aligns because it's so much about craft and it's so hard felt and it's small enough that it can kind of, you know, sort of swim in those ideas and they really play well with the accessories. I think Gucci needs a much, much bigger vision that doesn't actually start with like a bag, but starts with like, why are we here? Why should anybody care? Yeah. So regardless of what happens with Sabato, which I agree, I think he, it's just, it's also hard to your under this microscope. I've definitely talked about this in Line Sheep, but probably on this podcast too, the way that he was sort of positioned as this larger than live character when no one knew who he was in the beginning. It makes it hard when there was actually some cute stuff and you just can't think of it as just cute stuff because the way it was positioned to be like way bigger than that when it wasn't. Totally. Totally. I mean, that's, it's so hard. I mean, think about Phoebe having to start under her microscope. And like with no room to experiment or get feedback or whatever, it's just like, it's tough. Every little mistake. I mean, in some ways it's part of the art. If you think of what Phoebe's doing is like an art project, it's like all the mistakes are sort of part of it. But that is not easy. That's not the way a lot of people see it. Do you think that this kind of all stems from that era of that, that big change in fashion when people like Demna and Virgil Abloh sort of came to the front of things and Demna was classically trained, but Virgil wasn't. He was an architecture student. I don't know if he was like, don't you have to have like a license to be an architecture? So I don't know if he ever got that far, but he went to architecture school and they were, I remember talking to executives in the US who would be like, they've changed the way this works. Like you need to not just be a designer and an atelier making beautiful clothes. You need to also be a marketer. And you are also part of this. Like you can do creative advertising campaigns and not touch the clothes and still have an impact. It's very like 360 brand builder. Do you see that as like the sort of change, the rise of the two of them at Louis Vuitton and Balenciaga respectively, like as the shift in the way these brands operate and now like they're kind of biting them in the ass in some cases. Well, yeah. Listen, first of all, I can't really have an impact 360 unless I'm really into the product. Like I work with a consulting client now and I do just visuals, just campaigns. And it's really fun because I finally have a budget to shoot stuff, but I have nothing to do with the product. And it's kind of a bummer. I mean, like, because it's just putting lipstick on a pig or whatever, right? It's not, it's not really doing that. It really is a 360 thing. And I think to some extent, I'm trying to think back, you know, I don't really know a ton about RAF, but from what I saw from that Dior and I documentary, he's a mood board guy. He's a narrative guy. He is not sitting on his, he's not on his knees, like pinning up a hem and a fitting maybe is. So I don't know if that was a decision, like a proactive decision by these executives to say, we need to hire culture, cultures to run these brands versus trained designers. I think culture was telling them that in so many ways, the market was telling them that, you know, I'm a guy who like launches brands, this business of like heritage brands and keeping them fresh, you got to kind of mix things up, right? Like, you got to go to new sources, not just new designers from different houses, but people who think in different ways, people who are thinking, who are iconic lasts, like Virgil is an iconic last, you know, that's really his thing. He's like me to some extent, I'm always just thinking about the system. How's the system set up? How can I completely fuck with it while leveraging the best of it? And that whittles down to product, you know? Yeah. What do you think of LVMH selling off white to, I don't even remember the one of these licensing firms, I don't even remember the name of it. The dustbin of the industry. I think it was inevitable. I think, you know, there is value to be extracted in a capitalistic situation. That value will be extracted. So I don't think anything LVMH is about would help off white as what it is right now become anything. I don't think off white is Virgil's legacy. I think its legacy is strong enough to kind of live beyond that. Like, I don't even think of many, I think of Pyrex vision and the Nike stuff, the 10 specifically, like that stuff and the Ikea stuff he did with off white. But I don't think his legacy needs it. And I think, I don't know, it honestly felt a little cynical to me off white post Virgil. It did. I wasn't hitting. Yeah. By the way, the licensing firm is Blue Star Alliance, just so everyone knows. They also own Catherine Malandrino. She have the American flag dress. I used to do her reviews for sell.com. Oh, wow. Yeah. So look, I agree with you to the extent of do I think the stuff that's like in the design museum in London, or in the Museum of Modern Art in New York is like tainted because off white is owned by one of these stupid companies. No, not necessarily, but I do think like, and I also don't think Elvian Mates should own it. Like that's not the business that they're in. It was obviously like they were investing in him, not in that company in particular. I wonder if there was just like a more, I hate to use Lord Humane, but just like a nicer way to do it. Because it reminds me of, have you ever looked at the designs of Willie Smith? Oh my God. I wore them growing up. I worship Willie Ware and Willie Smith. It's very you actually. Yes. Yeah, it's very you. So they did a Willie Smith exhibit at the Cooper Hewitt, I want to say 2021. And I was so blown and it makes total sense that this would be something that you would have a connection to because I was just so blown away by it was like, this is the most important American designer, like one of the most ever. And the only thing I know about it is from TJ Goh seeing it at TJ Maxx. And like, I've looked online to try to find stuff. There's nothing from his actual, his actual line. I'm sure that he barely sold any of it. And so the only thing left is the licensing and look like there's a, there's a Virgil Abloh foundation. There's a lot more, the world is different now and and his, his wife and family and all the people who care about him will make it, you know, they'll like work to preserve it. But I just think like, I wish that you could just close something. Listen, I loved how Pollyanna you're being business writer, like it's very sweet. Two points there. First of all, these dustbin licensing companies, companies like Band of Outsiders or Entire World would never get financed that they didn't exist. They represent a potential liquidity event down the line that makes it valid to actually start something new. So where's my, where's my Band of Outsiders stuff at TJ Maxx that? I know. Well, it was in century 21 when we liquidated for quite some time. I have a lot of the real stuff still. So, well, I'd love to hear it. But, you know, listen, when I closed Band, I didn't close Band. I left Band because an investment deal, I walked away from it and so they got the IP. I thought in my mind and my perfect little conceptual mind that I was going to walk away and it'd be dead and it would be, they would have a beginning, middle and end and an end and just like you described, it would have a nice little bow around it. There's my little project and maybe a few years after I died at some tiny little museum in Dayton, Ohio where I grew up, there'd be an exhibit. They tried to relaunch it twice, completely bastardized it. You know, like it's just not, again, we're in a capitalistic system here. If there is value to be extracted, it will be, it will be wrung out until the last dollar I felt bad for them. I did the interview with those guys when they relaunched, tried to relaunch it the first time. Those guys were real sweet. I wonder what happened to them. If you guys, guys, if you're listening, call me. I'm curious to the British guys. I think they were like one of them was Britain. There were three of them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They was all, they were very sweet, but it was, it just was like not a good. Not a good situation. God bless. God bless, Lush. Okay.

Let's start reliving your terrors of fashion industry. Let's move on to something. So, understood I'm being too nice about Virgil. It is what it is. We'll see what happens. Whatever. I mean, look, like he changed the fashion industry. I can't read to read Robin Gavon's book, which hopefully we'll talk a lot about this. So, moving on to something way more fun. Yes. Did you notice that Sir Sharonon got a new stylist? Of course I did. I know Danielle, Nakmani slash Goldberg. She was Tina's assistant back in the day. So, I worked with her before. She was Tina Chase's assistant. That's so funny. Yeah. Oh, that makes sense. I understand that lineage. Yeah. Yeah. And she, I assume, was a big part of her sister wearing a lot of entire world, which sold a ton of sweatsuits. So, I love Danielle very much. I have noticed. I thought that was an interesting one for her. Yeah. It's really interesting because Sir Show worked with Elizabeth Saltzman for many years. And I have to say, like, I think Saltzman did a good job with her. I thought she always looked great. But the last two weeks, it's like total flip. And she's like hot. She looks so good. And she was always like really beautiful and always looked fabulous. Like I would have never been like, that's someone who needs to change stylist. And suddenly, I mean, Danielle is, what do you think it is about Danielle that makes her so good at celebrity styling in particular? Like, what do you think it is that she has that can like key into someone's personality or something? Yeah. I mean, first of all, she gets out of the way of their personality. You know, like, all of these women are such singular talents. They, you know, sure they're all indie or whatever, but like there's something so idiosyncratic about them and their own personal style. And there's a minimalism and a purity to what Danielle does. It's not about adornment. You know, it's sort of about pulling stuff back. So that kind of approach really helps, you know, so it lets somebody be them. Shersha is interesting because I don't know, I'm just projecting. She's not somebody that seems to me to care about fashion. No. Or to have a super strong sense of personal style. Whereas, you know, Greta Lee or IO, you throw a dress on her, either of them. And they just like immediately know how to stand in that dress. You know, it's just like models when you're casting or like that girl knows how to wear clothes. And Shersha doesn't necessarily, it's not like her strength. So I thought she was an interesting one for Danielle out of that whole group, because all those women are just, they're incredible the way they wear clothes. But I'm into it. It feels like it's still trying to find itself. Like I've seen, you know, there's like lots of silhouettes going on, lots of color. But Shersha's so cool. Like in a way, I didn't notice it first, because like if you'd see her doing a, you know, Jimmy Kimmel or whatever, like she's so weird and cool. And like, I don't know, like she comes from a different land, you know, a different time and place. Yeah, I wonder if like a lot of times when these, who, I don't know anything, I truly don't. I haven't talked to any party involved. So I don't want to project too much because there might be a reason that like nobody needs to know that for the switch, but oftentimes when these things happen, it's like people just like want to change up or they often it's like a, their career, they feel like their career is being affected because their clothes are bad and they switch. And in this case, like that can't, that can't be it. But maybe there was just like, I just want to change. And I did, I noticed a very particular shift in the like vibe of it. And also that she was being photographed more. So like there, there is a photograph of like a street look that's all blue again. I was just on red carpet. With the button up shirt. Yeah. It's perfect. That's exactly what she should look like all the time. By the way, that felt like her. There's just an attitude that feels very modern. Maybe Elizabeth just busy, by the way, like you never know, you know, I have a feeling it's something like very low drama. And also it's not something I'm going to be like, but it's Farragama resort. It's interesting that it's Farragama. I mean, it just looks really good. And she looks, she looks like she is young and she looks kind of, I thought she looked really good in that Hoda Koba dress. But yeah, it's fun. I mean, I think you're right. I'm obsessed with Hoda Koba. It's good. Did we talk about it on Friday night? I don't remember. No, it was really interesting because I went to see Marie Adam Leonard. Maybe, maybe I talked about this with someone else on a different podcast. I can't remember. But I went to see the Marie Adams Leonard and then I went to Hoda Koba. And they're both LVMH price and Marie Adams Leonard, I love her. She worked for Demna. She worked for, yeah, I did. She worked for Demna for like a little bit, I think maybe an intern or something. She's Belgian and her stuff is like very like kind of weird patrician clothing. So it's like very dressed up, but like a little weird. And I got a, she has, she's in a lot of the big retailers already. And I really like it, like has a lot of commercial appeal. And the show was fine. Like it was good. I like her. She had it in this bistro that all the Belgians go to before, after they get off the train in Paris, it was really fun. But like the show itself, I was kind of like, this wasn't as exciting as I thought it would be. And then I went to Hoda Koba right afterwards. And I was sitting with a stylist who I really admire. And she said, it's just very clear. Like it's just very easy to understand what she's doing. Exactly. It cuts right through. I was so impressed. I am so impressed. I just think it's rad. And I get the Margiela stuff, but it's like, Duchamp came before Margiela. Like these aren't, these modes of thinking and designing and this process is nothing new. This is, this is a stream. This is something some of us do. I also, at the show A, they had these amazing chairs and B, she had like a screen up, very 80s of the runway. I'll send you some of the photos, but it looked so good. Cause it was like, you could see the close up of the faces as the models walked. It was, it was cool. She's, she's a really interesting person. There's some, it's like, when things are extremely weird, but somehow still feel really chic, that's when I get really excited. Like Duran Lantig is the same thing. It's like, that's weird, but like, this is glamorous and chic and so into it. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. That's a good, a good, good, good. This show is brought to you by Boca.

Coming back to our designer musical chairs and the rumor of the week. So the big thing on Thursday and Friday and Wednesday as I was flying home, because I think Wednesday was the day that it was announced that Eddie was leaving. Yeah, it was. I was on the plane and someone texted me on the plane being like, are you flying? And I was, I knew that it was going to be because I had heard two days earlier that Eddie was, that his team was told he's not here anymore. And it was, his team was told on Tuesday, Eddie is not here anymore. And then on Wednesday it was announced. But like, I still didn't believe it on Tuesday because it's just one of those things that you just do not know until they do the announcement because someone like that could change their mind last minute. I have a feeling this was organized as long as we thought it was, which is like nine months ago, it was organized or six months ago or whatever. But how does team not know these guys take their teams with them? Don't they? I mean, Alessandro did to Valentino. Yes, I think some of them did know, but I think generally, A, he was there. And with all this stuff, there's probably a grander plan that only a couple people know about. Yeah. Meaning him and Mr. Arno, or him and Mr. Arno and Mr. Arno's wife, you know, like a very small group of people. And I also think there's, I mean, there's obvious there have been many changes. A lot of his team has, is now working. There's like eight people at Caring, which is interesting. Yeah. A lot of them are at McQueen, but elsewhere also. And that also just makes sense. Like your person, you know, this person's leaving or you get the feeling that this person's leaving. Yeah. You want to find a new job and you all go to different things together. So I don't know if that really indicates that he's, he's headed to back to Caring or something like that. There was a big rumor that he was going to Armani, which is not true. Really? That's a really good idea. I know. I mean, maybe it will, again, like maybe it, maybe there's a grander plan that no one knows about. And three years from now or a year from now, it will, it will happen. But from what I was told, it's not true, sadly. That is sad. I see, he makes more sense there. Or as I told you on Friday, my left field idea of Ralph Lauren. Oh yes. He would be perfect there. I love that. Then, and I, then a place like Chanel, because Chanel is not really about the clothes to make. And Eddie, Eddie is a master merchandiser, fantastic clothing designer. Yes. All the whole, all the other stuff. He creates a world with just like photographs. Like he's amazing. But like Chanel is just not about the clothes. I know that sounds weird, but so it just seems like a weird waste unless he can unlock this whole world of incredibly expensive out of reach apparel. I don't know. Yeah. I think one thing is that Chanel is a very happy brand. Yes. And he is a very serious designer. Moody. Yeah. Moody. I love his clothes. And I thought that that last Celine collection was great. And I saw a lot of people went to the Risi and it looked amazing. I didn't know, but it looked really, really good. But I do wonder, it's like a very Chanel is a happy brand. And it may need someone from the marketing perspective who can really bring that level of jubilance to it that like it requires. Totally. And maybe he doesn't, maybe he doesn't have that. Whereas all these other brands are talking about are serious enough, even Ralph Lauren gets very self serious. So like it could work. Yeah. I mean, it could use a little bit of humor. Yeah. Little self awareness. Yeah. I went to a very cute kids birthday party yesterday that was not in my not in Eagle Rock. If that makes sense. It was further west. Got it. And a lot of the moms had on ball Chanel ballet flats. And like these were people, not people who work on fashion. Maybe there were a couple of fashion adjacent people, but not really. Like I knew very few. I knew probably three people who were at this party. And it was more like food world people and just neighborhood people. Everyone like looked really nice, but it wasn't brand driven in the way you know, you go to certain East side party or really far West side and you're getting like very specific brands. But there were a lot of moms in ballet Chanel ballet flats and they looked really new. It's also you know, move around in LA. So you can stuff can look new for like shoes last a while. Yeah. But it just made me think like this brand is they really don't need to hire someone. No, I mean, yes and no, I don't, I don't yeah, I just don't that conversation around that brand. You know, putting one you look backing up LVMH carrying designer musical chairs. Okay, fine. Totally makes sense. They're like it's like a blend across all these brands and they can really kind of stomach that sort of roller coaster Chanel, Burberry Hermes, like look at Burberry as an example, like, how are they even considering putting all of their eggs in another basket right now? Like, what a bad move. What are they going to there's no way to mitigate that again, if it doesn't work. It's so totally irresponsible. And is it and this is something like I'm just not a traditional designer, right? Like I just don't think that way. And like, I look at those brands all three of those and they just need to function on a completely different level. So at the same time, we buy products and clothing in particular, rapidly when there's a singular creative vision behind it, and we can we understand that person and we feel connected to that person. Another reason why I would posit Phoebe isn't such a force out of the gate, because we're not hearing from her, we're not seeing her, I don't know why you started a brand called Phoebe Filo and disappear. But like for Chanel, yeah, like you said, I don't know if they really need to be focusing on that. I don't think the girls that in West Hollywood or wherever you were really large, large, I don't think that tracks definitely doesn't track there. But you know, the machinations of how all of this stuff works, over time, it will matter. Yeah. Well, going back to Burberry, that's interesting that you said that. You know, maybe they will, they will stick with Daniel. Maybe he has bigger ideas and maybe it was just the wrong mix of people and maybe with Josh Schumann, and they have a new CMO as well, Jonathan Keiman or Keeman, I don't know how to pronounce his last name, but maybe the new mix will work really well. But I'm curious what you think, because they are just kind of screwed because they're a public company. And the market has just responded so badly to everything. And I don't think no matter what they do, unless they like suddenly have a giant hit that just becomes super popular, which seems impossible to achieve right now in this market, no matter how good you are. Like, what would you do if you were them? As a business owner or as a creative director? I have both. I mean, you've been both multiple times. Yeah, for better or worse. God, it's a big question. I think it needs a complete, it goes back to that question of what I ask any client when they are at the beginning, like, who are you? Why are you here? And why should anybody give a shit? Right? Like, what is your purpose? And they have completely lost it. I do not think the purpose is outerwear, either. I think it's a deeper question about that's a merchandising answer, right? But like, that's not their solution. People buy one coat a year. Like, that's not going to do it. I think there's there's just some deep excavation of what is an brand with incredible heritage that's, you know, every bit of that aesthetic that they sit on is where Ralph Lauren came from, where Ivy Dressing came from, Tommy, you know, you think we're band of outsiders came from. But it needs to connect to now, it needs to connect to it needs to weave itself through the threads of popular culture right now, not only right now, actually, where it's going to be in about three years. So it's a every lever needs to be kind of upturned and investigated with a sense of purpose. It's just there's no genuinely super talented, right? And he really hit on a moment with Botega. I didn't like the product when I saw it in person, it was stiff and kind of not approachable. But he really he hit a vibe, but it was a fashion vibe. It was a seasonal vibe. It wasn't a cultural, big, you know, seismic, tomfool Gucci sexy velvet suit. Yeah, I mean, all good points. I agree. The one thing I would push back on is, don't you see the success of Montclair and think that Burberry could have a similar type of success? Like to me, that trench coat, every single person should own one in the way. No doubt. No doubt. And you could argue that, I mean, I guess Montclair has more function, but you could argue that the trench coat, because every but it's getting warmer everywhere, is even more necessary now than it was 10 years ago. Do you think it's just not enough? Yeah, I don't think it's enough. I think it's a good starting place, but I don't think it's enough. And you got to be careful with like heritage and British heritage and all that can get corny very fast. But I think there's so much they should be looking at Hermes and this and Chanel in terms of craft. You look within England and Scotland and Ireland, that whole area, I spent, I got in a car for two weeks and drove around to the factory that Chanel eventually bought as one of their Metier for cashmere and Le Carrin to make custom tartans and all this stuff. There's so much beauty and craft there that with a modern hand and some really good storytelling, I think could really captivate people. Not to mention all of the annals of British culture from the 60s when like 60, 70, I mean, you name it. So I think there's a lot to do. I think a trench coat's too small. It's not practical enough. It doesn't rain that much other than London. Yeah. And in London, it doesn't really rain. It just like drizzles every four or five hours. So one final question on that and then I will let you let you go. But how important do you think it is for these brands to hire people who come from the place that the company is based? Because the way that it happened in the 90s, it didn't matter Tom Ford at Gucci and Saint Laurent or Marc Jacobs at Louis Vuitton, like Michael Corsiz, it didn't matter that these people were not or McQueen at Givenchy and Galliano at Giverny. You know, all that stuff. It didn't matter that they weren't from those places. But recently, it's interesting as we become more globalized. It's felt like, like even talking to, I was talking to someone this morning about Eddie and saying they said something and I think they meant it more about Gucci, they're like, oh, it'd be weird to have not have an Italian there. And it's like, but there wasn't, there was a time it wasn't an Italian. And this wasn't an Italian person who said it. But like, do you think that that matters? Or do you think that? Why do you think that's like becoming a thing when it wasn't for so long? I don't know. Maybe a pendulum swing. I don't think it matters at all. I mean, I actually think I really don't. I think these are global brands that reflect should be a mirror on a mirror upon and a reflection of global culture through their filter, through their lens. And I tend to think coming from the outside, looking in like, look at how Junior Watanabe reinterprets Americana every season. It is so amazing. It's so radical. It's so surprising. It's like, you could never do that from the inside, right? Yeah, I think it's moot. I don't think it's a thing at all. Because it a lot of times it can have the opposite effect to feel like a gimmick. Like, here's our new British person doing her British brand. We're just so global. Our references are so back to like a Virgil. Like that type of him at Vuitan, man. Wow, that was exciting. That was something. Cultural, geographic, all these things kind of converging and clashing. That should be the first consideration. So our main vote on this podcast is Eddie for Ralph Lauren. That's mine. Although Scott Sternberg for Ralph Lauren first, but if not me. How about Scott Sternberg for Burberry? I'm in. I do it. Sign me up. Well, if anyone's listening, I want a commission. For me or them. Both. I don't know. I guess I'm not allowed as a journalist to take either. I just want public recognition. Scott, this was really fun. You did a good job. Are you going to come back? I'm so glad. Yes, I'm done. As long as I didn't stick my foot in my mouth. You didn't. You didn't say anything criminal. We need to think of a topic next time like a deep dive. I need someone. I don't think you can do this as a designer, but I need someone to do a deep dive with me on the row. And I'm having a hard time figuring it out. What specifically do you want to dive into? Why it works? Why it works? Why it's happened? It's an incredible anomaly. I'm working on something right now where I'm basically looking at the row, Kate and Tom Brown and trying to really dissect these three brands and understand what happened. What were the inflection points that led to all the success and the row is the most difficult one to do? Because those two women have really created a mirage of desire. I mean, they really just nailed it. Restraint. That is my short answer on the deep dive there. Restraint. We'd love to see it. Maybe I'll have you back to discuss. Scott, this was great.
