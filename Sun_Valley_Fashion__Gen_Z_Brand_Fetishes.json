You should subscribe is joining me today to talk billionaire style. Dylan, welcome to Fashion People. This is my maiden voyage. I'm so excited to be here. So can you really briefly explain why you are in Idaho right now? Yes. So for those who don't know, Allen and company conference every July after the fourth, the masters of the universe, certainly all of the big media CEOs, tech CEOs, descend on the Sun Valley Lodge at the invitation of her valid to there's programming, you know, Bill Gates will go on stage or, you know, they'll have offline someone to talk about AI or climate or whatnot. But the main event is really what most of the attendees recall speed dating, which is they basically meet with everyone over the course of three or four or five days and dine together and have a lot of conversations. And there's this sort of lore that this is where the deals happen, that all of the M&A sort of takes place in one week in Sun Valley. That is obviously not true at all. These are all functioning adults with vast teams who have the ability to have a meeting with one another or pick up the phone anytime they want. But seeds of conversations happen here, general sort of like narratives pick up here. And there have been some deals in the past, one that's always sort of looms large in my world is Jeff Bezos buying the Washington Post. Anyway, the Lodge is off limits to all media, save for those who the sort of Gale kings of the world, who are there as moderators. But I find it extraordinarily useful to come here not to shout questions at the executives, although some people do that, but rather to meet with those that I know on the sidelines, get introduced to some of those that I don't. And in that regard, it is sort of like speed dating or speed sourcing for me. Plus, there are worse places to be in the middle of the summer than the sawtooth fat. Okay, we're going to get into why you are on fashion people in one second, but one follow up question to that. Where do you hang out? Because it used to be that there was like a place for the reporters, right? And that went away or something changed over the last couple of years about how the reporters are sort of looped into the event. Yes. So back in the day, there was a time when the reporters could go into the Lodge. They could drink with sources at the bar. What I just sort of thought of is like the golden age of Sun Valley from a media perspective. And then I think at least the myth is that Charlie Gasparino of Fox Business somehow did something indiscreet and got everyone kicked out. I'm not sure if that's true or not. But anyway, people are basically pushed to the sidelines. And so a lot of the reporters stopped going because they felt like it wasn't worth it. This is a small place and Sun Valley Village, which reporters are allowed to come into, has a cafe where you can sit all day and work. And there are a few other reporters here from Bloomberg and CNBC. And the executives walk back and forth between their meetings and their various events. And I think in large part because they feel like they are here alone. They're not here with their direct reports even or even their handlers necessarily. It's just them. I think they feel like their guard can come down and feel like they can be a little more open. So I sit in the cafe, they come into the cafe, I see them out the window, I run out the window and we talk and catch up. And it's usually very fruitful. It's kind of like standing outside of a fashion show venue. Yeah, exactly. I imagine it would be. So the reason you are here today is to talk about the fashion show that goes on at Sun Valley. And I feel like this is the last couple of years that this has really become a thing. But they're walking up and down this path and there's all these Getty images. And a couple of years ago, you ranked, like most of these executives, five years ago, were wearing branded vests like Patagonia jackets with their company name on it, Very Silicon Valley Look Circa 2016. But something has changed in the last few years where the people who are showing up who are billionaires, who are very, very famous, maybe it's because like friends will on, repeat, no, and people like that come. Alexander Arnaud is supposed to be, he's on the list this year. I don't know if you've seen him. I haven't seen him on the Getty images yet. But there are more fashion executives. Diamond Furstenberg always comes with Barry Diller, but you know, that's, that's, they bring a lot of their companions, Stacy, Ben, Ben Day or Bendit. I don't actually know Eisner who's married to Michael Eisner's son is there. But it has become like a real fashion show. I had a lot of industry people messaging me who definitely don't know who Charlie Gasparino is because I certainly don't. What is like going on? Why are these things happening? What has changed about the fashion and this sort of like runway thing that's going on in the midst of this conference? Well, yeah, I mean, first of all, you're absolutely right about what traditionally has happened here, which people are given a vest or a fleece of some sort, which is unremarkable, but for the distinction that it confers upon the attendee. There's no greater invitation in the media and text space than being sort of invited to Sun Valley. And like, you know, if you are, if you're a executive at Disney, right? And if Bob Iger brings you to Sun Valley, that is, that is huge. That is monumental. And so you wear that vest with pride. But yes, I think, I think for a lot of people, they're sort of branched out a little bit more and we shouldn't overstate the case. There is a norm here, which is initially there's like this thing, it's sort of, it can be quiet luxury, but as often as not, it's quiet practicality. There is, you do get a sense from a lot of these people that they are just wearing the simplest thing that they could put on. And there are a lot of t-shirts and jeans or polo shirts and khakis. It is not terribly remarkable in that regard, although they tend to be, you know, Tom Ford polo shirts. There are some standouts. You have obviously Stacy Bende, as you mentioned, who sticks out here in a massive way because of her fashion sensibility, which is very different from say, you know, Peter Thiel or Asa Yenedela. You have a lot of sort of, there's a lot of, especially among the women, there are a lot of, a lot of white pants there, you know what I mean? That sort of thing. But it is, it is, it is really casual and informal in that, in that regard. But then you have the occasional flair of like a David Zaslaw stepping out in a, in a $4,500 Brunello Cuccinelli trucker corduroy jacket and a white bandana tied around his neck, which invites no small amount of mockery from some of the other attendees. And it is, you know, it's, there are not that many people here trying to make a big statement, but you do sort of get a read on what the wealthiest business leaders wear in their off time. The Zaslaw white bandana. I think the jacket, whatever. I mean, I don't think it looked right on him. I think he looked much better at the white party, Michael Rubin's white party the, the weekend before. But the white bandana, that, it's a weird statement. And also it just looked like a bandana that they bought on Amazon. It wasn't like a nice bandana. It wasn't, it was quite weird. I noticed like Brian Lord had a denim shirt on the CAA CEO. A lot of denim shirts, a lot of Western. Stacy, who is the CEO of Allison Olivia, this pants company that she started, I don't know, 15, actually 20 years ago at this point, Andrew Rosen, a big fashion investor is her investor backer in that business. She had on like a basically aware in the world is Carmen San Diego red getup. And then you messaged me about her cowgirl, like a basically a white cowgirl denim look with like, and this I think was probably her design, just like black like paint, brush strokes all over it. Why is she there? Like, why, why is she there? Is she trying to sell her company? Is she just like there to support Eric Eiser, her husband, who I don't really know what he does. I'm sure you can explain it. Yeah, no, I mean, there, there, there is a sense, you know, it's not, it's not just as though the people who are invited who are, who might be wanting to do deals. There is a sort of a community that has built up over time that sort of continues to get invited by dint of they were invited in a previous year. They have a relationship to somebody they're sort of viewed as like a member of the community, you know, Katzenberg left Hollywood a long time ago. He still comes Bobby Kodak just sold Activision to Microsoft. He's here anyway. There, there is this sort of community that has built up over time and she, she is sort of a, I guess, a valued member of that community. I wish and I have to tell you, Lauren, since I met you and since you joined Puck, this has happened to me so often, but you know how they have apps you can like point at a tree and it will tell you the species of tree it is. Like I so wish I had your knowledge of fashion sometimes because whatever she was wearing, it was actually great. I mean, it struck me as a little, it was certainly a little over the top for Sun Valley, but it was great. It was white. It was thick black brushstrokes sort of reminiscent of like a Picasso sketch and, and it was excellent. And unfortunately, I feel the Getty photographers did not capture it. No, they did. I mean, I, you got to love it. She's just, she's so wacky. It's really fun. I thought Oprah looked really good. She is wearing white head to toe Phoebe Filo, which is, is big in, in the fashion industry, a big deal that she wore that when it comes to the guys. I mean, the guy that I thought looked good is this, the on running founder, because he just has like a, he had like a blue shirt on and he looked very casual. But why do you think they all like make such an effort? And, and is this, is this a newer thing or, or have you seen the, an evolution over the last few years? I, well, first of all, it's so funny that you mentioned the on running founder because one thing I noticed and I will concede that I like, I took a few minutes to look around and be like, what am I going to notice here to tell Lauren? But so many people are wearing his shoes. It's really like the, the, the, I would say that the average, the average attendee who's wearing sneakers, or I'd say that I guess a plurality of people who are, who are wearing sneakers, certainly like the women with the polo and the white pants look so many on running shoes. So that was definitely something I picked up on the evolution. I think, you know, look, on the one hand, there are certain people who are never going to evolve. Palantir CEO, Alex Karp shows up in his like cycling outfit and has no qualms about walking around in like cycling shorts and the cycling shirt. There, there are a lot of people here for whom like they will never change out of the polo and the khakis, but I do think that there is a sense that, you know, you see someone like an Eiger showing up with a little attention to detail. You, and I think over time you sort of think, well, maybe I should try a little bit harder, right? Maybe, and it's not, it's never going to be, I don't think we're going to, I don't think I'm going to come back here in two or three years and there are going to be 10 Stacey's, but I do think there's going to be a little bit more care to like the accents and the flourishes and a little less frumpy. And certainly that's not true among everyone. Like I saw Reid Hoffman walking through here the other day and like that, that guy's never going to take off his like oversized black sneakers and ill fitting khakis, but like he doesn't have to. I mean, I mean, ultimately the biggest power statement you can make here is sort of wearing whatever the fuck you want to wear because that, you know, you didn't get rich by spending too much time stressing the wardrobe. Yeah, I think that that's a great way to end it. Dylan, thank you for joining me. Hopefully you can come back on sometime to Tuck Konde. Would always love to. Thanks for having me, Lauren.

So first off, what'd you have for breakfast? I had an apple, a honey crisp, out of season, but still good and peanut butter. Sounds delicious. Yeah, it just never gets old. It doesn't. I like some fruit and nut, good protein to complex car balance in the morning. Yeah, what did you have? I had scrambled eggs and a piece of toast, which is if I am having breakfast like my go-to. Sometimes I mix in a little arugula in the scrambled eggs. Oh, that's nice. Yeah, but I didn't this morning because I'm definitely going to have salad for a bunch. I'm going to just keep it easy. So we are here to talk about Gen Z more broadly and youth culture even more broadly, because you have become, through your newsletter after school, previously you had another newsletter and just your work as a journalist, an expert in youth culture. Thing about fashion marketers, as you know, is they're obsessed with like, what do the youth want? What do the youth want? What do young people want to buy? How do we get young people hooked into our brand even if they can't afford what we sell? Everybody, every brand is chasing young people. And so what you do with after school, your newsletter is sort of go through all the different trends young people are following or making and how young people interact with brands. I find it really interesting because I don't really think about young people that much. So it's helpful for me to do my job. You make that easier. And that's what honestly a great business newsletter should do is help people do their job better. But also, it's kind of just offers really good insight into where culture is moving. How did you make this your niche? Like where did you always want to get into journalism? Like what got you from there to here? So my first summer in New York, I think was the summer of 2008. And I was interning at Teen Vogue. I grew up obsessed with teen magazines. I'm from a small town in Missouri. And you know, everyone says like magazines are my lifeline. And that is definitely true for me. And I, in addition to interning at Teen Vogue, I also was working for this website, Y-Pulse, which is one of the early day sort of youth consultancies. And I got into the fold of Teen Vogue and Y-Pulse because I had a fashion blog when I was a teenager before Tavi Gibbonson. But mine was far worse. I think she started in 09 or 10. Mine was truly terrible. I was a teenager in Missouri. But it was nice because it did serve sort of as a resume and sort of the same that for now it's like start a sub stack or something. But so I was just really interested in tracking trends at that point. But I was a youth then. And it's funny because I've been reflecting on that summer of 2008 this year because I've been in New York now like 15 years full time. And just thinking about how remarkably, how my interests are the same. Like I was so young then and now I'm like still just like, well, what are the young people doing? Except back then it was like literally my peers. And now it's definitely not my peers. But so, so started there, study journalism, worked at Teen Vogue full time, worked at MTV for a bit, started a newsletter that was basically the skim for teens. But as I sort of got older, my interest in trying to speak to young people became less of a fascination for me. And what became more interesting was helping brands speak to young people. Your newsletter for teens, what was it called? It was called Clover Letter. Oh, Clover Letter. Yes. I was a subscriber and you all sold it to awesomeness? Yeah, it was on it. My friend, we remained friends. Liza Darwin was an editor at Nylon at the time. I was an editor at Teen Vogue. We quit our jobs. It was during like Hillary Clinton is going to be president, rah rah, feminism. And so we grew that to like 200,000 teen subscribers sold it to awesomeness TV, who then was sold to Viacom, which was all within a span of a few months. Who was behind awesomeness? Was it um? Brian Robbins. Oh, Brian Robbins, the pop patrol and head of the class. Yes. Okay. So Brian Robbins was the awesomeness TV guy. That's really interesting. Did they reach out to you to like, were they like, we want to just acquire your newsletter? Were they interested? Do you think in your mailing list, like how did that happen? So Liza and I had grown it quite a bit. It was a lot of work. It was a daily newsletter. And one of the, you know, maker break stats for newsletter is your open rate. But what we learned is that an open rate is really hard to maintain with teenagers because their student emails turn over. So we're just constantly this uphill battle. And at a certain point we were like, do we try and raise? But media wasn't looking good at that time by 2018. It's like, we're even worse now. But so we started having conversations with a bunch of different people. And we had conversations with people that you would imagine. And they seemed like the sort of best. They were looking for sort of like more of a authentic, like real girl platform. So yeah, they wanted the mailing list, I think first and foremost, of course, when Viacom then acquired them, I think they had no use for this mailing list. So those 200,000 emails just sit unused somewhere. Well, I bet a lot of them now subscribed to after school. I do get that sometimes, which is really like, because they've grown up. Yeah, exactly. So you, you did this newsletter, you sold it. And then what did you do? Did you go work in venture capital right after that? Or did you consult for a while? Or I had a real moment of like, holy shit, what do I, because I really always wanted to be like a teen magazine editor. And then after the Clover Letter experience, it just came clear to me that that what teen magazines hardly existed at that point. And it was an experience that was great. But I wanted to sort of explore something else. I went to New York magazine and was working at The Strategist. I did some some fun teen shopping stories there. Then the pandemic hit. So I was editing like, what is the best vacuum cleaner for when you have a dog, you know, that kind of stuff, which is a very good service journalism. Yes, The Strategist is really well done. It's the best. And that team is wonderful. And like Alexis has incredible taste. Like what she's done for her was amazing. But after a year of that, I really missed the sort of teen, centra or youth trend stuff. So I left that job and I started after school truly for myself, because I was like reading all this stuff and thinking like I wanted to maybe freelance and do some consulting. But I wanted a place to track all these micro trends and so many things were happening by that time. I started in 2019, I think. And TikTok was, you know, up and coming. And it just felt like every day there was like this like barrage of new trends. And no, you know, Google search is terrible. So I wanted to track them somewhere. So I did after school for a month and didn't tell anybody I did it every day to see if it was like a sustainable thing that I got, you know, something out of and I did. And so I've been doing it every day for like three years now. It's amazing. So we're going to talk a lot more about after school, but I want to rewind for a second. Why do you think you're so obsessed with youth culture? Like what do you think it is about when you were growing up? And I would want to also talk about I would want to also talk about how you think youth culture has changed in the last 20 years. But what is your personal sort of connection? And why do you want to keep because your audience has changed? It went from being teenagers to being people who want to make money off of teenagers. So what what is it for you? It's kind of for me, like I'm just obsessed with why rich people spend their money the way they spend it. Like my youth culture is rich people culture. But I'm curious from your perspective, like, why does it never get old for you? It's a great question. I think because so young people are figuring out their identity. So they're trying on so many different, you know, from clothes to music to, you know, they're to downloading apps, they're in very much an exploratory phase. It's always been that way. And I think so much is born from these young people who are trying to figure out their identities, like they're time bows on things. Or you know, there's just like so many weird micro trends that come out of people just trying to figure out who they are and what speaks to them, whether it's Coquette Core or like Alt Goth. Wait, what's Coquette Core? I don't know about that. Coquette Core. Do you know that one? Coquette Core makes more sense. I was like, what is Coquette Core? Coquette Core will probably be the next trending aesthetic. But yeah, I just think, you know, I don't have any, I don't have kids, I don't have like young people in my life. But and I think that actually makes it even better for me to research it because I have a little bit of distance. So I spend a ton of time on TikTok. But it's for my research purposes. So I don't feel the sort of like social negatives that come from spending too much time on social media. But yeah, I think it's similar to you where it's like, it's very much a social observer, you know, and I think as a journalist and as a reporter, it's just so fun to find that niche that sort of like scratches the itch of curiosity. For sure. The social observer point and the idea of like, you're doing this because it's your job and not because you want to be enmeshed in it, it does make it easier. Yes. Like you, it's easier. I don't harbor any resentment against any of the rich people I write about. I love them. Yeah, exactly, Lauren. And I think for me too, it's like tracking all these trends. I'm old enough that I don't feel like I need to buy into them, which gives me a lot of like, I think when my own wardrobe, it's like, I don't give a shit about these micro trends. It's more of a, you know, I want to understand the deeper meaning of why people, young people are gravitating towards these things. So let's break down exactly what happened in the trend cycle over the last 20 years, because you keep talking about these micro trends. Coquette, what is it? Coquette core. Coquette core. So is that just like super cute and like a little sexy or something? A lot of bows. Okay. A lot of bows. Yeah, I got it. It's interesting because a lot of these micro trends, not all of them, but feel, it feels like the way Japanese culture manages trends. It's sort of connected to that, but that could be a whole other podcast. Explain to me how trend, the trend cycle has changed in the last 20 years and the factors involved. I assume the consumption of media changing has changed the trend cycle, but curious to know from your perspective. From my perspective, you know, thinking about this from a 20 year POV 20 years ago is 16. And my sort of purview of trends was truly like, Atucer Rubenstein said that we're all wearing this for back to school. Like my trends, like trends were informed by magazine editors and their perspectives were formed by what fashion designers put down the run, sent down the runway the previous season, right? Or that's my understanding of as a kid, you know, how trends kind of came into fruition. It was very much like from the designer and then the retailer and then the fashion editors sort of took their cues both from, you know, their, their like intense trend books that they made. And now it's like, I really feel like fashion editors or editors broadly were the gatekeepers and not in a bad way. I don't mean gatekeeping and with the negative connotations, but they were the ones who were making those decisions for us. And now it's like you totally removed them. And now it almost feels like in many cases and obviously, you know better, you know, some of these luxury designers who really are creating culture are a different case, but a lot of designers are just taking their cues from TikTok and taking their cues from the people who are creating culture. Now it's young people basically. And to think about a fashion, to think about a Teen Vogue editor having the power to make a trend now, that simply is not the case, you know. And I think current day trend reporting is a whole other thing that I could talk to you about forever because SEO, all of these things inform trend reporting. But I think the trend cycle has collapsed and has been turned on its head in many ways where it's like the people, some cool girl, you know, internet deemed cool girl could wear one specific dress tomorrow on a TikTok. And people could order it on TikTok immediately and they could have it within two days. And then suddenly everyone is uploading TikToks of themselves wearing this one specific dress, then that dress is sold out. Then Marie Claire and Glamour and all these people are writing about this sold out dress. So then the sort of mainstream consumer wants it too. I mean, it's just like the amount of power that TikTok has, I think is astounding. I trace this sort of bottom up trend cycle acceleration back to Marc Jacobs grunge collection, which when you look back, like that trend was really big on the street or whatever already. But and he famously, Marc Jacobs did this Perielis grunge collection, grunge collection for Perielis, this brand he was designing for famously got fired afterwards. And it got it like the Susie Minkie's like slammed it, like a lot of the big, big critics slammed it in a time when you didn't really slam collections. It was more about actually telling people what the clothes looked like, but many of the fashion critics were negative on it. He got fired. And then in the end, you look back and it was it was really revolutionary because he took something from the street, like very directly from the street. Other designers had obviously done that and Saint Laurent, when he started doing ready to wear and not just couture, that that probably is even the an earlier example 30 years before that. But the Marc Jacobs grunge, and I remember he also did looney tune characters. I think they were a part of that grunge collection and that trickled back down to Kmart. Because I remember I wanted like I was wearing like flannel shirts and I wanted some sort of looney tunes thing. And that had come from he probably saw it on the street, designed it, and then it trickled back down. So it was this sort of back and forth. And the other thing was high street or mass market stores, they were not fast fashion. And it wasn't quick, like you're saying on TikTok, you can buy something and order it. You could see something and order it the next day and have it. This stuff took six months or a year or whatever. So the cycle is just so much longer. But I really do trace it back to that moment when Marc Jacobs sort of said, that's where the real stuff is coming from is the street. And so, and you saw that more and more in fashion for the next 20 years. And when 2008, 2009, when the internet really took over and style.com made it so that you could just see images and fast fashions are H&M were so proliferating all over the world. It just made it made the whole top down gatekeeping thing totally irrelevant. Do you feel like the flattening of all this stuff and the popularity of TikTok and it is wild to me to see these publications glom onto a TikTok trend the way they used to glom onto a celebrity photo? Or you'd have to post every photo of every Kardashian because it did really well traffic wise. Now I feel like TikTok trends have weirdly replaced that. There is a lot of talk about a lack of a monoculture. And we look at these big retailers challenged because they can't sort of tap into the zeitgeist like they used to. I'd love to talk to you about Gap specifically because I know you buy Gap clothing and I'm curious to know what you think about all their marketing. But what do you see for fashion brands now that people are consuming the way that they're consuming and these really like micro bites of information and they are, there isn't a sort of go to retailer or a go to look anymore. How do you see brands adapting to that new way of consuming? Well, I think Gap is an interesting example because back in the day they had a very specific, I don't want to use this word because it's so overused, but they had a very specific aesthetic where it was like you knew what you were going to get at the Gap and they changed from season to season, but the basics were so good and so consistent and they had a point of view. And now I find I still look at their site every few weeks and they lack a point of view just in such a jarring way. And I was just reading an article, I can't remember who was writing about Richard. It maybe was Business of Fashion, it maybe was Wall Street Journal, but you know how they both just had them. Okay, have they finally turned things around and something jumped out at me as thinking like this is exactly not what they should be focused on. I think we're seeing them react to culture and try to engage, but when you go to their website, their clothes, the Doan collection I think was okay. It was a win for them. And it was a big win for Doan. Yes. I'm really happy for them. I think that they do an incredible job with that business. It's really remarkable. Someone should buy it. I think to get Doan to the masses, I think that was a great win for them. But you go to the website and it's your scene stuff that has, is like watered down any clothes that you're seeing on, you know, they have low-rise jeans, but they also have high-rise skinny jeans and they have overalls, but they also have just horrible dresses and there's just absolutely no consistency or point of view whatsoever. And I hope that Richard, you know, is working on that and there's whispers that he is bringing in fresh like design talent, right? But as it stands, it feels like they're just purely reacting to things that are trending in the zeitgeist. And Tyler included, like, I think she's great, but she's to my perspective is like, she's neither, she's not big enough to bring in the masses. You know, my parents would look at her and think that she was just a model, which is fine, she's beautiful, but that's not really the point. And I also don't think she's necessarily someone that you could believe shops at Gap. Whereas back in the day, when they had all these wonderful celebrity campaigns, the styling was so good. Oh, I thought of the anecdote. They mentioned that they have made themselves more relevant to young people with their their merchandising and their styling. And their example was that they had styled a hoodie with Sombas. And it's like, I know, I know, but that was like their proud moment that I know. And so it's like, guys, this is exactly the problem. Like you think you're doing something, but you don't get it. Like this is all wrong. So I worry about them. I think that they can do it. But I really, I don't know. I, this is the issue. There are definitely people at that company that know that's all wrong. But when you are that big of a company, what ends up happening is that also these retailers don't attract the sort of creative business talent that they did 30 years ago because it's not as fun of a job. So and you don't make as much as money and all that stuff in the same picture. You have to live in San Francisco. You have to live in San Francisco. My, and I want to talk about them versus Gap versus Abercrombie after this, but my, my analysis so far, and I've said this to people who work at Gap Inc, who have been like, he's doing everything you say he should be doing. Why are you so critical? And the thing is like, I've literally been through five CEOs, they all do the same thing. They all cost cut, cut costs and do a really good job at cutting costs. And then they, um, they cut costs and then they change a little bit of the marketing or merchandising. If you remember when Art Peck was there, he did the red jeans and they did super well. That was like 2011 when everyone had red jeans. It's a, it's a tie happens, right? Oh yeah. Yeah. It was just like everybody had jeans. Like that was his one thing he did really well and that, and everyone gets excited and then the numbers start to lag because you can only cost cut costs so much. And I do think Richard is different. He's collaborative. I believe he knows what he doesn't know. And so he hires people around him. Is he hiring? The question is, is he, he already athletic, the biggest, they have the biggest opportunity at, at athletic, their active wear brand. He already, he hired someone from Nike, which could be great. Nike has a very particular corporate culture and people who leave after being there for 20 years often have a hard time. So I'm curious to see what happens there, but I really think the team at Athleta is good and they have a lot of opportunity. He will have something at Old Navy. I've heard the, the design director's amazing. And so, and Zach Posin's been deeply involved at Old Navy, but has kind of stayed away from the design part and more focused on the marketing. So maybe they'll keep that person because she is, she has like a stellar reputation, but Gap brand is the most important thing. And I agree that it's either you, if you want to, this is a brand that you, it can't just be that you're trying to attract young people. And if that's what you're trying to do, it has to be really, really sharp. And someone like Tyler, that's cool. That's like complimentary, but that can't be the driving force. And also, I do think people want something to have a point of view. And your point of view can be that you are super on trend, like Abercrombie. But then you have to do it so well that that is what you are all about. And there, there is an opportunity to be somewhere that feels like it's for everyone that's a go to, there's nowhere where I'm like, Oh, I get all my t-shirts from here. I just bought a bunch of t-shirts from Los Angeles Apparel. So I was like, Oh, I totally forgot about that. That still exists. It might as well. Like Dove Charney occasionally is living in the factory. It might as well support his efforts. Yeah, I've had either dresses and I like them. They're nice. It's nice cotton. Yeah. I mean, they're really well done. They're made in the USA. Yes. USA. He's a very complicated character. I'm not, I'm not endorsing him, but I think he makes good product anyway. But he's never going to be Gap. Everlane is not going to be Gap. Uniclo is sort of Gap for certain people, but they, their marketing is a hindrance to that in the US. But you look at it's, what you described to me of, of what's on, on the site at Gap, it sounds, sort of sounds like what Abercrombie is doing, but Abercrombie is doing it really successfully. So what is the difference between the Abercrombie strategy and why is that working so well with young consumers versus the Gap strategy? So I think Abercrombie has really thrived with millennials and elder Gen Zers. They have, they have figured out how to win over what maybe 15 years ago, first job, trying to figure out how to do, you know, corporate casuals, I would maybe go to Anteiler loft. I mean, Anteiler loft was never cool, but you know, millennials and elder Gen Zers are not good. Does Anteiler loft even still exist? I know it does, but I can't even picture. I think they stopped calling it that or remember they had Luan Gray also, which was like the cool casual brand. Yes. I think they stopped calling them all or something like that. But yes, no loft still exists. Okay. So Abercrombie has figured out how to, they are special occasion, but they're also corporate casual. And what's interesting with these sort of, you know, young women who are, you know, working their working women, they, they love those blazers, they love those trousers, and they're wearing them out too. So they've really figured out how to, to do the nine to five and then drinks or date or, you know, that sort of uniform. And the price is right. The quality is okay. The fabrics aren't great, but I also think that consumer doesn't care. To me, they figured out how to do the Reformation Girl at a, at a more accessible price point. And I also think that they are targeting millennials who grew up with them, grew up remembering them as being very exclusive, not friendly, not, you can't sit with us. And now they're very accessible. They're very inclusive. And I think that appeals to the millennials who maybe felt like it wasn't for them back in the day or, and also the millennials who liked it back in the day. There's like the nostalgia factor where it's Abercrombie. And I also think there's like what I see on TikTok and just among my own friends of like, can you believe this is from Abercrombie kind of like, the jeans especially, oh, they're from, and they're so affordable. Oh, can you, can you believe it? Yes. Yes. I haven't stepped foot in one. I was shopping on Sixth Avenue running Aaron's last Friday, two Fridays ago. And I saw it, there's a one on Sixth Avenue now near Flatiron. And I thought I had to make some returns at Gap because I, I optimistically ordered some stuff. It was all terrible. And I sort of like peered at the Abercrombie for a second, like do I? I just didn't, I couldn't do it. I didn't have it at me. But I, so I think that younger millennials than me, elder Gen Zers, they are the ones who are flocking. And would you say that the merchandising strategy is just like a lot sharper than, than Gap? Yes. Yes. It's just, I mean, I can picture what their website merchandising looks like in my, and I bet you it's almost like a mall version of Reformation where it's like linen dresses in some soft florals. The models are pretty and, and sort of friendly looking. And then the blazers, teas, low slung linen pants, like, and I bet if you pull it up, that's exactly what it looks like. Totally. I literally just Googled it and the shopping thing is all of, a linen, oh, this dress is very cute. A linen, this is a little denim vest dress that's $66. Oh, yes. I looked at that dress. This is adorable. I thought about ordering it. I would, yeah, I would wear that. I'm pretty anti-vest in my own life, but I, the vest dress is, is interesting. Are you feeling overwhelmed with all the supplements out there? Totally get it. There's a lot of misinformation and fake claims. That's why Groon's took the time to understand proper dosing to ensure nutrition is optimized and safe. Groon's utilizes a convenient comprehensive formula that is designed to replace the multiple supplements you take a day. This isn't a multivitamin, a greens gummy, or a prebiotic. Groon's is all of those things and then some at a fraction of the price and the taste is fabulous. Visit groon's.co to get up to 52% off. That's groon's.co. I have a friend. Do you know David Marks? Yes. I don't know him personally, but I follow him on Twitter. Yeah. Okay. So David Marks is this writer. He's based in Japan. He's lived there for, I don't know, 30 years or something crazy like that. He writes about men's fashion mostly, but also trends. His first book was called Amitura. It was about the Japanese adoption of American preppy clothing and then the American adoption of the Japanese version of American preppy clothing. So Japanese selvedge denim is the clear example of this. I love it. It's a great book. I recommend it to everybody. Then he wrote this book called Status and Culture, which is about essentially how our consumption habits are all about showing our status. Really interesting. David's like a couple years older than me. So all of his references, you would like it because the references are just all pop culture things that even you being, you're probably 10 years younger than you would still be into it from that perspective. And now he's writing another book. I don't know where I'll just say what it is, but you're going to really be interested in the topic. But anyway, he's a very interesting, I love him. My husband and I are both good friends with him. He's an interesting character. Once I messaged him probably five years ago, I said, what do you think about this whole that preppy being so trendy? And he wrote me like 5,000 words about how preppy is not a trend and blah, blah, blah, whatever. But he has this theory. I saw him when he was in Paris for the men's show. So we got to hang out a lot, which was really nice. But he has this theory that like the generation thing is BS. He doesn't believe in these delineated generations. I tried to get him to explain what he meant. I think what he means is like the culture changes. And so everybody's attitude change, but he doesn't believe it's sort of pinpointed to generations. And as someone who studies youth culture and you've studied it through several generations at this point, three or four generations, would you agree with that? Can you pinpoint Gen Z people or millennial people and see their habits still? The millennials 10 years ago, do those traits still apply to them today? Or what do you think of this idea that the generation delineations is kind of BS and used simply for marketers to make their jobs easier? I think it's really hard to make generalizations. For instance, Gen Z right now, the oldest are like 27 to 28. The youngest are anyway, depending on who is defining it anywhere from 12 to 14. So we're talking about very different life stages here. So just absolutely impossible to make any sort of generalizations about these people. And I also think not to make it about COVID, but I do think COVID, you know, so many people staying at home for elementary elementary school, middle school, high school, college, just having these fundamental life sort of rites of passage just disappear or change in a very big way. I think that that will inform these sort of, I don't want to say micro generations, but you know, a 12 year old 12 to 15 year olds have more in common than and 15 to, you know, so I think when I think about millennials, I'm like, yeah, we can probably make some generalizations about us and same for Xers. But as technology changes people's lives in such a dramatic way, I think it's going to get harder and harder to make these generalizations. Because for instance, like TikTok really does have such a big impact on all generations right now, but especially Gen Z because they're so in it. And but what about the Gen Zers that are slightly older and maybe didn't grow up with it as much? So I think it's impossible to make those generalizations. I do think that ages are a helpful sort of milestone to think about in terms of like as marketers, because it is likely that 15 year olds and 17 year olds have a lot in common and want the same things from social media want brands to talk to them in the same way. But it's really hard to think about a 27 year old and a 14 year old being interested in the same things. There are two generational ideas that I think are you can attribute to the passage of time or what have you changing. And one is this idea of selling out that feels so it feels definitely the generation before ours like definitely Gen X and this idea of you don't want to do things if they're too commercially driven, etc, etc. And do you see that with young people at all? Because it completely went away with millennials. I think I'm at the tip top of the and I do believe in this stuff. And I consider myself very much a millennial. I'm not Gen X. But I feel the selling out thing occasionally I wouldn't I wouldn't indulge it. I understand that feeling of like, I don't want to do that that feels like too pandering or whatever. I feel like that totally went away with the millennial generation. Is there any sense of integrity or any of that stuff with this generation in terms of like, I don't want to do something because it's not right or it's it's for the wrong reasons. I'm not in this to make money like all of that does is any of that run is resonating with them and if so, in what way? On one hand, I think we're seeing some anti-corporation ethos sort of rise up in the way that they conduct themselves, how they expect a workplace to be. They don't believe that they should work from nine to nine, which many of us early in our career is you know, I had unreasonable hours, but didn't have the vocabulary or the the sort of didn't feel empowered to do anything about it. And so on one hand, yes, but at the same time, I think because so many of them aspire to be creators, the idea of selling out is different. So you know, if they see Alex Earl hawking KFC, they're not going to say, you know, what a sellout, they'll say get that bad girl. And they understand that in order for their favorite creators to continue showing up in their FYPs, that they need to make money. I do think something interesting happens when a creator that they relate to suddenly is a millionaire and buying real estate and living a life where they're on a private jet where it's sort of like, hey, we want to support you, but we don't want to support you that much. So there is going to be I think an interesting sort of reckoning that happens where it's like, you can sell out to an extent. But when you're, for example, Sophia Richie, and you have literally 30 brand deals for what end like what and so then I think that when when someone, I mean, I think she would be considered a sellout in many ways, but then she loses consumer trust. But does she care about consumer trust? Are consumers are young consumers loyal to brands in any way? Or does that or is it for like a short period of time? Because it feels like in many ways, people will say there's no more brand loyalty. There's no more, you can't you're not going to have a brand, an affinity for a brand for 20 years, like you used to or the way we all feel about gap and we want gap to succeed. Like, do young people feel that way? Do they get emotionally attached to brands in the same way that they used to? In my research, they do love brands. They love brands like a friend. I think we see this play out with Glossier, which Glossier is a little bit more millennial, but is obviously also very popular with Gen Z. So they have a sense of brand loyalty. But if their brand does something, a brand they like does something that they don't support, and that could be a partnership that they think is lame, that could be greenwashing, that could be any number of things, any sort of cancelable offense, then they won't think twice about they will not stay loyal. But I also at the same time, there's something interesting happening with young people where they're trying more brands than ever. There's some like recent morning console data that Gen Z is trying so many more brands than any other generation every month because there's so many more brand launches. There's just the amount of products to try. And I think also their opportunity to try these brands is so much higher, where it's like me growing up in Missouri, I really, what I could try was quite limited. Like the Walmart and the Next Townover, that's kind of it. But now because they can, with online shopping, with freebies, with TikTok shop, the stakes are so much lower to experiment with brands that they are sort, you know, it's not like they're like, well, I love Glossier mascara, so I'm just going to stick with Glossier mascara. No, they're going to try others. But so it comes down to Glossier to continuously like pull them back in. What are some brands that Gen Zers are really into right now that some of the fashion people listenership might not know about? A lot of people watch the Brandy Melville documentary, but I think, you know, controversy aside, young people like Brandy Melville. And I think many of the same reasons we loved Gap growing up where it's like they, the styles do not really change from season to season. It's one very specific aesthetic. They're good basics, and it's a really good price point. Now there are some things like the one size fits all, which a lot, you know, they've gotten lots of backlash and the documentary, like it's not a great company, but they're, as far as like a quality brand goes, an enjoyable retail experience goes, they're really nailing it. And I think that's why like the documentary that a lot of millennials adults watch, probably thought that that would be the end of Brandy Melville. And it's on my FYP as much as it ever was girls are shopping there as much as they ever were. So I think that's a big one. Where was I was just in Europe. I want to say in Oslo, there was a Brandy Melville. Like I was in Oslo, Paris, and Milan. And I think in Oslo, there was a Brandy Melville and we were like, wow. And let me just tell you, Oslo is not the most fashionable place in the world. It's kind of like how that happened. Yeah, that is that is interesting. I didn't know that they were international. Actually, let me, they're definitely internet. Let me just check this to make sure I but I swear it was in of all places. Oslo. Yeah. Oslo, Norway. Huh. On a street that Bogstad, Vian, Bogstad, Vian or something like that. Yeah, it's there. Did it look the same as all the others? Exactly. I love that. Yeah, it was very, they even have their own Instagram page. Another brand that comes to mind that maybe the fashion people aren't aware of, and I'm not saying that they necessarily should be, but there's a brand called Garage that really reminds me of like Delias or Alloy back in the day, very similar aesthetic. And I first heard about it on, I do this thing, or I've done this thing for a couple of years where I watched like a thousand Christmas gift halls, which are if for those unfamiliar girls go through everything they got for Christmas and hold it up. I got these, I got these, and girls all got these garage cargoes. They all got gift certificates to garage. It's a mall store. It's in tons of, there's tons of locations, but until I spent a lot of time on TikTok, I was totally unaware of it. Wow. Yeah, I've never heard of this, but I'm having a great time looking at it. Oh man, I love Delias so much. It really like throws me back looking at Garage. It yeah, Delias is, I think, is ripe for comeback. I do too. It was so such a big part of seventh grade for me. And the catalogs, I spent some time trying to dig up Delias scans or like any sort of digital archive of them because the floaties, flip flops I was trying to find in a Delias. And the sad thing about Delias, Alloy, all of these, you know, these catalogs and these brands is there really is no digital archive of them. It's a bummer. Too bad. Someone owns Delias now. Maybe like some licensing firm, maybe they'll do, they'll try to make a comeback like and like limited to. They're probably owned by the same people. Yeah, probably. Another, I guess, a final question for you. Since you grew up wanting to work in magazines, then you worked in magazines and then you had a new, I mean, newsletters are not a new thing, but you, you made a business out of a newsletter long before Substack existed. And now you're doing another newsletter and I assume you do some consulting and things like that on the side. Does Gen Z or even the generation below Gen Z, Gen Alpha or whatever, it ends up being called? I hope it's not Gen Alpha. That would be so dumb. But how can media brands interact with, with those consumers? Because they don't, everything is so fragmentation of culture. I mean, I say that fragmented word probably 15 times a week and either in Linecheat or on this podcast, it feels so, how do you, it doesn't, I bought a bunch of magazines. I was in Europe and I had a 12 hour flight and I was like, I'm going to buy, I bought Confect. I bought British L and British Bazaar. British L was pretty good. Like it still had great, great articles in it, really interesting ideas. Confect, which is the, it's, do you know this magazine? It's owned by Monocle and it's for women. So it's like the Monocle for women, which in the, if you were going to make a magazine for Lauren Sherman, like this is exactly the magazine. It's really snobby. It's based in Northern, in Zurich, like everything else, Monocle. It's like very Northern European or East, or like Central European vibes. A lot of pictures of mountains, really nicely, beautifully done food photos with wine recommendations, whatever. Like it's like exactly my thing. I find it so boring. Every, all the brands, every single brand they mention, every single brand in all the fashion shoots, all stuff that I either wear or want to wear. Like it is just the most boring magazine in the whole world. And I bought it at the airport and just left it for someone because I was like, this is so, so boring, but I am 42 years old and I can engage with them. So, and, and a lot of media, I mean, my media, again, very fractured in terms of, of how I consume it. How are they consuming it? And looking back on your own consumption habits in media, when you were a teenager, we were talking before we started rolling about fashionista, where I used to work and you read when you were in college. How can media companies engage with, with this audience? That is such a good question, Lauren. I mean, I, part of the reason why after Clover, or why Liza and I, it was time to move on is because it really is truly so hard to engage with this audience and becoming, I mean, since we, since 2018, when we sold the company, it has become so much more difficult to engage with this audience. I wouldn't start a newsletter aimed at Gen Z, although many of them read my sub, read, not just mine, read substacks. And, you know, I think we're seeing with Byline, you know, people are interested in exploring print and articles. It's so funny. I, I have a Gen Z friend who has a substack and she said, she left me a voice memo, which I think very Gen Z to leave a voice note, but she said, you know, I read so many newsletters. I had this idea of like, what if there's one website with all of these different newsletter voices? And I, but she can't be the only other Gen Zer thinking that and having not experienced like the rise of like XO Jane or Gawker or like, you know, bundling of newsletter. Like it was just such a funny like Gen Z POV of like how they don't, they didn't grow up with the media that we grew up with. And therefore they're thinking about things completely differently. But I, you know, we saw a couple of years ago, there was like, the rise of like Vogue magazine for Gen Z on TikTok. And it was, it was by an agency. It doesn't exist anymore. Like these people are trying to take these sort of like Vogue magazine and translate it to TikTok. And that's just not how people consume media. And I think media budgets are so limited now that there's not even enough budget to explore how you could get some of this input. I think NPR's TikTok is sort of a gold standard of like, this is how we can make our content, you know, deliver it against different platforms. But I think at the end of the day, brands, media companies, anybody that wants to engage with young people, they need to have a digital strategy for each platform. And they need to try a lot of different shit. Like they need to be okay trying a lot. But I think the hard part there is it is such a big investment. And there's no like cheat or shortcut. If you walked into a fashion brand's headquarters, let's go luxury, luxury brands headquarters tomorrow, and they were paying you, I don't know, $500 an hour at least, I don't know what your rate is, it should be at least that, to tell them how to work and engage this audience, which is maybe not buying their stuff directly just yet, or just buying the entry level, but they want to cultivate them into being future customers. Like, what would be your, your biggest piece of advice to them? Well, I think what Mark Jacobs has done with his TikTok is the biggest example of what, what young people want from any brand, whether it's a luxury brand or not. And for those unfamiliar, Mark Jacobs TikTok basically finds viral stars, niche viral stars, puts them in Mark Jacobs' clothes and has them do what they are, you know, do their thing basically. And the thing that my Mark Jacobs really gets right is how quickly they do it. They execute on it extremely quickly. And I think that is the hardest part for brands to engage with internet culture is they don't have the infrastructure in place to do things quickly. There's too much red tape. Mark Jacobs, I don't know how they do it. They, but I, my number one piece of advice is like young people want to, they want something that they can sink their teeth into in terms of personality or again, point of view from a brand where it's like the Reformation is another great example where it's like they're actually engaging with the audience, they're speaking their language, and they're a little weird. And I think Gen Z is a little dark and a little weird. They're very, you know, the humor is a big part of what they, what, how they sort of deal with things. And I think they really respect brands that sort of speak that back to them. Starface is another example. Their social media is so weird, but people love it because it, you know, they're kind of speaking their language. So it's really figuring out like, who are we at? What is our personality? That's a really hard thing for big corporations to do, I think, you know, but they need to let their social teams figure out who they are. Richard Dixon, you need to call Casey Lewis.
