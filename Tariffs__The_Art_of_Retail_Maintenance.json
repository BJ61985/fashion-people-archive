Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Puck's Fashion and Beauty Memo Line Sheet. And today with me on the show is retail real estate guru Jonathan Schley. We're talking Prada Versace, Terefmania, Glossier's Downround, and plenty more. Hi everyone, hope you are having a great week. I am actually on vacation this week. I'm in Tokyo with my family. So the next few episodes are going to be a little bit more evergreen than usual because I'm chilling out. This week on Line Sheet, I've got some details on the state of Louis Vuitton's factory in Texas, which has faced plenty foreseeable challenges since its opening in 2019. I thought the Reuters story on the factory and its struggles was really good, but at the same time maybe not understanding what the point of the factory is. So I got into that in my piece. It's worth reading both of them, I think. I also have an update on the search for the next editor of Vanity Fair, and I also did an unscientific survey on the best running tights with pockets. The answers may surprise you. Sarah Shapiro takes a look at Love Shack Fancy and analyzes whether their licensing strategy is working. I personally think of Love Shack Fancy as sort of shabby chic meets Betsy Johnson's situation, and I assume licensing is the way to go as they inevitably lose their luster with tweens and teens. You can't be cool forever with that crew, especially when that crew becomes young adults who think it's super tacky to wear Love Shack Fancy and any skirts. Anyway, enjoy, and I will be back with a quick update for you on Friday. Jonathan Schley, welcome to Fashion People. Thanks, Lauren. Thanks for having me. So before we get started, this is a news day, so we're going to just run through a bunch of interesting topics that I know you have an opinion on. But maybe you can... I met you years ago through the journalist Misty Whitesidell, who has actually been a guest on this podcast and writes a lot for the New York Times at the moment, but she was working at WWD at the time, I think, and intro'd us because your background is super unique. You are a retail real estate person advisor, and then you also have done a lot of writing yourself, especially about cars for the likes of Heist and Abiety, et cetera. But how did you get into the fashion business? So I mean, I sort of reject saying I'm in the fashion business. I am a senior vice president at CBRE for what we call Retail Advisory and Transaction Services, which is a really long-winded way of saying a real estate broker, but primarily work with brands in the luxury apparel beauty home space, et cetera, focusing on their retail strategies globally. And how I got into that was quite randomly actually. I started in hospitality at Ace Hotel, as you know, or I should say for one of the owners of Ace Hotel, focused on the retail in those projects, in physical spaces in those projects. So I've always sort of approached those relationships in a more brand partnerships way than a transactional real estate broker way, I would say, and then sort of accidentally became a real estate broker after those, after that, mainly after the project in downtown LA, which was when you and I first met. So. Got it. At some point, for another podcast, not for fashion people, but the ownership structure of hotels is so fascinating. We cannot get into it right now, but the Ace Hotel in particular, I just stayed at the one in Brooklyn. And this is like my husband and I talk about the ownership structure of hotels for like hours. It's so fascinating. Very complicated and very differentiated, especially geographically. So. Yeah, but if you all have ever been, is the Ace Hotel still in downtown LA or is that, is that still an Ace? No. I think sadly not. Yeah. Yeah. I used to stay there before I lived in LA. This, there was an Ace Hotel downtown and anyone who stayed there who has been downtown LA, not the Arts District, downtown downtown would know that there's like an Ace shop around there, an Acne. There's all these great stories around the Ace and I don't know which ones you were responsible for and which ones you weren't, but I remember that Acne store opening in that incredible, it was like an Art Deco building. Eastern Columbia building. Yeah. Eastern Columbia building. You were really integral. Those were my deals. Yeah. I always sort of just say I just got really lucky to always have really good calling cards in the sense that working with Ace and then my first retail deal was Acne Studios downtown LA, right? Which is a pretty good place to start. So fortunate in that regard. Yeah. So it's an interesting place to be coming from and then Europe, anyone who follows Jonathan on Instagram knows he is a big Porsche guy and is also just like a car expert once he changed a flat tire for me when my husband was at Outtown. I did. Although honestly, even if Dan had been in town, I probably. One of my great pleasures. I was near your home and I was like, this guy will actually come do this and be able to do it and it's not going to be like a five hour thing. So thank you for doing that for me. My sincere pleasure. Anytime. I still owe you like steaks or something. No, it's all good. Okay. So, oh man, maybe you should come back to talk about fashion, retail, real estate, because I do have like a gazillion questions about that and how that stuff works. And you're obviously your rivalry with Jay Lux, which is probably just in my head. It's not a rivalry. Every time I see a Jay Lux photo, I think of you or whenever I see a chalet in your business partner post on a building, I think of Jay Lux. So might not be a rivalry, but I love it. Not a rivalry, but naturally a competitive business. Yes. Anyway, so last week was an interesting week in the fashion business because of all this tear FBS. And I do want to get to that because I know you have lots of opinions on it. But first, I want to talk about the big deal news, which was that Prada acquired Versace from Capri, the Prada group, which includes Mu Mu Prada, churches, and a couple other brands, Marquesi, the the candy, Patisserie. Yeah, Patisserie, essentially candy store. And a few other little things. They acquired Versace from Capri, the American group that owns Michael Cords and Jimmy Choo, for essentially $1.4 billion, not half of what Versace paid. Well, less than half of what Versace paid for it adjusted for inflation, but whatever. It was not, I mean, less than half of what Capri paid for it in 2018 adjusted for inflation. But honestly, not a terrible deal given the state of Versace right now, the state of Capri, which tried to merge with Tapisserie and the SEC said, no, we're not allowing, oh, the FTC said, no, we're not allowing it. So it's just been kind of Versace is kind of a mess. It was growing. And then it stopped growing and has actually seen a lot of declines even in an era when there was a big bump in a post COVID bump in fashion Versace was struggling. So now it's owned by Prada Group, Italian company in a transition between generations. There's a CEO who's not part of the family, but the next CEO will likely be the son of Mucci Prada and Patrizio Bertelli. What do you think about this deal for Versace and for Prada? Yeah, I mean, look, my experience is always going to be informed by the real estate. And when I interact with brands, either just socially as peers or professionally as clients, I think the conversation about them, what I always find fascinating is that you kind of have, I think like real estate guys typically are the ones who kind of historically you'd expect to know the least, right? But they've tended to become, and when I say real estate guys, I mean like landlords and things like that, they've become pretty sophisticated in knowing the brands that are cool of the moment, zeitgeist, et cetera, whatever you want to say. And I think that Versace in my world just hasn't really been in part of the growth conversation for a really long time on that basis. In fact, the opposite, like getting rid of some stores for performance reasons. So from that perspective, it's just sort of a little bit of a nothing burger. I think Mu Mu obviously, when they had their last downtrend, Prada absolved themselves of a lot of that real estate very quickly for Mu Mu. So I think now on the tailwinds of Mu Mu being like super hot, they're probably under distributed, right? From a retail perspective. So I think there's probably good opportunities. Versace actually has quite good real estate despite their lack of performance in a lot of places and a lot of primary markets that are otherwise competitive. So from that perspective, my lens is just, it feels like a good opportunity for Prada to plug in some Mu Mu stores in some prime Versace real estate. From a brand perception perspective, look, I think Prada Mu Mu Versace, from my view, are three very different brands, three very different prongs of consumers. It probably gives Prada as a group a lot of coverage on different types of consumers. It's that simple for me. Yeah, that's very similar. And I didn't even ask you for your opinion on this. And that's pretty much exactly what I wrote in line sheet last week was, I know Versace has really good real estate. Mu Mu needs to ramp up distribution to ride this. They've been growing, there was quarters where they grew over 100%. I think people don't realize how small Mu Mu was prior to this explosive growth. And it's still a very small company. So I would say that they're going to ride this as long as they can. So the real estate totally makes sense. It was worth it for that. And as we both know, it always goes back to real estate. But I think on the consumer point, one thing that keeps coming up, which I think is like... I made the joke, sorry, Nat's got you off. I made the joke that now they have a brand for Miami LA in New York. Well, it's 100% true. You would say Mu Mu is LA. Yeah. I went to lunch with someone on Friday at San Vicente Bungalows and she was wearing Mu Mu shoes and had a Mu Mu sweater. And everything else was not designer or it was designer, but not super obvious. But I mean, she looked really cool actually. She was definitely the best dress person at San Vicente Bungalows on Friday. But yeah, I think that the other thing is there are always cycles of what is in and what is out. And Prada has a base customer that never really leaves. Like I would say it's probably a woman in her 30s or 40s. And there is just a person who's always going to want to buy one piece from Prada every season. But there is also... That's limited in terms of who that reaches. Like Prada is probably the most universal of those three brands, but it's still not... I agree. It's not for everyone. No, but I also think it's the most evergreen from my perspective, right? Because they're never... At least publicly, in the media wars of luxury, they never seem to be trying to compete with the other big three, let's call them, right? They just... I think they're pretty good at staying their own lane, right? It's like it's like Stoosey versus Supreme. I would say Stoosey is the Prada of streetwear and Supreme is the LV trying to like bigger, bigger, bigger, all in your face, etc. Right? Yeah, no, that's 100% true. And it's a good base for a group. And it's really interesting. A lot of the people that I've talked to or a lot of messages I've gotten have been about the fact that Prada tried to build a group in the late 90s when Gucci Group was forming, when LVMH was acquiring a lot of brands and hiring young designers to refresh them and sometimes relaunch them. And Prada, the Berteles, bought Jill Sander and Helmut Lange and it was an epic failure. They owned them for, I think, less than five years or just about five years. They sold them for nothing. It didn't work. And there are several reasons this is very different. One is that Prada, Helmut Lange and Jill Sander were all of the same thing. Like if you were a customer of one of them in the 90s, you were probably a customer of the other one or maybe you're a Helmut person and you occasionally wore Prada accessories or you were totally Prada, but you had Jill Sander coats or something like that. And so there wasn't a lot of differentiation. And also they didn't have the experience. Berteli and Mugia, they were co-CEOs for a time, but Berteli really running the business in the late 90s. This was no one had done that before. And so when you look at what they're building now, first of all, Berteli is essentially retired. They have this interim CEO who he's not interim, but he's sort of in between Lorenzo, Berteli and Mugia Prada's child will eventually become the CEO of the company. But this guy, Andrea, who's the CEO, he's an operator and he's managed Laxotica. Like he has a lot of experience. So I think the idea that they are going to get the Miami crowd, and also we are moving out of a phase of like we went from logo mania to this subtle sort of norm core, high fashion, if you want to call it quiet luxury. And now I went to the last Versace show and it was sort of, it was really funny. The woman that I was sitting next to a fashion critic said, this is the worst show I've ever seen. And she was being hyperbolic, but then Caffe Horan gave it a great review. So it was interesting because I personally really enjoyed it and thought there were like all these fun ideas in it. It was a little bit wacky, but I think there is a customer who will always be there for the glitz and glam. But then also it just feels like everybody has a black cashmere sweater at this point. We need some different stuff. Yeah, I mean, I agree with that. And I think it's okay to have some differentiation. I could always make the joke. It's like about the, like what the timeline and lifecycle of a brand is where like, I'll use Abercrommie as an example. Like Abercrommie came here and it was so successful. And then as it fell off, it was like you'd see random German and Dutch guy tourists wearing like you know, long cargo shorts mid-calf. And it would be like very weird and 10 years later you'd be like, why is this Dutch tourist look like an American from like 10 years ago, right? And then after that it gets to Eastern Europe. And then after that it gets to whatever, right? So I think as you see all these like, as you have all of these different geographies that evolve in terms of where they sit in, you know, the cultural cycle, these life cycles extend beyond our purview in like a very significant way that I think we obviously are just more focused on, you know, the US and Europe and things like that. Yeah. Well, I mean, the extent to guys in really, really tight, skinny pants is a great example of that. For sure. Yeah. Because it's, that cycle is actually starting again in Prada, the last men's workshop they did. They did these like very, very ankle, skinny, tight, like borderline offensive jeans or pants that, but also felt subversive because men's pants in fashion have gotten bigger. So it's like, there are still people wearing tight, low-rise skinny jeans from what, and Raf Simons first introduced that idea 25 years ago. The trickle down is still exists with like regular guys across the world. Oh, sure. And now it's like the trend, the runway is matching what the last cycle of the trend is still what's still happening on the street, which is a fascinating, it's like a full circle moment, essentially. I mean, I was a hardcore 060 or 17 millimeter boy. So I get it, but you won't catch me on that moving forward, I'm sure. I bet you would. Location the lab. Quinten only has 24 hours to sell his car. Is that even possible? He goes to carvana.com. What is this? A movie trailer? He ignores the doubters, enters his license plate. Wow, that's a great offer. The car is sold, but will Carvana pick it up in time? They'll literally pick it up tomorrow morning. Done with the dramatics? Car selling in record time. Save your time. Go to carvana.com and sell your car today. Pick up these may apply. Okay, moving on. Let's get over, let's get this tariff stuff over with. Okay. So we know what happened. I don't know if you and I discussed this directly, but I assume you also assumed that the tariffs would not be implemented across like a blanket implementation as promised on April 2nd. And in the end, there is a delay and most of these tariffs probably won't be put in place. There will be deals made and et cetera, et cetera. Well, he already said, I mean, he already said yesterday about electronics and phones and computers, which is 30%, roughly 30% of the total Chinese export to the US, right? So it's obviously, there's a heavy degree of showmanship. So even in China, which he was going to keep the tariffs there, and we're talking about Trump, the president of the United States. And my husband kept saying, because he follows Apple very closely, he was like, they got an exemption last, last time they will this time. And I kind of was like, maybe they won't because this is the one hill he's going to die on. But the reality is the minute the bond market started to get screwed up, he couldn't keep going on this tariff rampage. So generally, what's your opinion about all this? And where do you think it'll shake out in like six months? So I had some big deals in out for signature in the last two weeks that sort of paused and sort of paused and sort of paused. And then come last Thursday, and you have the announcement at the end of the week or Friday or whatever it was. And I was pretty convinced at that point that those deals just wouldn't go forward or at the very least be paused. And come Monday morning, signatures are in my inbox and everything's moving forward. Now, I'd be lying to say there's obviously not concern, there's huge concern. But I also think that most of the sear, look, it depends on the brand, right? But let's say you're a very serious luxury brand who you're talking 10 year timelines on things, real estate deals or long term deals, you can't, no one's making long term plans on short term information, you just can't do it. So I haven't personally had anyone transactionally back out of a deal. I think there's, it's mostly like keep calm and carry on or let's just pause and see, but nothing fully stopping, right? And I think that like everything, not to get political, but like Trump has demonstrated on various subjects, right, that he likes to start fires so that he could be the hero to put them out, right? Like the US and like the conversations about investing in the US and on-shoring, it's like, you know, you had all these people like Apple and whomever else announcing we're investing X billions of dollars, but these were plans that were already in place, right? They've just now been PR'd to publicly reflect the demands of the administration, right? So I think, you know, I'm someone who believes the private sector is always smarter than the public sector, right? So I think I just, I just don't see it as a real long term issue, right? The other thing that I think everybody's ignoring or not really talking about, but to your point about like once the bond market crashed, it was over, he effectively told the international community, all you have to do is dump US treasuries and now you get a deal, right? And that's not a great place to be because obviously the most important thing for the United States to maintain its position is to be a reserve currency, right? So this, we need people to, even if it's at a discount, meaning a trade deficit, transact as much as possible at the highest dollar volume possible in US dollars, right? So that's just like the part of the conversation that hasn't really been had. So I think eventually he has smart people around him like, you know, like Lutvick, like Bessa, and like, you know, actual financial guys who I'm hoping they let him play his game for PR and then, you know, it very quickly gets rolled back and that's just his method, right? You know, I mean, it's funny, there was all this talk about the Bill Maher dinner with Trump, right? And, you know, Bill Maher spoke about it on his show this past weekend and he was like, I hate to tell you guys, there's not a crazy person living in the White House. There's someone living in the White House who plays a crazy person on TV, but my experience was that he's not crazy. So I think he knows what he's doing and I think, I shouldn't say I think he knows what she's doing. He's doing something intentionally is the better way of phrasing it. And, you know, I'm sure to some degree, he just takes, you know, they just take pleasure from whatever it's stuff. But look, here's what I would say. I agree, probably not crazy, maybe not that smart. And I agree with that. The issue is very impulsive. So like, this is the thing that when I'm... That's his M.O. Yeah, exactly. And when talking to luxury executives, what I think they... And I think a lot of people, a lot of executives misjudged going back into this. It's sort of like when you've had a traumatic experience and you don't remember it or giving childbirth, no one remembers how terrible it is, that type of thing. Like when coming into this, all these billionaires were like, we got to play the game with him because it's going to make him like us. I don't think you can do anything to make that guy bend to your will. I think it's all about he's playing a game and he'll go as far as he can. The question is, yeah, the question is, like, to what end and what kind of destruction. And I... The tariffs thing, like people kept asking us, can you do a tariffs guide? I was like, no, this is not going to actually happen. Quit. And we did write about it a little bit in Sarah Shapiro on my team who writes retail stuff for lunch. She's following it because there are interesting points to be made. But the idea that you could prepare is just insane. Like, there is no way to prep for the stuff. I think for me, the conclusion I came to, which was pre-terrific is going to be this way anyway, is the next two quarters are going to be kind of shitty because the economy wasn't going to be good no matter what. It's a tough... Their inflation is high. Like mortgage rates are still really high. And at the end of 2025, we're going to see things start to move around or change and consumer behavior pick back up. I still believe that. And the one thing that... Maybe this is a conspiracy theory, but I did hear this from several people was this idea that Trump was essentially trying to tank the economy so that the Fed would be forced to lower interest rates. Yeah. So that may feel like a little bit too much, but maybe that's what's going to happen. I think there's lots of conspiracies floating around, which I will always in the interest of entertainment entertain for myself. However, I mean, there's also... I've also heard he wants to tank it. So there's a run on gold because Russia needs to rearm. There's like a million of these things. The one thing I'll say that's my bigger concern out of it is just that like COVID, like inflation in the name of COVID and whatever, all these companies have raised their prices so significantly over the last few years anyway. And at the end of the day, luxury, real luxury, capital L luxury, if you're going to be on the waiting list for a watch for two years, you don't care if it was $50,000 when you put your name on the list or $60,000 when you receive it, you're still buying it because there's that waiting period. I also think my concern is that out of this, people are going to very aggressively and quickly raise prices. And then that's again going to be the next threshold long after tariffs have been reduced. And that's where I think it's problematic. That's kind of it. It's a concern. I would say that there is a lot of price resistance already in luxury that they have to be careful because consumers even these, you're absolutely right that if you're spending 50 grand on a watch, you don't care if it's 60 grand. And Hermes is obviously the best example of this because they're, and I talked about this on Peter Hamby's podcast, The Powers That Be Last Week. Hermes bags could be way more expensive than they are and they price them in a way that make fewer of them and still make a great profit so that you don't flood the market. And I think what happened was a lot of luxury brands. I was looking for a dress the other day because we have like a bunch of events. So many dresses right now are for a grand and it's just like, I don't, even if I had that kind of money, it's just dumb. It's getting to this point. So I think there needs to be like a mental adjustment of, okay, this is what stuff costs. On the other hand, maybe this is an opportunity for people and especially people who don't buy $4,000 dresses, people who buy $400 dresses, maybe this is an opportunity if the prices are raised across the board and at the lower end as well to stop buying so much stuff and go back to this idea of you buy one or two things every quarter to refresh your wardrobe. And that's it. Like there is an argument that none, our clothes, and I've made this point millions of times, like a pair of jeans costs way less money when you adjust for inflation or even the number if you didn't adjust, then they did in like 1950. Like you can buy a pair of jeans for $20 now and you could buy a pair then for $20. That's not normal. No, I mean, I agree with you. The one thing I posted on Instagram when talking about this was like, I think the only positive to come out of this is in the vein of exactly what you're saying is hopefully this leads people, right? Because I think the media obviously never fails to like hyper react to every story, right? So I think you had a lot of people who maybe don't have economic backgrounds or business backgrounds in any kind of way to be like, oh, he put 125% tariffs on China, all my stuff from China is going to go up 125%. That's obviously not how that works. We know that's not how that works. However, what I said, I hope this actually does is maybe, and I'm probably kidding myself, but maybe consumers or a larger swath of consumers will become more aware of what they're actually buying and what the actual cost of the things they're buying is to realize how ridiculous this is to achieve the end you're talking about, right? Yeah. So it's very highly unlikely we have an economy based on consumption, but it is an interesting thing.

Talking about consumption, for the last 10 years or so in beauty, the model has sort of been based on this brand Glossier, where the way when Glossier launched, Emily Weiss, who's the founder, launched in 2014-2015, is this drops model where you drop one product, the consumer buys it, they posted on Instagram a week later, a new product drops, they buy it, they posted on Instagram, this cycle. Glossier became this brand that all the fashion brands I talked to were obsessed with. Like, they were looking at Glossier's marketing, the way they reached the customer through content, through comments on posts, things like that, community feedback. And it became sort of the model of how to build a modern brand. And in, I think, 2021, they raised a series E at a $1.8 billion valuation. And last week in line, she, Rachel Schergetz, wrote a piece about how they are raising another $100 million. They said in her reporting, she talked to people close to the company who said they don't actually need to raise the money, blah, blah, blah. But the money is being raised at a valuation of half, or less than half of what it was, less than a billion dollars of what it was four years ago. So as someone who is looking at different brands constantly, you know what goes in and out of retail stores, storefronts. What do you think about like the Glossier trajectory and what do you think is going to happen to it? Do you think that they're going to be able to like sustain and become, you know, their generation's estate lotter, or do you think 10 years from now Glossier won't exist? There's so much to unpack with Glossier. And I think you, I don't know if you know this, but I did the first Glossier LA store and the second one in collaboration with a colleague of mine, and then the Chicago, the first Chicago store as well. So I mean, I have some experience with it. You know, we have a mutual friend who was running it at the time. So I worked with her on that. Look, I think you use the right word in saying trajectory, right, which I just think it's one of these things where, you know, they were so my sense of it, right, which is not a reflection of necessarily the work I did with them. But my sense of it is just that, you know, they were so intentional about the nature in which they wanted to grow early on, and who that customer was, which was a positive thing, right. And then I think they sort of had two things, you know, my market read on it is two things really affected them negatively, right. The first is that, you know, as DTC became, you know, it's funny, there was this moment, obviously, you remember, like all the retail apocalypse conversations of a few years ago. And there was this moment where DTC stopped being referenced as a distribution model and rather started being referenced as a segment of brands in the conversation, right. In my work with Glossier, I think they recognized that really early on and didn't want to fall into that conversation as being adjacent to the Warby Parkers, the Everlanes of the world, the, you know, Allbirds of the world, etc. They realized that was a liability and tried to avoid that. That being said, the commercial enterprises that support that type of business, meaning like real estate people, etc. ultimately always recognize them as a DTC brand, right. I think that was sort of the challenge. That was challenge one. Challenge two from my world is, you know, just my view on it is like COVID, right. They had just spent a lot of money on big stores like LA and things like that. And COVID happened. And the customer who was like a very specific customer, right, like call it 16 to 25 or something like that, right. Then they grew up and all of those and COVID was over and they probably went to, you know, whatever the next rung of beauty you go to is after that. And then I think they sort of fell into a boat where it was like, they didn't really have that hyper-defined customer anymore. And there was so much perception around it that it just sort of fell off a bit, right. And then I think that's kind of when Emily stepped down and there was some cleaning house and things like that. But it's sort of, at least in my world, fallen out of the conversation a bit and obviously has gotten, you know, press that I wouldn't say is necessarily helpful to them, right. You know, one of the things I always find really funny in my world, which isn't unique to Glossier, I mean, I can name countless brands where this is the case. It's like, I might be really excited about them. Real estate people might be really excited about them. Investors might be really excited about them. Customers might be really excited about them. But the press hates them, right. Or at least, at the very least, is extremely critical of them. So I always find that interesting when it's like, why is the fashion press or the luxury press critical of this brand when both the customer who ultimately matters and all the commercial enterprises behind it fundamentally think very highly of the brand, right. It's a bit like, often what do you guys know that we don't know, which I'm sure is a lot sometimes. But you know, that I think there's a bit of that same sort of phenomenon in Glossier. Yeah. It's interesting. I see it as being part of the press. Like, I think what the press does wrong is they really pump brands up. And then the minute there's a change, or there's a bump, they are really down on them. And I don't know if Glossier has experienced that as much as some other brands because they're, I would say Rachel is really the only Rachel Stregatz is really the only one who knows anything about their business who's covering it. So, but she knows a lot. And the thing I would say is last year, they had a lot of wins that she reported on with the launch of a fragrance. And, but I kept saying to her, there's something not right about what's happening here. There's just something not right about it. And you could just tell that like the other for me, when I look at what happened with them, it comes down to she had offers to, I don't know how like, I don't know if there was a term sheet, but there were people who wanted to buy it. And she should have sold it in 2018, when it was valued at like a billion dollars. And they should have sold it like there's the end you can't go back. And this happens all the time. In the media environment we're in, sadly, branding is a momentum game when it's something like that. Right? Like, it's, you know, there's lots of brands, even I work with or I've been friends with for a long time, you know, that they finally get investment, you know, 10 years later from a group. And I'm a bit like, oh, you know, let's, let's go work together. But also like, I feel like you kind of missed the boat. And now you got to like, re PR this whole thing, and actually sort of like reintroduce some sort of a zeitgeist of some kind, right? Like, so, I mean, Glossier is definitely, at least from my perception, lost the zeitgeist element. Totally. Right. And I just don't, you know, it's sort of, you know, and also the, you know, the sad thing is, you know, in my world, right? And this happened with a few brands during COVID, you know, especially ones that overreacted to closing stores. Yeah. Once you, once you close stores in the, in my commercial world, you know, and I mean, I don't mean like you close one under performing door. I mean, like you significantly reduce your portfolio of stores. Once you do that, like you become no longer viable in the conversation, right? Like the places that will give you scale, where you're going to go to a mall landlord and do 10 deals at once, they don't want to talk to you anymore, right? Probably because you closed one of their doors already. And there's a, you know, a concern there. But also because you've now communicated to the market that you're not doing well, which is a tough place for a brand to be in, right? Because it's a lot, I don't think that effect is really considered in the short term, you know, cleaning house and, you know, financial solution oriented, you know, acts, but it's, you know, it puts them in a tough position. So yeah, yeah, I think, I think they just lost the plot and we'll see. I still think the base of the brand is, was brilliant. And, and there is an opportunity there. But unfortunately, it just, there was a, there was a, there were many things that sort of went wrong from the product itself, not really living up to replenishment hype. Like you need to be a brand that the product is good enough that people buy it again and again. I think they struggled with that at one point. I think the marketing got off track at one point. And then also the, they invested in tech, they, it just was like everything that you're talking about. And I do think I was talking to Peter Hamby about this last week. He had texted me from North Park over Christmas and his wife said to him, tell Lauren that like, there's no line at the Glossier store. And that's something like from your perspective, look, a lot of these lines are manufactured, but that Glossier line was not manufactured. And so there's no more line. That means something. The last point I'll make on that is I just think, you know, to wrap it up is I'm also, you know, and there was a moment for this. And I've, you know, I think there's, I'm going to be careful how I say this, not because it's about a particular person, but because I realize it's very specific on segment and type of brand. But in a lot of cases, I'm very skeptical of, you know, brands where the founder is very front facing, right? And, you know, anecdotally, the story I'll give, you know, because I think that's hard to give up, right? That's very difficult to give up. And by the time you're smart enough to give it up, it's probably a little bit, I won't say too late, but, you know, you've gone past it. You know, a good example, and I won't say which brands, but you know who I work with. You know, there was one beauty brand I was working with, you know, while it was independent that, I shouldn't say beauty, I'll say fragrance, fragrance brand that, you know, was like very much that the brand of the, you know, that mid 2000s New York fashion set. And then there was another one I was working with, it was sort of a competitor, but a little more low key, etc. And the competitor brand says to me, he says, you know, when that person dies, that brand won't exist anymore, and my brand will live forever, right? And it was sort of a funny comment because I was like, all right, guy, like you're just jealous, you know, other founder relaxed. But now that some of these brands have traded hands, you know, 10 years later, he's right, right? He's right that in the, you know, in the investor world of that founder led brand, it's not, it just doesn't have the impact. So yeah, and this is something we're going to look at skims for the next two years of what, and I personally believe that skims can exist without Kim Kardashian. I think they've done a very good job at not actually making it like, yes, everybody knows it's her. But I actually think skims has done a really good job at not leaning too heavily on, on her impact. I agree. In spite of her, it succeeded in some ways, because if you look, they really haven't had any other big business success. I agree with you. It's good American, okay, but not, not the best. So like, I think they've, that's an interesting case study of it. But yes, you're right. Like, I think this is a, this comes back to founder syndrome, like, can you get out of your own way or not? And you can't blame Emily Weiss for all of this. Like, she, you also have to give her a lot of credit. But the reality is, like, something, someone lost the plot somewhere. And it's just, it, here's hoping they can sort of reposition it and, and get back on track, because it is just such a great brand. And, and it's not like, the hard thing about building a business in this era is that you are tracked every single day on TikTok by consumers. So it's not, it's the journalist, yes, but it's also the consumer is like, I, this happened at the Glacier store, this product, I'm going to review this and you have to be brand first, you have to be brand first. I mean, I, I've, I, I, I, you know, I was having breakfast with the founder of this, you know, young brand recently, not beauty, but, you know, it was with her and her mother, who's her business manager, who has a, you know, really strong background in that world. And, you know, that we're saying like, look, your, your customer probably, you know, your PR agency wants you to do a lot of like customer facing kind of things. And I, you know, I said to her, I was like, you know, you're 27 years old, don't do this, you know, just, just don't exist, like, don't, don't exist, be a ghost, like we're past that being the effective thing, and it will be so much more powerful for your brand long term to just cease, cease to publicly exist. You know, it's a balance, but my advice is like, you know, I think you're shifting that if you are going to do this, you know, it's less about, you know, founder influencer and more about like actual legitimate thought leadership, like go do a, go do a talk at HBS, don't like, you know, be in some tech form kind of thing. So great advice, Jonathan. Thanks for joining me. This was so fun. My pleasure. Thanks for having me. Fashion people is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck.

My name is Nicole Carroll and I'm a member of the Pulitzer board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out it was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself?
