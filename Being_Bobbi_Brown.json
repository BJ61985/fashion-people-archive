Oh my God, I don't know how I'm going to do it. I'll be okay. I'm not complaining. It's just a lot. Like I've been away from my family and my home for many days. It's okay. I mean, it's a great job. I have a really good time, but it's just a lot. So I had coffee with a friend who worked in the industry and has been working in the industry for more than 30 years earlier this week. As an executive, I guess you could call this person a source, but also, you know, I've known them for a long time. And I caught up with them before a show this week. And one of the things they said was that this is like the craziest time they've ever witnessed. Like in their three decades in the business, this is the craziest time. And you know, who knows? Like you always think the time you're living in is the craziest time. So I don't know if it's actually that heightened now than it was 30 years ago. It sure feels like it's heightened, more heightened than it was even five years ago. But I think one thing to note is that the luxury business in particular, and we are at Paris Fashion Week, so let's talk luxury. It's bigger than ever. But in some ways, it's like much more culturally vulnerable than it was in the last few years because consumer habits are actually changing right now. Like they were sort of changing pre-pandemic and then there was a reverse during the pandemic. Now what was like happening pre-pandemic where people were like, oh, I'm just going to spend my money on travel and all that stuff. And the clothes are complimentary. That is starting to really sort of pick up. And that change in the way consumers think about fashion. The fashion is not the center of it. It's like complimentary to all the other stuff you're spending money on. I think that's why we're seeing so many big changes at the big houses and all the speculation about companies being spot and sold and designers going from here to there and all the musical chairs, et cetera. And if you're interested in learning more details of what is actually going on right now, check out Line Sheet because I'm tracking everything from the Chanel Creative Director gig to changes of LVMH and plenty more. Seems like I got a delivery. PS, sorry to everyone who wants my dermatologist name in France. I cannot give it to anyone else. So it's okay. You'll find one. Just ask another friend. And maybe I'll dole out a couple more recommendations at some point. But apologies. I would love to give it to you, but I don't want to overwhelm this person. I'll be back on Monday with a retail report from The Row. I endeavor to go and check it out. And let me know if there are any other stores you want me to see while I'm in Paris. And enjoy this interview with Bobby. I grew up watching her on The Today Show. And so, of course, it feels like I already know her. We also went to the same college, not at the same time, but it means something. Emerson is not a big school. And I would just say the way she does makeup, it really, I think, it defined how we all do our makeup. It was the way I learned how to do makeup, watching her on The Today Show or reading tutorials and magazines and things like that. And I think she has helped to define my personal beauty ideals. So it was interesting to speak to her about her business, about what she likes, what she doesn't like, proportional taste and all that good stuff. And I hope you enjoy it. Bobby Brown, welcome to Fashion People. Oh, thank you. So nice being on your show. I'm such a big fan. I'm such a big fan of yours. So I don't know if I've said this in our exchange, but I am a graduate of Emerson College. Oh, yes, but not quite the same time I went, but yes, it was an amazing place. And you studied makeup. Yeah, I have a degree. I have a BFA from Emerson with a degree in theatrical makeup and a minor in photography. It's amazing. I also have a BFA. Uh-huh, which I'm not sure what. It just sounded cool, right? I didn't know what a gay I got. Nothing. Nothing. Yes, yes. What was it like there? What era were you there? And were you there when it was like a big speech pathology school? I don't know if it was. I didn't pay attention because I found Emerson. It was my third college and my first two colleges, I just didn't want to go back to either of them. And my mother, you know, was the one that sat me down and said, what do you want to do? And I said, I don't know. She said, well, if it's your birthday, what would you want to do? I said, I want to play with makeup. She said, be a makeup artist. So I said, I don't want to go to beauty school. And she said, I'm sure there's a college somewhere. I found Emerson. I actually flew up the day before school started and they let me in. And they have what's called an interdisciplinary major, which means I don't know why, but it just basically meant that I could make up my own major. I said, can I study makeup? They said, OK. I said, do you have any courses? They said, no. I said, OK, I'll tell you what I should do. And I did it and I graduated. It's such an interesting school. It is a place that if you, I don't know what it's like. Now it was 20 year reunion for me this year, but it was a place where if you didn't know what you wanted to do when you got there, you probably would end up leaving. It was very transient because it was so focused on, it was very trade school-y in that way, even though it's a four year university and all of that stuff. Yeah, I never, I didn't think it was trade school. I mean, I graduated with Dennis Leary who went into being. OK, yes. Yeah. And one of the guys that started Will and Grace, and one of the guys from Friends, and we were all on the board together way after we graduated. And it was just, I founded Just to Be a Place that allowed students like me who are creative to give like this open book and say, make your own story. Like you could be whoever and whatever. And it allowed me to really soar. And honestly, like I didn't think I was that smart growing up because I was so bored in school, but I realized at Emerson, wow, I'm capable. And so that's smart. Maybe Emerson will feature this podcast on their channels or something. All I have to do is text the president and he'd be happy to feature it. Yes, done. Oh my God. Very funny. So how did you, when you left school, were you like, I want to do makeup for the theater or for film or for, what did you do after you left? Well, I thought I wanted to make, to do makeup for movies because why wouldn't I want to do makeup for movies? It sounded so glamorous. I did one movie after I graduated a local feature and it was so boring. I was like, I can't do this. And I was also studying all the fashion magazines, like looking at the credits, who's doing what, who did makeup on it. I just was devouring the fashion pages and the beauty pages. And I reached out to some people that I saw on the side of the pages and I started asking questions about, can I assist you for free? What can I do? So that's how I kind of headed into the fashion world in New York. So when I left, I waitress for a year because I needed to pay my rent. But then I moved to New York and I just started pounding the pavement trying to figure out, how do I work? How do I make a living? What did you find out? Did you assist makeup artists? Did you get in with someone in particular? I got in with a lot of people. So when I moved to New York, I opened up the yellow pages because there was no other option. And I started looking up models, modeling agencies. And then I just started calling them. I called the makeup artist union. I said, hi, I'm here. And he said, great. I said, how do you get in the union? I thought he would just give me like a library card. And he said, well, do you know anyone? I said, no. He said, well, it'll take you about seven or nine years if you don't know anyone. And he said, but I can help you along the way. And he got me to assist a makeup artist on Saturday Night Live. So I did that for a moment. And then I also found Brian Bantry, an agent, because I called a makeup artist named Bonnie Mallor and her answering machine said, if I'm not home, call my agent. So I called her the agent and he started passing me different things. You know, I can't represent you because you don't have a book. Well, I don't have a book, but how do I get a book? Well, you need tear sheets. How do I get tear sheets? So I was so naive and he started helping me. What was your sort of first big break? You know, there were so many big breaks, but my first little break was working with Glamour magazine, doing a story on a dancer that was like 15 pictures in a page. The photographer Bridget Lancombe hired me to do hair and makeup, but I also had to do this dancer's feet, which was really disgusting. But you know, as a makeup artist, you do it. And then I started assisting Bonnie a little bit, assisting Linda Mason, and just studying, like studying everything that was in every fashion magazine. I knew every, I knew every booking editor at all the magazines. I knew who was doing what. And I slowly started to work, which was great because I couldn't get a waitressing job. So I figured I'd better make it in makeup. So it took me seven years, but I got a vocal cover with Patrick de Marchelier and Naomi Campbell's first cover. And then I was, I wasn't in the beauty industry. I was in the fashion industry. And that's how I learned. So what was the sort of when you started out and you were assisting these people that first seven years, what was the aesthetic visual on the face at that time? Like what was the focus? Was it the eyes? Was it blush? What did you study and how did you sort of make it your own? Well, the good news is I wasn't very good at it because the style was contour, really white faces. And I did a cover of British Cosmo with Jerry Hall, which I was a nervous wreck. And I went there and I did her makeup. I did the whole top to bottom thing. I showed her a mirror. I said, I'm done. What do you think? And she said, it's lovely. Do you mind if I touch it up? I said, I don't mind at all. She pretty much redid her whole face because I didn't know how to do that. And I didn't think she looked particularly great that way. And so I started slowly just making models look healthy. I don't know why. I just started kind of putting bronzers on their cheeks and, oh, I could take the bronzer and put it on the eyes. Oh, that looks cool. Let me put it on the lips. So I started slowly to do more things that I thought the girls looked better. It took a while, but eventually I became known for that look when the entire industry was, mega colors on the face and a lot of contouring. And that was the 80s, the end of the 80s. With the really powdery white, because I'd look at old photos of my mom from the mid-80s, and her foundation was so light. And now it just looks crazy. And I'm sure back then it wasn't. But do you know what was driving that aesthetic? Was it the whole Victorian kind of punk seeping down from that? Or what do you think it was? Well, Victorian and punk are so different. They couldn't be more different. But no, I think- True, but there's- I think because if you went into a department store, and at the time I remember going into Bergdorf Goodman with my dad's credit card because I couldn't afford it, I said, well, if I could buy expensive makeup, the foundation should probably match the skin. And so I spent a lot of money on the fancy bottles from everyone from Chanel to Lotte, to Clinique and whoever else. And they just made people look pasty and white. And so as a makeup artist, I was like, all right, well, this isn't good. Even back then I knew there was something wrong. So I went to a theatrical makeup store and bought yellow and orange and red and all these things that I would mix into these foundations so it matched the skin. And by the way, they needed yellow. They were like- They look like milk of magnesia or Peptobismo and they were pretty. Forget about how it looked on any models that were black or from a darker skin tone didn't work at all. So I became the person that fixed all the makeup because I didn't like the way it looked on them. Who were some of your favorite fashion industry collaborators at that time? Who did you have a really good time with on set? Well, Bruce Weber. I mean, working with Bruce Weber for me was such a game changer because he didn't like makeup. And so the first time I worked with him, I did my pretty makeup and he said, it's beautiful, but could you wash it off? And I was like, okay. And he said, look, and he pinched her cheeks and he said, that's the color I want. And then he had her bite her lips. And so I started to learn how to put makeup on a model's face where Bruce Weber would love it. And so I did that for a while. I worked with Stephen Klein who did not like that kind of makeup and would push me to do stronger, crazy things. And that was helpful when I started doing a lot of fashion shows. But you know, Bruce was a big collaborator and I don't know if you know Walter Chin. I do know somehow, but a really talented photographer worked in the 90s. I worked with him a lot. I worked with Arthur Elgort a lot. I started to work with people that liked my style instead of me trying to be like everyone else. And it just seemed to fit so much better when I worked with people that understood exactly who I was and not trying, not me trying to fit into what they wanted. I wasn't that kind of a makeup artist. So wild to me to think of you backstage at fashion shows because that's such like you seem too important or something because of the way fashion shows work has changed so much too. Like how long were you doing backstage at shows? Did you do them in Europe too? Or was it mostly at New York or? You know, the only Europe one I did was with Lorenz Scott in London, which was amazing. And you know, the pictures I have with her, I'm five foot tall and she was like six, five, six, seven. And working with her was just incredible. And then you'd get to have all these things like, oh, Mick is coming in for a makeup test. And Mick and I would be discussing what kind of blush the model should have. And you know, oh, and would you like to come over to dinner at our house? Sure, we'd love to come over. Those were magic days. But I did Fashion Week probably for 20 or more years. And it was a cool, wonderful thing to do creatively, but also it got your name out there. Yeah. And magazines would write about you and then TV would come in and you'd be on television. And then eventually these women from Wisconsin or Idaho would come in and, oh, these are bloggers. Like what's a blogger? So, you know, I was there for all the changing times. And it's actually fun, engaging, personalized and packed with encouraging feedback to help keep them motivated.

Are there any other designers who you feel like you have a really long time collaboration with that was special? I mean, there was a bunch. I mean, I worked with Michael Kors for probably six or seven years. And actually, I'll never forget the day that my phone rang and it was Michael who said, Bobby, I love you, but I just have to tell you, I'm making a change. I hired a new stylist and I'm going to hire a different makeup artist. And, you know, at first I was crushed, but then I was like, that is the most menchie thing. And people didn't do things like that. So I'll never, you know, forget that he did that. Yeah, I feel like creative collaborations come to an end. Like some relationships just come to a natural end and people avoid confrontation and so they ruin like a really great moment in your life. Someone said to me when I was very young that people come in and out of your life and you just have to sort of accept that. And that's a great example of, and that's probably why I don't know if you've listened to Paul Kovako's podcast with Michael Kors on his own. It was so good. No, I haven't. Oh, you have to listen to it. It's fantastic. Yeah. But you can just tell that he's like wants to do the right thing and in the end, you'll always have that. And those images are so burnt in my head. I mean, thinking about, you mentioned these bloggers from Idaho or what have you, but I grew up in Pittsburgh and my mom, I mean, you totally changed the way, speaking of my mom doing her Way Too White Foundation, I remember growing up watching you on morning television and her just like using every single tip that you would give. Were you on the Today Show or Good Morning America? I was. I was on the Today Show for 14 years and how did I even get on the Today Show? I was at a book signing and I met this really nice older lady asking me a makeup question and she said, Honey, you've done so much. Is there anything else you'd like to do? She said, I've seen you on the Today Show and it just popped into my head. I said, I'd love to be a regular on the Today Show. She grabbed my hand and she said, Honey, Jeff Zucker is my grandson. And I became, true story, I became the regular, you know, once a month beauty editor of the Today Show and I was on for 14 years. I remember and was this around the same time that you launched the brand? That you started the brand? It was after. It was after. So the brand, you know, I started doing lipsticks while I was a makeup artist. You know, all this time, by the way, I was probably one of the few working mothers. I got pregnant. I got married first. I got pregnant. I moved to New Jersey. You know, my kids grew up in Montclair. I commuted and, you know, we have three sons and so those days are kind of a blur, but, you know, I did it. I'm running, you know, from one fat cool fashion show to home to, you know, make my family dinner, which I could make a dinner in 15 minutes, if not 10. If there was chaos in my house, I just learned all these great hacks. And, you know, as an entrepreneur, you do what you got to do, your real life and your work. But it was kind of interesting to have both worlds, the high fashion world and my real suburban world. Do you think having those two things, when you started the brand, helped you kind of develop the collection and the way a point of view, you had a point of view, but sort of how you wanted to put it into action in some ways? Right. I mean, a hundred percent, because, you know, while other people were talking about the fabulosity of some trend, I was talking about the reality of getting out the door in two minutes and doing your makeup either in your car or on a train, you know, and how you can get yourself looking not so bad when you have to go, you know, to back to school or to soccer. And, you know, I was once told by someone that I should really create a different reality. And no one wants to hear about people that actually go to soccer games. No one wants to get make-up advice from a soccer mom. Well, guess what? Those are my customers, right? Like real people. So it did really help and guide the way that, you know, the first company, Bobby Brown Cosmetics, was. When you started out there doing product, there weren't like a ton of people, independent people, like you make-up artists making stuff, right? How did you figure out where the supply chain, now there are all these accelerators. If you want to launch a beauty brand, you can go to someone and say, I want to launch a beauty brand. And they're like, here's a lap, here are the formulas, here's all this stuff. That didn't exist, right? So how did you do it? Well, just in the Bobby way, I met a chemist and I said, what do you do? And he said, I'm, you know, I am a chemist. I make these lipsticks. And I said, wow, they're really nice. And I said, I've always wanted to make a lipstick. He said, I can make it for you. So that's how I started. I said, yeah, I want something that's not greasy, not dry. I wanted something that didn't smell like my mother's lipstick. And I wanted something the color of my lips. And he made it for me. And I was like, oh my God, I bet I could sell this. And that's how I started selling out of my house. And then over lunch with an editor, I told her what I was doing. And she said, well, can I write about it? She was an editor from Glamour. Why would you want to write about it? Now I know it's called PR. And we got a lot of orders. And I realized not everyone likes the same color lipstick I did. So I made 10. And then I met this other nice lady. And I said, what do you do? And she said, I'm a cosmetics buyer from Bergdorf. So I launched a Bergdorf. She could have been from Macy's, but she was from Bergdorf. So we launched at Bergdorf and we sold the company after four years to Estee Lauder. Wow. Yeah. It was only for you. And when did you sell it? Four and a half years. Let's see. I always know because I think about my kids, but I think it was 92 when we sold. And I stayed with Estee Lauder 22 years. So you sold to them before they had bought MAC? No, they already owned half a MAC. Half a MAC, yeah. Half of MAC, yeah. And we sold to them because Leonard Lauder is the most amazing human being on earth. We sold to them for many other reasons, but I stayed until I left and then had to finish off a non-compete, a 25-year non-compete. 22 years. Well, I thought it was later than that. That's remarkable. Yeah. So when you, at that time, the market was so different, especially for color cosmetics, you sort of created an entirely new category of what you're saying, which is like you said healthy, which I think is a good way, but a lot of people would have said the natural look. Right. I mean, what does natural look mean? I mean, natural look could mean you're in the field, so I'm for mom looking like a hippie. Yeah. To me, I'm such a visual addict. I look at people's skin. I see their color of their blush. I see the color of their natural eyelids. Their lip color. So it's, I kind of created the nude look before other people took nude and kind of turned it into this big beige blush. Yeah. Like nude are the colors that are right for your coloring and skin. Yeah. I don't want to get too much into makeup tips, since this is more of a inside the industry podcast, but what were the fundamentals that you taught people when you were, one thing that I think of is what you're talking about like color matching, but also where you wear your blush. Because in the 80s, it was like really high up on the cheekbones. And it felt like when I was growing up, and you learn more about the apples of your cheeks. And what were the things that women like really struggled with that you felt like you were helping them with the most when you started the line and you started doing all this TV and being public facing? Well, I just always did what I did, which was, you know, how I put my makeup on myself and everyone else. And it's how I do it today. And it's really the same concepts that I brought into Jones Road, the new brand, because it's blush should go on your cheek. It should go on the apple. You should blend it up, take your brush and kind of blend it down so it doesn't look like you have a stripe. And if you have a little too much on, you could put a little bit of something, you know, with your fingertips and like one of the miracle bombs to kind of pat it down. And I think I've always been known just for real tips. Like, I know how to make people look gorgeous, but I know how to make people look not tired. Yeah. And prettier. And that's, to me, that's about, that makes you feel better, look better. And it's about confidence. How important was it? Do you think that you were so public facing and that I'm sure people come up to you all the time? More now than ever before. Okay. So I can't even imagine. You can't because I used to be, you know, in vogue all the time. I used to, but when I went on QVC years ago, that was a whole different demographic. But now, you know, with our, all of our digital ads and now I'm, you know, we're, we do have other ads and all the social, I literally sometimes I just talk and someone says, I know that voice. And I'm like, oh my God, I can't stand my voice. But luckily people come to me and they just say, thank you so much. I just love the new brand and what you've done. You're, you're making things that actually I didn't know I needed. Yeah. So, make the switch to Bokeh for the whole family today at BOKA.com. So let's talk about your experience at S-Day, why you left and why you started something new. Because you, you didn't have to start anything else. You could have just written books or, or done whatever you wanted to do. I've written, I've, I've written nine books and I don't know how to type. So anyways, I'm working on my 10th, but you know, I left when I left S-Day, why did I leave? I mean, first of all, who else sells their company and stays 22 years? So you could imagine went through different things and at the end it was, I wasn't in charge anymore. I was not the boss. There were layers upon layers and things kept changing and the beauty industry changed. The fashion industry changed. Our world change was changing and it was just, I couldn't fight anymore. You know, I'm, I'm tough and I'm a fighter. When I want something, I, I insist and I get it. I worked with people to get it. I just couldn't do it anymore. And so I left not knowing what I was going to do without a plan. And the first thing I ended up doing, I didn't look for. It just kind of happened. My dear friend is a guy named Richard Baker, who I'm sure you've reported on. Oh, I know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, he's one of my, one of, you know, I have Mickey as a friend. I have Richard Baker as a friend. I have the best. I'm a fan. Yeah. I have the best friend group. And so Richard said, excellent, you're available. Come talk to me. And he offered me the Just Bobby shop at Lord and Taylor because he was trying to fix Lord and Taylor. Yeah. And I got to work with the team and really just do a concept shop and just kind of bring things in from my favorite brands. I got to walk around the store and go into showrooms and it was kind of like doing fashion and accessories. And that was really fun because again, I still had an on compete for beauty. So I did that for a while. And then he sold Lord and Taylor and I opened, you know, Just Bobby online. And just started doing other projects. I ran my husband and I developed a hotel called the George. We opened a TV and film studio called 18 label in Montclair. And then I started messing around with formula. Really quickly on Montclair, how has that culture changed in the last 30 years? Because I feel like suburban, there's something in right now like fetishizing suburban culture and the way it hasn't been for decades. What has the change, the transformation of Montclair looked like? Well, I'm from the suburbs of Chicago originally. So I'm comfortable with grass and driving to my supermarket and I'll, you know, which Chicago suburb will match. Newtrier West High School will match. Yeah. Yeah. I know new trim. My husband grew up in Rogers Park, but went to Northwestern and went to Lincoln Park. But Newtrier, all the, we know everybody's from there. If you know people from Chicago. Yeah. So it was a great, I'm so glad I'm from there and I'm so glad I left. So, you know, just Montclair is 12 miles from Manhattan. And I say it's the Brooklyn of New Jersey because it's cool. It's hip. It's eclectic. It's mixed. And so my husband and I actually moved to Montclair the day we got back from our honeymoon. We had no kids, no dog, but we both knew we didn't want to really have a New York City marriage and life and kids. So we found Montclair and my husband is an urban planner by trade, but a developer and we developed and renovated a house and we haven't kind of stopped since. He's done a lot of things in Montclair and he developed and built the George. He, you know, he's got a soccer dome. We've got 18 label, which is our film and TV studio, my offices. And now he does all of Jones Road stores. So, um, So it's pretty fun. It's so fun. So before we get to Jones Road, what fat, you've been around fashion for all these years. You've worked with these amazing photographers and stylists and collaborated with them. You had your own, you've had two really beautiful lines that are so, you know, the visuals are so clear and developed everything. What fashion are you into? What do you wear day to day? Which brands are you fascinated by? And how has that changed over the years? Well, I'm such a mix because, you know, like right now I'm wearing my favorite sweater that I have everywhere from Uniqlo. It's a men's. I'm obsessed with men's wear. By the way, I'm five foot tall. So not like regular clothes don't fit me very well. And I'm always on camera. I'm on TV or I'm, you know, standing in front of a crowd giving a speech. I have discovered J Crew Boys size 12 or 14 button down shirts. They look like exactly like the two Neely Lotens I just bought. I just bought two Neely Loten button downs. I swear to God, they look exactly like my $38 J Crew Boys. I love classic. So I love Paul Smith. I absolutely, you know, wish people would make more kind of normal clothes again. I don't look good in the big wide legs. And whenever, you know, I go to the row and I might buy one or two Navy sweaters, but I can't wear anything else. I know they're little like me, but I don't look good in that. It's not my style. Yeah, they like to drown in everything. So I'm five eight. They're clothes are great on me. Yeah, no, exactly. I don't, I don't look good in anything trendy. So I don't deal with it, but I love really nice things. Even though I wear Uniqlo and, you know, I found my a couple perfect white t-shirts, which I buy in bulk. I also have a great shoe closet I buy, you know, I've got my Hermes. I always forget what the sandals are, what the name of it's like, Chepra or. Yeah, yeah, yeah. How do you say it? I don't really. Yeah. So I have those in three colors and I have a lot of platforms because I can't wear pointy shoes anymore. It just is too uncomfortable. Have you seen the Hermes? It looks like sort of like a Teva or a Choco that they did this season. It's really good. Oh, I will have to, I will definitely have to check, but I am searching for tailored pants. I mean, when Phoebe Filo was at Celine, I had every single silk shirt, which I brought to a tailor and he shortened them for me. They're still in my closet. So, you know, I have, I keep a lot of old beautiful things that I'm like, I'm about to go on the real, real to see like who was selling any great trousers because I'm having little trouble with the clothes that are on the market right now. Have you gone to Bergdorf to see the Phoebe Filo brand stuff and tried anything on? It's too big. They're too, they're, and they're a little, and they're, I mean, I think they're a little trendy. Yeah. And I love her. My dream was always to be the makeup artist for her brand because she really inspired Jones Road, the no makeup, cool clothes, you know, weird earring. So, you know, it's still, I just need normal. I, it's kind of bizarre, but I need normal. I feel you. I, I feel very similarly and I can see why you have Mickey ear friends because this is a conversation. He will also bring in the, how does anyone charge this while wearing an Hermes puffer? Oh, I, I, I am more than happy, you know, I'm not happy, but I've gotten comfortable with, you know, the couple of my purchases, my handbags that are so expensive, you know, it takes a minute to get over the sticker shock, but I love them. So, I'm happy to have them. And I would, I would buy a few gorgeous outfits every season. I would buy three suits. So now I'm, you know, trying to figure out who's going to make me the, the suits that no one makes anymore. Like, you know, I'm friends with Todd Snyder. Maybe he'll make it for me or maybe I'll find a beautiful Italian tailor to do it. So, because I can't find it. Yeah. I feel like trousers are a big industry issue. Generally, I needed a pair I bought on sale, obviously, but an Alaya jacket over the holidays and to wear to work events or whatever. Right. And I wanted black pants to match and Alaya didn't have exactly what for me was right, probably like a little too fashiony on the bottom, but to find a black trouser that looked correct was near impossible. I still actually haven't found exactly the right one. I usually just wear it with jeans. I wear everything with jeans. I mean, I have probably 10 or 12 Chanel jackets in my wardrobe. I mean, you never get rid of them. So I wear that with jeans, you know, when I'm in Florida doing something, I have my white jeans with my, I actually bought a salmon color Chanel jacket, which you'll never see me wear except in Palm Beach, but it's the perfect thing. Perfect. And every, you know, and they're not even making those classic jackets. Do you remember when they had that beautiful black jacket exhibition? Why wouldn't they sell those black jackets? Like, well, here's hoping they're going back to it. Yeah, please, please, please. So this search for the perfect thing and just quality and you said normal, which I think is a great, let's make the word normal feel more special, but it is to me, it is special because it's classic. And by the way, I go on Pinterest. I go on Pinterest and I start gathering all these different things and they're all like boy style, you know. Yeah. And then they lead you to these things and I buy them and they come in my mail and I'm like, oh my God, thank God, I have an assistant because you better return these. They're terrible. I know. Oh God, Instagram ad stuff. But so this kind of ladders back to Jones Road and you said it was inspired by a bit by Celine and old Celine and Phoebe. But what is, you've done so much. You made this brand that it's still a great brand. Like they're still good product. What made you want to, you're doing all these fun projects with your husband that are probably very involved. What made you want to do another makeup line and what is the ethos behind this and how is it different from what you did in the past? First of all, I wasn't done. I thought honestly, there's more to teach. I really wanted to teach women number one, how to age naturally. I am in a minority, but I do feel the groundswell that it's happening. And so I feature a lot of women of different ages and I just really love skin. I love health and wellness. And so I wanted to create products that didn't look like makeup. And it's so different than the first brand. And it's first of all, it's not the same brand that I, when I was there, it's very different. They've gone in whatever their direction is and that's fine. For me, I wanted to create products that had formulas that when you put them on, they just disappear. We have this foundation that is called what the foundation or WTF. Because when you put it on, you're like, what is this? Like you don't look like you're wearing foundation. And I don't care if you are 24 or you have lines all over your face. You just instantly look better. And to me, that's what makeup should be. And I find most traditional makeup makes you look worse. How did you figure out formulas this time? Did you work with people you'd worked with in the past? Did you seek out someone new to figure this stuff out? Because there is so much more competition now than there was the first time you did this. I started completely over. I didn't bring anyone from the old country, as I call it. I started all over with the labs, with the people that worked for me. First of all, my son is right now running Jones Road with another woman. And my daughter-in-law is the head of brand. And our product development team, I mean, I'm in my mid-60s, or maybe a little bit above that. And these kids are, they just have this different thing, which I love. The energy that, yeah, we can do that. No problem. Bobby, we got this. All right, you want to do this? Let's do it. So it kind of gives me the energy to create new things. And I'm really proud of the formulas that we have in Jones Road. They're like, I mean, look, I know it's my brand and every beauty founder will say it, but they're just better. Yeah. And what has the feedback been from consumers? I'm sure there were a lot of people like Afibi Filo or Adi Slaman that followed you because they're fans of you. But what have you learned from this new generation of consumers? Well, I mean, it's easy to know because it's everybody's so vocal. I mean, we have a Facebook group of 50 plus thousand people that it's called Rodes, like Jones Road Rodes. And it's like, I don't even have to go on there anymore because if someone has an issue with the product and can't get it to work, someone will say, oh, let me show you how to do it. So we have them as incredible feedback. And I just hear from people when they stop me, it's just really positive. And every once in a while on TikTok or wherever, I don't go on Reddit because I can handle, I just opened a sub stack that was enough. But I hear, oh my God, the balm feels like Vaseline. I'm like, well, maybe you're using too much of it. So I'm always trying to educate people how to use it and say, not everyone likes that on their face. So if you don't like it, then maybe go for a powder bronzer instead. So I listen and I try to give an answer back. When you think about like, writing this brand independently versus you sold the first one so quickly being part of a group, there's probably a lot that's really much more satisfying about this. But what makes it harder? It, beauty's a little different in that you're not opening tons of standalone stores. I think like Mickey would say this, when he started all these companies, he started Madewell or he started Old Navy, the retail network that they had made it easy for it to blow up really, really fast. And I'm sure in the same way, like having that financial backing of a bigger group gives different types of freedom. But what has it been like being an entrepreneur this time around and going on your own? Well, how about this? From the first couple months, we were profitable. We haven't taken any investments. We've opened six stores so far. A seventh one is just started construction. We are opening standalone stores. I don't know if we'll get to how many my son would like to open, but we are moving in that direction. We have one like full on department store and that's Liberty in London. Oh, wow. Because there's only one, yeah, there's only one Liberty. We'd love to have some couple of freestanding stores in London also. And the freedom of doing what we're doing and not having layers is just so incredible. We talk about something and we get it done. What do I miss about having this big structure? I mean, sure was nice when someone was paying for my suites at the Conan. But I'm so lucky to have had the experience. I mean, I stayed at the brand for 22 years, so it helped me grow and scale and learn everything. But the beginning and the middle were amazing. The end was tough, like anyone that has any job. So for me, it's just so nice to be able to start all over to bring expertise into what I've learned, but also what I've learned is not necessary to do. Rachel Strugeitz, who I know you know, who doesn't do any sort of public speaking, so which is why I'm interviewing you and not Rachel. I also wanted to, but she doesn't, I love to tease her about it. She doesn't like doing that stuff. But we talk about this quite a bit in, we talk beauty versus fashion. And obviously the last 30 years of the fashion industry has been about taking the business more and more and more direct. And multi-brand retail, as your friend, Richard Baker knows, has become more challenging at every price or what have you because you make more money direct. But with beauty, there is this narrative that you really do need a lot of multi-brand retail to be able to scale to a certain point. And it sounds like I know you have liberty, and I know you can get Jones Road on different marketplaces and things like that. But it sounds like you've really invested in the direct retail and having standalone beauty stores, which benefit has those, some other brands have them. But it's not the typical way to do it even now in this era. How, what have you learned from that? And why are you all, like you said your son would love to have even more stores. Why are you all bullish on that direct to consumer strategy? I mean, it's really simple because we're still growing. Our growth is real and it's healthy and there's, it's not slowing down. And so there's no reason that we have to do that. Trust me, right now our stores are probably 5% of our overall. So it's never going to be huge. You know, you hear about what they're doing in the store and it's fantastic and I'm so proud of them. But then you see what we do day to day and it's, you can't compare it. So I think it just is a really nice add-on to our direct to consumer because people do like to go in and we often have lines out the door because you can't see Jones Road in every, in your hometown. So you come to New York or Montclair, that's like the Mecca or Palm Beach and women go directly to Jones Road sometimes from the airplane because they just want to see what the hubbub is about. And they want to actually see what pencils match their skin or what Miracle Balm is recommended. And so it's great for that, but it's never going to be, you know, I'm not, and I'm not going to say never. I mean, right now we don't have a need to go into retail and you have to, you know, believe me that I get emails and calls from presidents of the stores since I know them for so many years and we're not ready. And you don't think Richard Baker is constantly saying, you know, Bobby. So, and I'm like, no, Richard, not yet. I'm sure maybe when he has his whole empire that's about right the FTC God willing. Yeah, exactly. Do you have any desire to sell it someday just to like to have the exit? Do you think that would feel good? No, because what am I going to do until, you know, my team members want me to sell it or my son or my husband or my daughter in law? Because honestly, like, I really wish I could sit here and tell you I have these incredible hobbies. I don't. I love working. I get energized. I love doing things. I don't know how to do. I mean, I was the beauty editor in chief of Yahoo Beauty for a couple years. I don't know how to type. I remember my friend Britt Abu Talib worked with you there. Yes. And I knew the other the person who replaced her. I forget her name, but yeah. I mean, again, it's different than it was. But, you know, I got to work under Marissa Meyer when she was there. So, you know, a lot of interesting things I've gotten to do and I'm not opposed to more interesting things. But Jones Road has just become such a jewel. I mean, if you want to know, it makes me happy besides my family. And I have a granddaughter now. I have a two year old granddaughter. So between Jones Road and Lily, you know, there it's there kind of filling my cup these days. You've had so many iterations of your career. Like looking back, it's very cohesive, but you've done so much and you're still so curious, curious and on it. And what do you do you think the curiosity is sort of the key to being propulsive and being able to move forward because I see so many people that are sort of stuck in a place and you don't feel stuck. Yeah. I don't get I'm not I have a very optimistic, naive way of looking at things. I mean, I'm probably naivete is probably a superpower. But I don't have this can't work thing. And if it doesn't work, I just say, oh, let me do something else. I don't care if it doesn't work. To me, it's not a failure. It's like, all right, that didn't work. Let me do it differently or something. So I don't know. And I'm also like a health fanatic. Look, I'm 67. I'm just going to say it. And if I wasn't a health fanatic, I wouldn't have the energy or the stamina to do it. Yeah, and I do. Speaking of, I forgot the first thing we usually ask people is, what did you have for breakfast? What did I have for breakfast? Yeah, I was wondering why I was so excited. I jumped right in. What did you have for breakfast? Well, I actually I made a shake. So I have a couple of health coaches or one of my health coaches from SWW told me what to do. And I start with water. I don't use almond milk anymore, but I use protein powder, chia, frozen. I have a whole freezer full of fruit. So I did a couple different berries for fiber. I did this amazing protein powder called flavor city, which I could just put water in. Delicious. Oh my god, every flavor. I'm buying it. It's honestly way protein powder. It actually you could use it just with water and it's delicious. I make a hot cocoa in the afternoon with it with hot water, put a little whipped cream on organic whipped cream. Perfect. So I had the shake for breakfast and hopefully one of my son or my husband will have ordered something for lunch. But it did keep me full for a lot of hours. I'm inspired. I'm buying this protein powder. Oh, and AG1. Have you heard about those greens? I do. My husband is a big user. I swear by it. I do. I have it before I have my espresso in the morning with half and half or sometimes if there's a heavy cream, I'll go for that. Because just a touch of it and that helps alkalize my system. So I don't feel the effect of caffeine. And I'm such a health nut. I went back to school after I left Bobby Brown Cosmetics to IIN, Institute of Integrative Nutrition. So I actually have a degree, but I don't really have any clients. Clothing of time. It's on my eye. I'm an iPad girl. I did it in the iPad in my sauna. It's amazing. I just found a holistic MD here in LA, which is obviously it's not that hard to find, but it's hard to find the right one. Very into her. It's great. Honestly, it's so important because integrative like health is important. Regular doctors are important too, but you know, and ultimately you make the decisions. But and if you're not feeling 100%, then you just try to figure out why and what you could do with it. Bobby, thanks for being such an inspiration. On like a lot of different levels. Well, thank you. I really love, love, love your podcast and your articles and thank you. It's so sweet. Yeah, you guys are killing it. Puck. Thank you. We're trying. But great. I know Rachel definitely wants to do something with you soon. So we'll be in touch. Yeah, we're not. We're not selling Rachel. So yeah. Yeah. I love Rachel. She only wishes. Yeah.
