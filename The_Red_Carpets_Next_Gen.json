Pretty Friday, friends. New York Fashion Week is over, over, over. I guess it was over on Wednesday, but these things drag on. I missed more than I typically miss. I had a ton of stuff related to the book I wrote with Chantal Fernandez that comes out October 8th. It's called Selling Sexy Victoria's Secret and the Unraveling of an American Icon. Please pre-order it so I don't have to pay back my advance. We had tons of stuff there. Puck had its first off-site, which was really in the offices, but it was the first time the whole company is getting together. It was really, really great. I love Puck. Very pro. Please subscribe. I know you're already a subscriber, but if you're not, you better do it immediately. And I missed things I really wanted to see. I missed Luar. I missed Totem. I missed Rachel Comey. I missed Ola Johnson. I missed the board that I'm like, I had RSVP too and had to not go. And I feel bad about it, but the good thing is I did see a lot of you, which was really nice. I thought it was an excellent season in New York. The weather really helped, but the clothes were good too. And I'm excited to pick the conversation back up in Milan and Paris. We're going to chat, chat, chat. We're going to eat. We're going to maybe drink. I don't like being puffy, so probably not that much, but I look forward to seeing you. And this weekend I am back in LA to hang out with my family and my little baby. He's not a baby anymore, but I need to see him and cuddle him. Justin Time for Emmy's Traffic. I don't, is there even traffic during these award shows? I have no idea, but I will find out this weekend because I'm actually invited to one of the parties, the HBO party. I don't know if I should say where it is. I don't want people to show up and try to infiltrate it. I don't know how that works in Hollywood. It probably doesn't work like that, but it's not like a fashion show where you can't tell anyone the location, but I'm going to go, I think, if I can, if I'm not too exhausted. It's on Sunday night, obviously. So if you're one of the crossover listeners and you plan to be there, say hi. Love to meet you. And the next time I send one of these dispatches, I'll be on my way to Milan. And before that, though, I am so excited that Danielle came on the pod. She, I am just, I really like her as a person. It doesn't matter. If she does something bad, you'll know about it. You know, I don't play favorites in that way, but she won't do anything bad. She's like the loveliest human being alive. And, you know, to me, she's interesting because she's one of these celebrities who, she's of this new generation. It feels like she's less of a stylist and more of a, this, I know this is silly, but she's more of a thought partner. Like it doesn't feel like she's so bound by these advertising contracts. And I know some of her girls probably have them or at least agree some sort of arrangement or ambassadorships with these brands, but she just, it just feels like she really likes fashion. She understands what kind of fashion they really like. And so I'm excited to see what Greta Lee and IEL is Solange. I mean, she dresses so many people. She also just started dressing Carly Claus, which I think is really cool and interesting and good for Carly Claus in this part of her career. She becomes a media mogul that I love tracking. Also Danielle and my taste very much a line, I would say. So like I like everything she likes. I'm the follower here, not the leader. If I was ever going to like a very fancy event, I think I would ask her like last year at the CFDAs, she came with IEL and maybe someone else, I don't know, but she had on like the perfect dress by the row and it was just perfect. And she's just, she has great taste. And she loves clothes. So it's really nice to just talk something like that through. I do have a correction for the podcast at the beginning when we talk about breakfast. Danielle mentions a sourdough brand and I got very excited that she was talking about bread seriously, but I think she was talking about something else. I think she maybe was talking about bread alone or something, but if you, if you're celiac or gluten free, I highly recommend checking out bread seriously. I have a celiac person in my household and have done much research. I've even made my own sourdough bread. Don't have time for that anymore. That was what lockdowns were for. But anyway, check it out. I hope you enjoy this conversation with Danielle and have a great weekend. Danielle Goldberg, welcome to fashion people. Thank you so much. I'm so honored to be invited. I'm so honored to have you. I know you don't do a lot of this kind of stuff, so I'm, I'm grateful. Have you done a podcast before? I did the, the Vogue one right after awards season. That's so fun. I'm, I'm doing it from my book. That's so fun. Yeah, I'm excited. Chloe's so good. I think not sadly, but I think I'm actually Nicole Phelps is interviewing us because we interviewed her for it, which is even is great too. But I am a big Chloe Malfin. Big time. So first question we always ask for the Friday show, what do you have for breakfast? You know, it's so funny. I'm a listener of fashion people. So I was actually really excited about this question because I'm a big breakfast person. It's the best. I had sourdough toast from, do you know bread alone? Yes. It's gluten free, right? Well, it's like this, they have this San Francisco sourdough bread that I'm obsessed with. Yeah. And they've made it impossible to find. Like I will like buy, if I see it, I'll like buy it and like hordes and like put it in my freezer because it's like they don't. I want to like just put out this complaint on your podcast in hopes that those would just in more stores. Yes. But yeah, sourdough toast, two eggs over easy. I'm with avocado. I'm a pretty, I like a breakfast. Breakfast is probably my favorite meal. This is a very me breakfast. I almost always have a sourdough toast with some sort of egg and maybe avocado or I'll mix in like an arugula with the egg. Okay. Yeah. Just to like give it some spice and also feel like I ate some greens, but the bread alone thing really interesting. So my husband is celiac and it's gluten free. Yeah. Which I don't, I mean, you can't, it's so good. I'm not gluten free, but I don't like. And it's really well done. Like I have sampled many gluten free toasts and breads and it's one of the best, especially one that you can occasionally buy at the grocery store. But it's interesting in San Francisco, I think you can still buy it at buy right in San Francisco, which is probably like my number two grocery store in the whole country. It's a really great grocery store. And we were just there and I don't think my husband bought any. But yeah, we, I used to order it online when we lived in New York. Same. And buy it in bulk. But now it's like, now when I go to like, I like have gone to the website and they're like, you can buy it at like our stores upstate. And I'm just like, I don't like, where did that, where did it go? Yeah. It's interesting with all the distribution and of grocery distribution and how that works. And it's sort of like fashion, actually, and that the volume is so high, so you can make some money, but it's actually really hard to have a giant business unless you're owned by one of the conglomerates. It's very similar. That's actually insane, but also like makes a lot of sense. Yeah. Like you can have a basically a $10 million food business and it be fairly profitable. But you have to deal with like having a relationship with all the stores and the stores give priority to certain vendors because they pay more, they pay for space. It's the exact same thing. We could spend this entire podcast talking about bread alone. Exactly. Exactly. I mean, there is always, you could always ladder things back to the fashion industry. That's for sure. That's definitely true for me. So let's, I wanted to have you on on this episode in particular because it's going to run the Friday before the Emmys. Fun. So it's like we'll be talking and also everybody will be real sick of fashion week. So it'll be time to catch up on some celebrity dressing and Hollywood and all that stuff. And I, I'm so happy I'll be home for the Emmys. Please invite me to your Emmys parties, people. This will run the Friday before. So there's still time, but you, I, I have really, I've been watching your career for the last several years and really admire what you've done as, as a stylist, a lot of red carpet stuff, but you do obviously do a lot of other projects as well. And I think that you represent this new generation or just this new phase of celebrity styling and wanted to sort of dig into your process and how you see that world and what you think, how it relates to the fashion industry at large. So maybe we can start with sort of how did you end up styling celebrities? Cause I don't, the other thing is like, I don't think of you maybe cause you live in New York and you are of the fashion world. I don't really think of you as a quote unquote celebrity stylist in caps because you're not like that's like a specific generation of people who did a specific job and your job looks different than that. So, but how did you get into working with actors? I guess would be a better way to put it. I mean, truly like long story short. And I think that you and I are a similar age where we were like, you know, editorial was like, Kane. Yeah. I just wanted to be in magazine. I wanted to be an editor. I wanted to be a sitting editor at a magazine and I actually was working at Jane magazine and, you know, it folded and Jane was like my favorite magazine. I couldn't believe I was working there. You know, it was like, okay, this is the magazine I'm going to stay at. Yeah. And it folded and I had the opportunity to assist editor at interview named Annabelle Tolman. Oh, yes. Yes. Annabelle Tolman was the fashion director of interview and was slowly starting to take on celebrity. So she was looking for an assistant to help her kind of with both things. And to be honest, I didn't know very much about celebrity, but I was just really obsessed with her as an editor and wanted to work with her. So it was kind of like, I'll take it all. And I ended up falling into a lot of the work that was celebrity oriented and pretty soon after she left interview and started to celebrity styling. And this was like the days of like Rachel Zough and kind of when celebrity starting was becoming more of like at the forefront. Because when I was growing up, that wasn't a job. No, you know, I definitely didn't, you know, know about it. And I think you and I had bonded over the fact that I interned for Andrea Lieberman. Oh, yes. Yes. When I was interning for her, I like was just like in a Blacktown card dropping off returns. But she was like really to me like the first celebrity stylist that I was aware of. It's always so funny to think of her that way, because now I know, you know, she has this big giant brand, but she did one, Stephanie and she did J.Lo J.Lo. Oh my God. In the mid aughts when that was like, she was she's incredible. She's always been ahead of her time. So I think ALC speaks to that. You know, she's always just been someone to look up to. And what did it was? So you start you sort of fell into it. But I fell into it. And then she had the opportunity to style Mary Kate and Ashley for their book, The Influences. It was like a book tour. And me being like a young 20 something in New York was losing her mind over the fact that there was this opportunity to work with them. And I did that job. And I just handed off with them and ended up working with them for a bit. And that was kind of when I went off on my own. But I wouldn't even call that celebrity styling because it was just really working with them. Yeah. While I was working with them, there was a brand that they had where Laura Harrier was the model for it. And she and I just became friendly. Oh, that's interesting. And we just stayed in touch and she was trying to be an actress. And in that time, I really I was styling a lot of runway shows. I was doing a lot of consulting. I was really obsessed with doing brand work. And she called me and was like, I'm going to be in Spider-Man. And I'm going to be doing a press store. And I did that press store. And that was, you know, I don't know when the film came out. I guess like 2016, I want to say. So that was almost like seven or eight years ago. And that was like my first time really doing celebrity, like the way that I know it now of like having like, you know, a press store and having looks and working with designers. And I kind of just did it my way. I did it the way that I wanted to see it. And I think that's what I kind of think of when I think of any of the work I do. It's really just what I would want to see on the carpet. Yeah. Whether that be the designer or the actress or the way it's styled. It's just what I'm hoping to see. Because I think that's ultimately what it is. It's like you look at the red carpet as like, you know, everybody has an opinion in fashion. So people like, oh, I wish I saw like someone was wearing this dress or I wish she wore her hair like that or I wish. And I think that's kind of where it started. And I felt like people responded to that. And what Laura and I did. And that was really the beginning of my celebrity styling space. But I do agree with you that I wouldn't necessarily classify myself as a celebrity stylist. It's more so that I mainly focus on the red carpet. So can you walk me through and I'm sure it's different with every person that you work with. But and it's maybe like how you did it that first press tour compared to how you work work on a press tour now. But like, did you and Laura have a conversation like, what do you want your look to be or were you or is it more like, I saw this on a runway. I think you'd be cute in these kinds of things. Like how does the conversation happen? And then how do you go to brands and like propose it to them and all that stuff? You're like, how do you do your job? Yeah, yeah. I mean, because because I know I hear from brands like you send a lot of emails yourself. I'm sure you have help. But like, I do all my own market in terms of like the close. It's really important to me. Yeah. I mean, that's my job. But I also definitely am very specific about the things that I want and I don't maybe send kind of a quote unquote like vibe. You know, if it's a if it's a big moment for my client, it's probably just one look that I like become obsessed with. But to go back to what you were asking, I can say that the way that I did it with Laura for that first time would be the same as it is now because I feel like I like sharpen my tools. Yeah. You know, I think that I've gotten much more concise in the way that I approach my work, but each of the girls that I work with, I essentially have an ongoing file for each of them, whether it's a current runway collection, a reference image from the past, a still from a movie girl that I see on the street, a guy I see on the street. It's really just a never ending file of things that remind me of them or things that I think that would be cool for them. And that file is something I reference every single time something is coming up. Like, for example, like for Greta, just to like make it a little bit more clear. Greta Lee. Greta Lee, sorry. Who you and Greta is the biggest star in the world in my mind now. Same. But it has been also for me for like the last 10 years. Everyone else found out. You know, my husband went to college with her. So many people went to college with her. Nor am I like how many people are going to Northwestern? A lot of people went there because we had dinner at our new friend's house. We were invited to dinner at these people's house last night and the guy, one of the guys, Kevin, I think his name is Kevin. I don't want to get his name wrong. We were at his house. We just got invited last night. It was very sweet. But we're going to buy the time this comes out. Kevin and I are going to have had lunch and we're going to be friends. But he went to college with her too. He's like, oh, my friends were all Northwestern theater people. And I was like, are you friends with Greta Lee? Yeah. It's crazy. It's crazy. She's so many people know her, but it's also like to know her is truly to love her. Like she's someone you meet that you just like, don't forget. Huge fan. I'm so excited for her success. And I do think that some of it is, has to do with you and her and the way you work together on her fashion stuff, because she clearly has, is fashion literate. But you guys are having, you're having a great time. But anyway, you, I interrupted, go back to how you do this. No, well, what I was going to say is just for example, you know, it's just a really interesting way of looking at it because I've known Greta and worked with her for the last 10 years. And, but when we were starting to do the press for past lives, everyone was essentially meeting her on like a global scale for the first time. Yeah. So there was a great deal of importance on all of these moments and especially like the initial ones. And I think a great example of like kind of reverting to that like file that I had of her for her was when the Academy Galactic was coming up and like that was going to be her first like huge red carpet, you know, outside of like her being at like the Berlin Film Festival for past lives. And I had had all these images of Tina Chow. Like in her file that had just, and to me, she's, you know, somebody who I referenced just in my own personal style. She's just immaculate. And so she was someone we had discussed. And that was kind of like the, those images in her throwing parties at the original Mr. Chow on 57th Street and the way she dressed and the way she wore her hair was the reference for the Academy Gal look, you know, so we had these images. She and I discussed them. We shared them with hair and makeup and we shared them with Jonathan and his team, you know, and a silhouette. Jonathan Anderson, Louie. Jonathan Anderson at Louie and his team. I'm looking at you. So I keep, no, I know. I know I, do you ever listen to SmartLess? No, I'm not, I don't listen to a lot of podcasts. My husband listens to a ton of them. I listen to too many, but Sean Hayes does this thing during SmartLess where he says, I think his sister's who lives in like the middle of the country is named Lisa. So in the middle, and you can tell some of them they add in later. It's like, for Lisa, this is, this is who this person is. Yeah. So I'm just doing the Sean Hayes bit. I, I assume there's not a lot of overlap between fashion people on SmartLess, but you never know. No, never know. Anyway, Jonathan, so you shared with his team. Yeah, he would send it to the Louie V8 team and Jonathan Anderson and then, then they come back to us with, you know, and it's like, that's kind of where things build from, but she was a huge reference point throughout the entire run. Of award season. So it's kind of like having these little winks that are really between us. And if people get it, that's really exciting to us, you know, and I think that there were the same thing with like IO going to the critics choice. And, you know, at that point, I'd worked with IO for four or five months. And in her file, I had all these images of whooping Goldberg in the nineties going to award shows, you know, so it's like, it was so exciting. Once you wore that look and I remember, and we didn't say the reference. And I remember another stylist, Gabby Creeper Johnson, like wrote on it, like whoopie Goldberg, like and full. And it's so fun for people to see it. And I don't know, I guess the best way to say it is like that they see it and they like feel that reference because that means that you don't want to make it chew on the nose, obviously. Yeah. This show is brought to you by Boca. Boca knows that when you take care of your mouth, your whole body benefits. That's why the Crete elevated oral care that fortifies your teeth.

We're two of the biggest red carpet presents in the past two years and their careers exploded during the period that you were working with them really closely. And there's actually my friends just started this romance novel company or romance genre imprint. And it's really funny. There's a mention of I.O. Stylist and it's not you. It's like a fake person styling. Who's a character in the book. And it just, it made me think of you. That's so good. I love that. But their careers sort of exploded during this time. But you said you've been working with Greta for what eight years or something like that. For ten years. For ten years. Greta and I worked together for ten years. So how did you all meet? Greta and I met in like a very random way. Like I, it's a really big kind of like reminder that like no job. Like you should really like do your best at like wherever you're at in your career. Yeah. We met when I was on like a random job for like a comedy sketch show. Oh, interesting. It was very random. And she and I just like connected and she and I just exchanged numbers and stayed in touch. And to me, I was like, she's just like the coolest girl. Like I loved how she dressed and she had such a cool vibe. And she was like, I don't have anything coming up right now. But like, you know, maybe we could do something together. And I was like, I would love to. And a lot of the relationships I've had and ways I met clients, it's usually something that's just genuinely like that innocent. Where we kind of just meet in passing and we just kind of meet and passing. And like that was kind of how that's how it happened with Laura. The second client I ever had after Laura was Bretta. And yeah, she would have things here and there. And it was always fun to work with her. But the style that everyone's like seeing from her now is always there. Yeah. It's just made it more exciting because we had access to so much. And that's what made it so incredible because she wears clothes so well. Is it important to you that they have a sense of style or an interest in fashion for it to be a comfortable pairing? Well, I think that there has to be a respect for fashion, you know, because that really is a respect for the work that I do. So I want, anyone I work with, I want them to be interested in fashion. I think that that would be like silly to not, you know, think that and also have a respect for like the clothing they're wearing because I think that's really important. Yeah. You know, and I think any girl that I've worked with already has a sense of style of their own. And it's really, and it doesn't even necessarily mean it's the clothing that they wear. Yeah. You know, it could be just them as a person. I find that like when I meet with girls about potentially working with them, I need to, there needs to be something about them that inspires me in some way that makes me excited, that forces me to start to think about ways that I see them. And if that's not happening during the conversation, then I feel like I would be doing a disservice if I were to work with them. I need to feel like I can see, you know, what we can do together. As your profile has risen in the last few years especially, do you find, are you getting more imbound? I'm sure you're getting more imbound, but, you know, the way that, the way I always thought it worked or it has worked quite a bit in red carpet, is like the agency or a manager, manager is our friend Max Stein, who is- We love Max. Is the architect of my entire life. You and me both. He is the best. But he, I'm gonna have him on at some point. You should. I'm afraid, but you should. I want to have him on on one of the Mondays, so that he can go through the news and say what he really thinks about everything. Literally what I'm afraid of. It'll be so funny. It'll make for a great episode. Yes, he'll need to have, he'll need to be PR'd before he comes on for sure. A little media training. Yes. But I don't know how I'll involve Max's with that kind of stuff with you. I know he works on brand stuff with you too, but what I imagine is, Dan Constable gets a new, who works at UTA, who's sort of like the go-to fashion. I love Dan. Who is a great fashion agent, because he works at the Hollywood agency, but he looks like he should be in fashion. I sat next to him at a dinner once, knew of him, but I'd never met him. I was like, who's this stylist I've never met this guy before, and then realized it was Dan Constable. I was so excited. But he gets a cool person and he's smart about, is it like people like Dan coming to you and saying, I have this new girl or, I know that they work like that with the brands a lot. They'll go to Mew Mew or something and be like, I have this cool new girl that you all need to watch for the next three years or when have you. Or is it still much more like you meet these people at a party or at a shoot or something? Yeah, I definitely am not meeting anyone at a party. I'm not going on a party. But I think it really varies. I'm a big proponent of people being with the right person and not just taking on a client just because I'm a stylist and they're an actress. So I definitely have those conversations with someone like Dan, who will be like, oh, so and so. And I'm like, you know, who would be really good for her and it would be like another stylist. If I don't feel like it's the right fit for me. Because like I said before, I really feel like it's a gut reaction for me when someone comes up and it's really just like an immediate response of like, I feel really inspired by this person. I think I could do something really special for them. Because if I can't do that for them, then like, what's the point of hiring me? You know, I think it's so important for me to feel completely invested in the story that we're telling together. And I say this quite often when I speak to the girls that I work with of like, if you're texting me at 2am about a shoe, like I need to care as much as you do about like a shoe you're wearing the next day and all of them are like, the joke about this is that you're the one texting us about the shoe at 2am because like you're the one thinking about it. You know, like I think that I need to be 100% invested in the year, like the tour we're doing or the promo or whatever it is I need to be all in. And a great example of that would be, you know, when I.O. at Avery's team reached out to Max and prior to us working together, I had watched, you know, The Bear of course and loved it. But I remember just always seeing her on the red carpet and thinking, she's so cool. Yeah. You know, I love and I love like how she looks. I love like, you know what she's wearing. She just has such a great sense of style. So I was just so flattered when she reached out because I was so excited about the idea of working together because I already felt like she, she definitely had, you know, made an impact on me when she was on the carpet. I was aware of her because I thought that she was just carried herself beautifully. Yeah. And I was just so excited to speak with her in a minute. We started talking and, you know, she let me know kind of what she was hoping to make happen. It was so clear to me that like I could do that for her. And when that happens, it's like, it's just like immediate. Like I'm all in. And I think that it's very all or nothing for me. Yeah. Well, I think what you do really well is you make the people you dress look like themselves. I really appreciate you saying that because it's the most important thing to me. And I think it is the evolution of that, that medium is that it started that no one really had anyone. And then they had people who were just putting them in pretty gowns, which is fine. But it's not, they all often looked uncomfortable. And now you're seeing, and I think Kamala Harris with Leslie Fremar, you see this too. She looks like herself and Jacob and I, this is, we're recording this ahead of time. And Jacob Gallagher and I talked about this in, right after the Democratic National Convention. Like she just looks, she looks like her herself. She looks awesome, but it's not like, oh, I look uncomfortable in a weird dress or would have you. And you are a master of that. Like I can't think of anyone who you work with who doesn't seem to be into the clothes that they're wearing. What do you think has changed in image making and the red carpet that this is the sort of phase people have gone in? Because when you entered this business, when Annabelle was doing it, it was still a really new business. Like Rachel Zoo was famous, but pretty much no one else was. And I remember Annabelle worked with Scarlett Johansson, right? She did. Yeah. That was kind of the basis of like the work we were doing. And it was definitely like a whole new world. And I think that I personally, when I would think of red carpet styling, my only references are from when nobody has a style. Because that was what I found to be inspiring to me. And I think it's because, you know, and why you see photos of like Julia Roberts with like, you know, her curly hair and like a suit and tie that like Armani center, you know, or, you know, the reference of whoopie Goldberg, like we had talked about like that inspired I.O.'s critic choice look. I think that so much of the work that the girls that I work with do is playing a character. Yeah. So when they're on the red carpet, it's the one opportunity they have to be themselves. And so to me, as I start working with each girl, my only goal is to sort of champion that person that I'm getting to know and showcase it on a red carpet for them. And for the people watching them in the best way I know how. And so I think that when I'm, you know, looking for a look for a client for like a big moment, it's really when I see something that reminds me of them. It's not like, oh, this is like the coolest dress from like the coolest, you know, it's really my focal point at all times is the girl that I'm working for. Yeah. And I think that it means the most when people see that. But really what means everything is when I put them in that dress and they're like, you just see their whole body language like, relax. Yeah. And somehow it's like this ornate gown, but they feel completely themselves. Totally. And that is like the, the aha. Well, that's the moment, you know, and when we're in the fitting and I can see the way that they're moving and like, you know, all those things. It's everything because you know that it's going to look incredible on the carpet and it's going to be the quote unquote, like best dress because they feel incredible. Because that's, I mean, it might sound corny, but that's what it's about. Yeah. You know, it's like you feeling good. So like when I see a gown and it speaks to me and I'm like, oh my God, that's so Greta or, you know, that's, you know, so I or whoever it is, I'm working with the time. It's like, that's why it translates. And it's why I think also the way that I fit is so edited because if it is only pieces that are reminding me of them, there really shouldn't be very much there. Yeah. Yeah. And that's really interesting. So how much are you doing a lot of custom or are you looking more editorial looks? I think it varies. I mean, I think for the Emmys, we're doing custom for both I and Greta. But, you know, for when Greta was doing that Tron D23 promo, yeah, I was like, you know, she'd send me some images behind the scenes from the movie. And I was starting to kind of get inspired at like what we could do that's going to kind of kick things off. And I knew that I wanted to have something that felt like a bit stronger and a little bit more like aggressive for like the intro. And I might be butchering the name, but Hoda Kova, which is like the designer she wears, was like the shoe boots. As a corset and these like chino skirts, like something like that was, I guess, like an editorial look like for the going to go like red carpet. But for an event like the Emmys were definitely like, I'm pretty much done. Yeah. You know, it's like, we just need to put the dresses on to make sure everything fits. But in terms of like the design and all the kind of like details, like there'll be you have to kind of get that done before August because everybody clothes. Yeah. So custom is my favorite because it really allows you to work with the Italians of these incredible houses. Yeah. So I don't know that this answered your question at all. No, I did. I mean, I'm interested in the custom because your stuff looks very editorial still. So I think that's just like where I come from though. Yeah. I think like that's something that like I definitely I'm somebody that is completely in awe of designers. Like those are my like, I don't get starstruck with like actors or musicians like designers are really. Yeah. For me. Yeah. Who do you love right now? Who who are you inspired by and or who would you love to work with? Who have you? I mean, I'm sure you've worked with all of them at this point. But well, I think, you know, it goes without saying that I obviously enjoy job and Anderson's work a great deal. Yeah. And I worked with him so many years ago actually on like a hot pink gown with Laura also for like a sag. Then I'll never forget it. But I've gotten to work with him a great deal over the past, you know, two years, obviously. Mrs. Prada is like the ultimate to me in terms of just somebody that's just stayed true to who they are and created like timeless pieces. And I love Raf in terms of like also like their collaboration. I was always a same fan of Raf as a designer, but him working with her. I can't I truly can't like I I reread that interview that the two of them had. I forget the mag. What was the magazine? Yeah, I don't remember, but it was great. It was like, you know, like a very obscure, like cool magazine. Yeah. They did like an interview interviewing one another and I reread it all the time. Like I they're just beyond. I also am such a huge fan of both of theirs and love them together. I don't I don't think everybody does, but I do. I know, but that's okay. I honestly think that's a good sign. You know, you want a little bit of push-pull. Yeah, I agree. You don't want everyone to agree that something's good. I mean that and that can be said for Red Carpid too. Like it's like you just want people to have a reaction, you know, totally.

So if she were to win while she was sitting, it would be buttoned up. And she got so nervous about buttoning it wrong that she just didn't. And the whole time she's walking up to go accept the award, the train is just flying everywhere. And I was just like, it's just the ultimate acceptance stress of an award. It was so... I love that dress. It was so special. But yeah, Raph and Mrs. Prada. And then, I mean, Dries was one of my most favorite designers of all time, I think. And to go out the way that he did is just so perfect. It's like nothing was ever too fussy. The shows were always perfect. My wedding invitation, I based it off of his fashion show invite. His show invites were incredible. Yeah, he's just... I mean, I guess I have like a... Where are they from? All from Belgium? Belgium. Yeah, Belgium. I love Matjou at Bottega. I think there's so many amazing, newer designers that have been in the industry for so long. Peter and Alaya. I just got another Alaya dress. Which, like, why am I buying dresses? I love that for you. I'll send you a link to it. It's so beautiful. I'm so excited that they're showing in New York. Me too. I can't wait. It was really smart of them to do that. And by the time this airs, we will have seen the show. Oh, yeah, well, I'm going with Greta, so you'll see her there. Oh, my God, I can't wait. Yes. I'll say hi to you guys. That's so fun. It's been so cool to see all these designers that you were aware of that were in all of these houses prior. And now have been given their own brands and seeing how all of them, I think what's so incredible about like a wrath and Matjou and Peter is that they worked as a team for so long and you see how different all of them are in these incredible and all amazing in different ways. And I just feel like, I feel like there's just like this influx of like design right now that makes me personally so excited. Yeah. But then there's also like Zane Lee, his friends called Lee and Greta wore his dress to the Independence Fert Awards. And I think he's doing something just so different and so special. Raul Lopez at Luar. I wore one of his gowns for an award show for the SAG Awards. I just think that it's a really exciting time for design. I think that there's a lot of different voices. And I feel like there's this kind of like world of like people really like honing in on like what they do. Yeah. And like this individuality that makes me really excited. I think you're right. And Lee and Luar obviously are both showing at Fashion Week, which is I didn't go last season to see Lee. So I'm excited to go look at it. I'm going to go too. Yeah. It's a really good point. And I think it's this thing of fashion got so big that you could no longer compete on that sort of $10 billion or more a year level. And so the people who wanted to keep doing it just started doing what they wanted to do and not coven everyone. And it's actually working. Exactly. And Alaya is the greatest example of that. I hope someday they release numbers because I am sure that that business has grown like a gazillion. It's like it just they have shoes and bags people buy, which isn't really important. And then they also have clothes like I never I would have never bought. And I obviously had deep respect for Alaya previously, but I would have never. Yeah. Yeah. It just felt like not. Not attainable. Yes. And now it's like it just feels like of this time. And I think you're right. And I think the story of the triumvirate of Matt to Peter and and Raph is just a really exciting storyline in our industry to follow. And it's fun because you will have like the one the interesting thing about red carpet is it's a part of history. So when these designers have like books and monographs or whatever made is that what they call them lithographs made about them. And the images of looks that you help put together and that we're on the red carpet. And that's really exciting. Like that's one of the things about what you do that's so fun is it used to be that fashion shoots were sort of the thing everybody referenced. But those don't really happen so much anymore. I know. And so what you do is going to be like a big reference point for creative people in the future and also just like establishing these actors in history and also these brands and these designers. And history. Not no pressure. That's a lot more. Probably. I think yeah that's a lot more credit than I don't think I deserve. But I am just so excited to be part of that conversation. And I get to be included in kind of the way that my client grows and the way that certain brands are being introduced. You know like with Lee Greta was the first actually never wear his work. And you know it was so natural where it was like we fit the night before the event after an award show. And I saw that she was like I'm going in the end of the word. I'm like I know what I think you should wear. It's a new designer. And that was we just sent that dress and she fit it that night and she wore it the next morning. And it's you know Greta is an extreme example of that because we work together for 10 years. But the truth is it's you know the way I work with every girl that I work with is really just being so intentional about what I'm presenting them. And I think that that is what allows me to work with the designers I work with because if I'm pulling something they know I'm pulling it to place it. Yeah. Like it's not going to be in a mix of racks and racks of clothes and that's not to say that that doesn't also work because I think that that's a great way to approach it too. Some people like to have choices. That's not something that I necessarily offer but I feel like I feel confident in that because of how well I feel like I know the girls that I work with. Yeah. How would you say thinking about it in that context. And there is this sense of like are they going to wear it. I always you know I always hear from designer PRs about like we made this dress and then they didn't wear it. And you know I would never ever do that ever. Do you think that that is just the evolution of the business and like because you started before it was a thing. And then you you saw it kind of change into a really big thing where there was this sort of bidding war for the for celebrities to wear stuff that and now there is a new phase of this industry where there are rising stars like you. And now you are very established but you're still so young and doing it for 10 years or whatever. But do you think that there is just a different way of working now generally and like how have how do you see the world of celebrity styling. How has it transformed in the time that you've been involved in it. I think that there's just like a great deal of people more people. There's just so many more stylists. There's so much more awareness of like the job that we do people like know who styles who when like celebrities go and work with other stylists. Like there's people are really aware of like the styling industry. You know there's like an Instagram like a checks a tag where it's like saying you know who's styling what client and what they're wearing. So it's just the idea that people have all this information that's first and foremost like makes everything so different. I also think there's a lot more people in the public eye now which is definitely you know very different than when I first started. Totally. I think that it's different because there's just more voices. You know I think that there's you know the I think of like the stylist that started when I was an assistant that are still styling now. I mean Leslie free Mars a great example of that. Yeah. I think that there is all different ways of how you kind of evolve in your career and I feel like she's quote unquote like in some ways like I think you've mentioned like retired. Yeah. But then at the same time she does take on specific work and I think you know working with Kamala it's like pretty impressive for her to like kind of drop back in and do something like that. Yeah. I think that and then there's other stylists that are in that same kind of era as her that are still like at it and have like multiple clients and are you know running around going all the award shows and all those things. I think it's really just what like feels right for each person but I think that there's a great deal of like access in terms of like the worlds that exists on the red carpet now there's like people that are famous on like Tiktok and YouTube and Instagram that I wouldn't know about. You know but there's a whole younger generation of stylists that are doing things like that and. You know are working with designers that I'm not aware of you know that are coming up also on like the Internet. Yeah. The world is so. It's just so much bigger. Yes. Even though it's smaller. Yes. Yeah it's so individualized that there are these people who we don't know who are have you know five millions and millions of followers you know or like whatever it is and they're they're on the carpet at a level. Or they're going to like the Olympics or things like that and I'm just I think it's just really important to kind of. Stay in your lane and do what you do and I think it's welcome though in terms of just having I just think it's really nice to have a lot of different perspectives this fashion is so. Like everybody gets to have an opinion and yeah and everybody gets to express themselves in their own way not only through their work but like in their daily life. And that's something I think that doesn't really exist in a lot of other art forms. You know people pick what they choose every day and they're like this is like my favorite actress and this and this is my favorite stylist like things like that like people have those opinions now. Whereas when I was starting a stylist or something that was essentially like a hidden job. Yeah. Yeah and it's an expression of you who you are as a human being that like you show to everyone. Exactly. It's like all these people are personal chefs. Why would someone help them get dressed like it's just a if you have the ability also people do this every day with their friends like they text their friends what should I wear. Exactly I think that the thing for me was growing up which is like you know being a teenager and it's just like as a girl it's just like a nightmare. And true you know in a lot of ways. I found my confidence in my strength in the way that I dressed. It was the one thing in my life when I was growing up that I was just so sure about like I knew what I like and when I would get something I like that I wore to school. The mean girl at school would be like you know want to see something mean but she'd be like I like your shirt. Totally. And that was like what it became like the secret superpower. Yeah. And that's essentially what I'm trying to give the girls that I work with. I just want to give them like armor on the red carpet. I want them to feel like that is something that they don't need to think about and they know it looks amazing. Yeah. And that that way they can take on all the other insane things that they're having to like kind of take in on a red carpet whether it's like a screaming photographer or an insane question on the red carpet. You know it's like I'm just trying to give the girls that I work with the armor for them to just feel completely safe in the way that they look. Outwardly. Totally. I know that they're kind of giving off that expression and I know that that maybe sounds like a great responsibility. But I also feel like it's something that comes naturally to me when I'm working with the right women. We're leading into Emmy's weekend. She is. Final question. Is there any hints or anything that we should expect to see from your team? From my team, between me and Caroline. Well I mean the people you're dressing who are also your team. I think that it was a very kind of exciting opportunity to have them both going to Emmy's because of the passion they both had. Yeah. You know and making sure that this was a fresh start. You know like it's a new year. It's a new awards run like this is. It's interesting because they both kind of expressed a similar vibe. So it's they're both you know wearing things that are completely different from completely different designers. But both of them have very exciting looks. I can't wait. You know and they're both really different. Both of them are wearing things that they've never worn before like in terms of just design. I'm excited. Danielle thank you for being here. Thank you for having me. I'm a big fan of yours because we have similar tastes but also you're I really like the way you approach things. I appreciate that. I hate this word but it's very holistic. I think it's important. I mean these jobs are not easy and they require a lot of you and they also require it's not easy to make money and to have a real business. And the only way you can do it is if you like think about it in this more. I think the thing that you said for me the biggest takeaway is this idea of like you can't work with people who are not right just because it's like a big paycheck or they're cool or they're really famous. You just can't. No it's a disservice to both of you. Yeah. You know it's a disservice to the client. It's a disservice to me. I think what makes beautiful fashion moments is when on the red carpet is when a stylist and an actress are really truly connected and you see it. Yeah. You know like you really and it transcends like look at someone like you know Dara and Hunter like you feel it. Totally. It's like you know that they're just like in tune and like those and that's what's exciting I think about styling right now too is like there's a lot of intention with some of the like the newer stylists in that way. And that makes me so excited because like it just makes for these really beautiful moments. I agree. I agree. Well congratulations. Thank you. And I look forward to seeing I'm excited you're also working with Salon's you every time you bring someone new in I get excited and you're doing great work. I'm so excited to get to work with her. Again another person who has incredible personal style. Oh my God. And you're just upping that. I'm just happy to be there. Happy to be there. I'm happy that you're here. Happy to be here too. Thank you again. It was so fun and I can't wait to see you at Alaya. I know it's going to be and you'll get to me Greta. You can tell her you know her friend Kevin from college. I will.
