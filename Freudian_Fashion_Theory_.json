And today with me on the show is Bella Freud, fashion designer and host of one of my favorite podcasts, Fashion Neurosis. Happy Friday, everyone. I am in New York for a split second. Yes, it's cold. It's not as bad as I had anticipated, but let's see how I'm feeling when I fly back to Los Angeles on Sunday morning where it's also in the 50s. So you know, what's 30 degrees anyway? New York is the best, but it's also the most ridiculous. I went down to the dry cleaner by my hotel to get a pair of pants pressed and the person at the front was like, we don't press anything. And if we did, it would take a week because everything we do goes to New Jersey and everything takes a week. I don't understand how that business works. You got to have quicker turnaround in the city, 24 hours, 48 hours. I'm willing to pay extra. Most people are best of luck to them operating that way. Luckily for me, because this is New York, I walked one more block and found a place that had 24 hour turnaround. This week on line sheet, we are busy on Thursday. Rachel Sturgat's dug into the business of Kardashian beauty. Does she even know Kim Kardashian had a beauty line? Well, she does. She's had many and Rachel has the numbers on this one's performance. She also checks in on Kylie Cosmetics, which has been a journey and those results may surprise you. I wrote about the potential exit of Valley designer Simone Bellotti, which, you know, it sounds like he's moving on to greener pastures, but these pastures were pretty green, at least for us who love the line and happy to have them around for the March show. Sad to see him go. Excited to see what happens next. Sarah Shapiro did a very sharp business analysis of Viori, where she said, if LinkedIn was a fashion brand, it would be Viori. Yes. I just want to say for all the people sending me feedback, I know Viori is popular. I understand why it's popular, especially among a certain set of people who really prize comfort above all else. I get it. What Sarah and I'd say by extension me are trying to figure out is how popular can it get. So they've raised over a billion dollars in funding and they have a valuation right now of $5.5 billion. That is definitely possible to achieve, but it's not easy. They don't have footwear like Nike. They don't have a real point of view. They have become, they're almost, I'd say you might want to compare them to Gap rather than another sports brand. They're almost the basics of this generation, but sans flair. The fashion statement is that there is no flat. Anyway, let's get going with the one and only Bella. I love her podcast.

It was lovely to be here. What did you have for breakfast this morning? I have the same thing for breakfast every day, which I look forward to the same amount of pleasure. I have black coffee with a piece of gluten-free toast and marmalade. I love that breakfast more than anything. That sounds perfect. Are you celiac or do you just prefer gluten-free? I just prefer it. It suits me. My husband is celiac, so we have a lot of gluten-free. We've been on a long gluten-free journey. It's the same here. It's not as bad as it used to be. It used to be like eating dust, but now it's more tasty. I wanted to have you on the podcast because I've been listening to your podcast and blown away. I love it so much. I don't listen to any other podcasts about fashion because it feels like homework for me. I just am totally in love with it and I want to get into it. I thought it would be interesting to hear. A lot of people who listen to this are going to be big Belafroid fans, but there will be people who don't know a ton about you. I wanted to explain how you became a fashion person. I thought we could start with your life and where I think you grew up in London. Where did you grow up? How did you end up becoming a fashion designer? I became a fashion designer. I went to fashion school in Rome when I was in my early 20s. I didn't learn a lot there, but I used to go and visit tailors and shoemakers. There was a lot of artisans still from the old days in Rome. I used to just hang around and see what distinguished ready to wear from made to measure and all the secret code of how garment is constructed, how shoe is constructed, and all the snobbisms of the making of something. When you have a cuff button that opens and what that means and why it's special and lots of things to do with interlining, which is very boring for non-fashion people. When you're making things, how you can enhance the way something's made and how it lasts well and how you can make things look particularly distinguished. It's all to do with the shoulder pad and the canvass and how the internals work. I suppose that's made me interested in the whole subject of fashion, the internals of everything and how people have a fantasy and an idea about what they want people to wear and how they get into people's souls, really, to love what the offering is. I learned a lot about that and all about the manufacture of things. After that, I went back to London and I worked for Vivienne Westwood and I learned really a lot from her and how things worked, really, in terms of making something and having a show and then selling it and the production. That was in the late 80s. What made you going back to Rome? What made you choose Rome versus going to ... I don't know if St. Martin's was ... I know in the 90s became the fashion school, but why did you choose school in Rome in particular? Because there are so many different avenues you could have gone down. I chose Rome because I was in love with someone who lived in Rome. I moved there and I went to the school there. That was the real reason. Do you think that that and the internals and the construction, I can see that in your work? To me, there's also something in your work that even though it's not flashy, there's an opulence to it, like a subtle opulence. Do you think that that was influenced by that time there or was that your natural aesthetic or way of expressing things? Yeah, it was influenced by that. I think I saw that when things were really well made that people seemed to shine more within it, that it gave them a kind of extra like a fairy dust almost, that something's ... I like the idea that you can wear a suit and that we can be like a 19th century poet and you can sleep along the side of the road on your journey to somewhere and you'll get up and dust it off and you'll still have a good edit. If something's made well and the fabric is good, you can kind of wear it until it falls to bits and it still has that elegance. Yeah, it's a really great way to put it. What was it like working at with Vivian Westwood? What you just said sort of flows into her work as well. Yeah, I was wonderful working for her because when I was a teenager, I worked in her shop seditionaries and there was nothing like it anywhere in the world and I'd left school and I went and worked as a Saturday girl and I just realized these clothes had so much power and influence and if you were wearing them, it bestowed some of that on you and I was the first time I really saw how important clothes were. If you didn't have much confidence like young people sort of struggling with their own sort of evolving of identity and clothes could really give you this magic kind of garb of something that you didn't actually have within you and then you could live in and find out how to act in the world. That shop, when you were there, did it feel like the center of the world? Yeah, it really did. I mean, it was really intimidating to come into. It had these grills on the front and I even remember one day sitting in there and seeing Debbie Harry walk past and look in and like I knew that she was thinking, oh God, I want to go in and I can't. I mean, I'm inventing that of course, but it took a certain courage to walk into the shop. But once you were in, it was amazing. It's funny. Do you feel like it used to be more intimidating to walk into shops than it is now? Or do you think? Yeah. Why do you think that is? I think there wasn't this feeling of trying to sell things like there is now. There is so much need for people to buy what you have and you have to do so much to woo your customer. Whereas in those days, there were these few places that people could go to and if you had the courage to go through the door, especially if you didn't have much money, you would have to face down the snooty stairs of the staff who looked you up and down and thought that person doesn't have any money to spend. Yeah. You needed a kind of certain amount of confidence to face it out. Yeah, I also wonder and this is maybe more of an American thing, but the way people dress day to day now where they all wear leggings and running gear into a fancy store with no problem and also that like you said, it's become more about selling. So it used to be that you'd walk in and maybe no one would say anything to you and now everybody is like on you immediately and smiling and friendly and you don't want to have that like pretty woman experience. Retailers don't want consumers to have the pretty woman experience where no one will help you, but it has, I mean, it's just how like so much retail theater is gone now. It's not as much of an experience to go into most stores as it used to be. It was so thrilling. I know it really was and people would leave you alone a little bit more to kind of get familiar with what started to call to you in the shop and you don't really get that chance so much now and sometimes it just makes you want to rush out because everyone's being overconciliatory and trying to interest you in something. Yeah. How did you end up working there? Did you just were you friends with people who worked there? Were you kind of in that scene? How did you land the sad because I'm sure the Saturday the Saturday slot was coveted because that's when the most people go in. Yeah, I was friends with people who worked there and I was the youngest sort of in the scene and then I remember when I managed to get the job and I was in this club in and Vivian was there and I had recently cut my hair, which had been really long and I cut it into a crop and she gave me this look and said, cut your hair. Okay, we know. And I thought, God, great. It's so exciting. And and that's how I started and I did that. I think I was 16 or something, 16 or 17. And then then after that, when I moved to Rome in my early twenties, when I was 22, Vivian had, she was working in Italy with one of those big manufacturers. Yeah. And we hooked up and she used to come stay with me in Rome. And I was at design school, feeling really embarrassed to sort of even pretend to be being a designer with with her. But she was very, she was, she'd been a teacher and she was very good at, I wouldn't say encouraging because she wasn't really that type of person. But I remember I was making something and she gave me some pointers. And I took that as a as an encouragement. What did you learn from her when you went back and started working with her? But either things she taught you or just like observing her? I mean, what I really learned was because everything she did was so unseen, no one had ever done the things that she was doing. So I learned to see an idea and have confidence that it would work. Whereas sometimes she, you know, be proposing something or describing what she wanted to do. And I think I can't really get this. I don't understand. But after a while, I, I started to wait for that moment when I would understand what she was doing. And my faith and belief in her was, it was a really exciting time to see be working on something that you just couldn't entirely envisage. And then when it came together, it was just this kind of magnificent sort of explosion of beauty, really. It was, and so she would ask me to go and find things and I'd go and look for staff and I got kind of into going beyond what I thought was right and just being more trying to be more adventurous and more imagining that this thing that maybe seemed to be nothing or hideous actually had something to it. And I was to remember, she said, I want to do a leopard print. Can you go and look for some and going down this market? And the only one I could find was really obby. And I just thought, OK, well, I'll take back a cutting. And I took it back to her. And she said, that's fantastic. And I thought, great, you know, I couldn't see that. And then she blew that up and it became a print and she used it in lots of things. And I've still got the shirt that she gave me from that show. And so I had this real, you know, trajectory of how it came into being. And it really took me to talk me to look further and see the possibility of them. Yeah.

Was it, was everyone, were all the different brands and the people, what worked at the different brands sort of mixing together? And, and it feels like it was an incredibly transformative time for the industry. And a lot of that was coming out of the brands that were based there. Yeah, it was very, I mean, the thing about England at that time was the manufacturing was so limited. And most of the factories were set up to work with high street brands and do repetitions and huge quantities. And so it was really hard to find people to work with who would develop things. Because, you know, people who started their own brands and their labels and it was more hand to mouth. And, but as a result, things were much more inventive. People had to literally make things themselves or the way things were constructed were not slick, not, you know, like in the 90s, we. Yeah, in the late 80s, she then had a manufacturer that backed her. And there was just the polish of how things were produced was so different. And they had all this experience and brought all this kind of Italian elegance to her, her kind of defying of what was on trend. And that, that was just gorgeous. We were so proud. I remember people in London, we, you know, there was this obsession with wearing these things and feeling so full of swagger and like you were the best person on earth. Because you had a Vivian Westwood jacket. That was really a big deal. It was really moving in those days. It was great. What made you decide to break out on your own? And when did you do that? Did you work for anyone else or did you did you go straight to do your own thing from there? Yeah, I went straight. I worked for Vivian for about three years. And then I, I just thought I'll try doing some, you know, I had, I thought I'd start doing accessories. So I made these little bags and some shoes. And then I bumped into a knitwear, this man who owned a knitwear factory in Scotland. He said, Oh, if you want to make some knitwear, come up. And so I drove to Scotland and worked with one of those factories where they were used to making v-neck sweaters for Marks and Spencer. And they just hated what I was doing. It was such a pain in the ass. You know, I remember the factory manager saying, my wife's arm would never fit in that sleeve. And thinking, well, it's not for her. This is for this caquette girl that I have in my head. But I learned a lot, you know, I learned how to get things done. And I think with fashion, there are so many obstacles at every single turn. It's difficult to make something. And you just have to go on and on and on and be obsessed. And for some reason, I had that obsession and I just went on and on and on until I got something I like. How have you stayed in it for so long? Because you don't the interesting thing. I think you mentioned this on the Jonathan Anderson interview, which I thought was, I mean, you're very good at pulling things out of people. And every person that you interview is so comfortable with you. And that helps, I think, a lot as well. But I think on his or another one, you mentioned that at some point you just stopped doing fashion shows. How have you been able to just keep moving forward? And and what have you done differently than maybe some of your peers or other people in the industry to be able to do that? Because you don't seem to be concerned with, as you just said about Vivienne Westwood, following trends or any of that, or business trends even. Yeah, it was partly just circumstances. I and I think my main thing was that I never stopped, even when I had there were times where I had no money at all. But I still made, I remember doing a collection. I've really just made one sweater. And then I bumped into this journalist friend of mine and she said, Oh, what are you working on? And I said, I said, I've done a new collection. It's just one piece. And it just came out. And I go, Yeah, OK. Instead of saying, Oh, I've done nothing. I've got one sweater. I in that moment, I decided that was a collection. And it took me through to the next stage. It was like crossing a river and there being an enormous gap between one stepping stone and the next. And I remember that that jumper was Ginsburg is God. And for some reason, I when I started my label, I made some short films. I just thought, Oh, I'll do this. I had no idea how to make films. I didn't know anything about it, but I did it. And I liked showing my work in a film because I felt like I could had more. I could mess about with the effect of it. And I did then do shows and things. And I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as some people. And then I decided to stop and started making some. I made three short films, though, with John Malkovich. I thought it would be so fun to have an idea and to collaborate through someone else's visual point of view of it and see what comes out. And so somebody introduced me to John Malkovich and said, he's really into fashion. And I went to Paris and met him. And first of all, he said, I just can't, you know, I don't have any time. And then we just carried on and on chatting. And then he suddenly said, OK, I'm going to do it. I've got one and a half days next month. Be ready. And I was. And we just had such a great time. And that's that was one of the phases. And I thought, I'm just going to do the things I feel in my strengths and the things I've always laughed at, knitwear and tailoring. So my idea of a collection is always about knitted, the soft center. And then the accessory is almost the tailored piece. And so I've just refined my love of suit and I love the boyish girl way of dressing. And I find that very feminine. And so I've I've just done that and I've never never given up. You mentioned the the factory in Scotland. How is observing because you are, you know, a big knitwear designer? I'm sure that you've seen like the trajectory of that industry. Do you still produce anything there? Feel like recently Scottish cashmere and also just knits generally have come back into the conversation quite a bit and also just. Knits being being made in that area of the world. Do you make anything there? And what has it been like as you as your business has changed? What has it been like to observe how those businesses have changed? And I'm sure some of them have gone away and. Or a lot of a lot of the factories shrunk or closed down. And then exactly as you described, this sort of shift happened. And then I think there were so many more designers. And then the high street became interested in design instead of copying people, they employed designers. So the whole quality of what they were producing was much better and more interesting. And then it was possible to start doing certain things with Scottish mills. And it depends on what kind of machinery they have. Like when people are very, you know, dismissive about things made in China, but there's a whole world of. Of hand, not handmade, but hand laid machines that they still have in China. And these people were really expert at, especially for my stuff, where I use a lot of words on my knits. And in Scotland, they don't have those machines. And if they do, it costs a fortune. Whereas in China. You have these really skilled people. And a lot of it's also to do with like building relationships. And I met this agent to, they were just so helpful and facilitating. You know, how to make something and how to make it feel good and finish. And a lot to do with those friendships with certain people that I work with there. And they, you start to know each other and they know what you like. And you ask if you can try this. And, you know, it's like working when I first started working in Italy, how there was this eagerness and this interest in, in producing something that was difficult and how to figure that out. And that's beginning to revive in the UK now. Where there's the kind of this meeting of wanting to help each other. Instead of everyone used to be, if you say you were a designer, someone's fate, they'd be like, oh, God, designers are a nightmare. Because we always want it to be better or different. Or can you do this or make it like that? And that's improved a lot here. The kind of, I think people, the manufacturing industry, can see more what's that there's a real good relationship to be had with designers and how we can all benefit from a little more flexibility. What is the most popular jumper you've ever done? Is it the 1971 or? Yeah, it's that still. Why do you think that's been? So it feels eternal now. It's funny, I think there's something about it that it suits a lot of people. And it's, even if someone doesn't really think about that, I mean, the date is just something. It was a random thing. It was just the date in the corner of a catalogue that I was looking through. And then even for people who were born, you know, in 2000s or whatever, it has an association that they don't necessarily know what it is, but it feels like it relates to something. And I think it, for me, I feel like it, I get a lot of ideas from like record sleeves and album covers and t-shirts and protests, posters and things people carry in a protest or that they wear on a march so that they're very instant. And I think it has something about that too. And the white stripe, it it's flattering to the face. And and I've also been quite, I mean, I do variations and I do use it on various things, but not on everything. I feel quite protective of it. So first of all, I only did a black jumper and I really didn't ever want to do anything more than a black jumper with this white stripe. And my sales agent said, please, can we can we just have one color that is how many black jumpers can someone buy? And I thought, OK, I understand it. But each time I do a different color or a different type of yarn, it feels very thoughtful. I'm very careful. And I hope that that runs through. And even though I have a selection, it's not everywhere. It's still a precious thing. And it feels very collectible. And and I'm sure there are people who have every single one or or they have this this edition or that edition. And it definitely feels special. I mean, all all of your work does. I love the jumper you're wearing right now. It's really great. It's it's green and black stripe with like a little mock neck. It's really good. Oh, yeah, I've got another sweatshirt. Oh, you do? Oh, yeah, it looks like. This is a mohair sweat as I I love mohair. Well, that's a sort of throwback from the punk days when people laugh. Mohair reminds me of cooking. Yeah. Each spring, twenty three Pulitzer prizes are rewarded for distinguished journalism, books, drama and music. There was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll, and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out it was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are and columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th.

So tell me about the podcast and why you decided to do it and the concept because you have a very famous last name and you're interviewing people as if you're in a therapy session and the person's lying on the couch, which I love. I wonder if it changes the way they speak because they're lying back the way of the microphone pointed towards them. But tell me about it. Well, I thought I'd been thinking for years about how to write about what happens in the fashion world and all the things that happen backstage and behind the scenes and the getting an idea to be its own thing and to exist in a garment and there's so much fun in there and people are so funny and there's all these kind of shortcuts and codes and the language and all this intimacy. And I wanted to find a way to describe it somehow. And then I'd always wanted to, I started off thinking that I wanted to do a chat show, but I wanted it to be almost like I'd seen these videos of Alec Gensburg at the Albert Wall in the 60s. And there was just this granular feeling about it that made you want to know more, to be able to hear with the bad sound and just to find out what are they talking about. And also some of the poems you just think, I don't know, is that really deep and meaningful or is it rubbish? And there is an aspect of fashion, which is a bit like that. But in the end, the clothes themselves have to be, you know, totally convincing. And with the couch, I was thinking, when I was first sort of messing about doing little setups and stuff, I thought, OK, if someone lies on the couch and I'm in the chair, people will recognize it, hoping that fashion neurosis maybe would take off and I could like travel around the world interviewing people. So I thought, OK, this is my prop. And obviously it's a kind of tongue-in-cheek play on the sort of situation of lying on the couch with a psychoanalyst. And do you want to briefly explain your background so I don't have to do an expository at the top, like who your family is and why the analyst couch makes so much sense? Well, yeah, my great-grandfather was Sigmund Freud. And then my father, who was the person I was looking to for all my kind of influence, he was a painter, a Boozian Freud. And he never really talked about Sigmund Freud at all. And once I asked him about him and he said he was very funny. So I thought, great, you know, I like the idea of that. And I have to confess, I haven't actually read. I've read half of Interpretation of Dreams. And then the things I've read about him have. I read a comic book, a graphic novel, and that was great. And I've sort of got the measure. And I also thought someone's going to do this. So I'll do it. And and then I find that something does seem to happen when people lie on the couch. People do seem open to just talking. And and I also wanted to have this overhead camera. So it felt like you're looking into their thought process. And the fact that when someone's lying down and they're looking up, they're not looking at me. So there's not they're not trying to figure out what I'm going to say or whether the conversation's over. It was something Jonathan Anderson said to me. He said, it's interesting because I'm because I can't see your eyes or your lips. I can't I can't do the thing that normally happens in the conversation where where you stop or you you just wait for the other person. And and I find I'm listening carefully and to when I say something or maybe I might interrupt someone occasionally. But some mysterious thing seems to to happen that makes for a very kind of close conversation. And I find I say things as well that I didn't necessarily anticipate, I'd say. But because, you know, I have questions that I prepare. But I also like to see where we can go within those questions. And sometimes I don't ask all the questions or they'll start saying something that I was already going to ask them about. And we go on a bit of a tangent and it's exciting. What has guided who you end up having on? Because you've had a lot of designers on. And I haven't listened to the Rick Owens one yet. I've listened to Zadie Smith, Jonathan, Kristen Scott Thomas, which was truly amazing. And I love listening to you to talk about film and and fashion inspiration and cinema and also how she works with the costume designers and all of that. But it's a mix of people. It seems like a lot of people that you have relationships with. But you have had quite a few designers. They seem very open because you're a peer. But what what is driving the people that you're choosing to to bring on? Well, I want to have a real variety. I want I want there to be a shape in the podcast that is a kind of unexpectedness of someone you may not imagine you'd find interesting. But everyone I. Asked to be, you know, to to come on the show is someone I feel that I could have an interesting conversation with that. I don't necessarily know what it's going to how it's going to be like that. But it's a real gut feeling and a feeling in my heart of. I'm fascinated by this person. And I feel that there is something that could take place if we. Could have. We could talk and there are things we might share in common or. Maybe not like when I was talking to the writer, Carl, of a Knaz garden. I just so moved and compelled by his writing and also, you know, when his books came out and there was this picture of this amazing man so handsome and this is always quite exciting for us in the fashion business when someone's incredibly brilliant artistically and they look amazing. So that's really fun. I have I have really enjoyed the fact that you talk a lot about whether or not people are good looking. In the I know I love it. You're you're always asking what people find attractive what they don't. And it's something that I think now people really stay away from that. Like observing beauty or attractiveness because there's so much people are just nervous to say anything about someone's physicality. But like we're human beings and there are people you find attractive and there I don't know I really I really enjoyed that part of it because I talk about it all the time. I agree. Well, it's the thing is it's so it's all these strands within you that. A bond with other people and it's not just whether they're pretty. It's so much more than that. But it is about being attracted to people for all sorts of reasons. And that's such an interesting thing. And it's so thrilling when you get on with someone and there are all these factors. And I think people in fashion. We understand that on a deeper level that it's not about someone being you know, like whatever, you know, just like classically good looking. It's we really love the inner beauty and we want to dress that and that how that shows up in somebody is fascinating. And it's not about perfection. It's the it's not at all about that. It's not at all about that. Because I think designers in particular were so aware of where sort of like so conscious of our own imperfections. And we like Jonathan talked about that and Rick Owens is so he's just the way he talks about his own body is just so it's just so moving. And you know, when you are kind of growing up and you have all these concerns about yourself, I mean, that that's never going away. And how you can use clothes and friendship as well as part of the how you make yourself feel safe and confident. And but if you don't want to be anonymous, how do you how do you attract attention to yourself when you're an introvert? You still want people to know you and notice that you have something to give. So it's all that kind of stuff, which and it's been a little bit reduced into, you know, it's like somehow it's not respectful to say something nice about how you are affected by someone. And I think there are trends for that stuff. And and it also is an alert to how to be respectful to people and still validate them. But interesting, I do think that there is a movement towards accepting that people are very complex and that not everything's binary. It's no one is all good or all bad. And you could say it's like woke, anti woke, whatever. Now it's sort of there. Everyone lives in the gray area. And and there are more people sort of digging into that. And it feels like, I mean, what you do as a designer, you can see complexity in what you do, even if it's a simple jacket or sweater. And that that idea we were talking about the what's underneath. And that's what makes it feel worth it. Worthy. My final question for you would be when you look at the fashion industry and observe it, you obviously are very. It's interesting, Isaac Mizrahi just did an interview with on the Harper's Mizar podcast about shopping, but he mentioned Jonathan and he said he didn't even know his name. He said that designer from Loewe, I just I love him. But it was interesting because I feel like I think Jonathan in his generation is is singular and it's so fun to write about him and cover all the businesses that he has created. But as someone who you've been in the industry, you you but you clearly are aware of what else is going on. What do you think? Fashion is right now. There's so many brands that have become like extremely generic and don't have that that I'm like rubbing my fingers together, that extra layer of integrity that you that you have as a designer. Do you think that the industry is moving back to that? Or do you think it's always going to be this mix of like hypercommerciality and then people who are trying to push things forward and bring ideas to it? I mean, I think it'll always be like that. But there seems to be more openness to ideas that young really young people are craving ideas. They don't just want a look. They want. They want things within that they want. They want to read. They want to understand older people. They want. They don't seem. I mean, there's always trends for this stuff. But I suppose in the 80s, when people in fashion, it was a tiny group of people and people were mocked, you know, people. Everyone was very derisory about fashion people. Either they were very rich and, you know, you never really saw them on the street, but you'd see these people who are dressing up in this amazing way. And. And there was a much less acceptance of them. And that kind of. It was hard one. And so that generation and now the older generation. And when we look at young people like. Wearing all all sorts of different things or wild stuff, it's. Or even like really old people just dressing up to the nines. I when I see people out and about, we've made an effort. I just think. Great, you know, it's so lovely. It's so beautiful to see. And it's really tender. And I think. I think it's a way of like. I think now things are seem very bleak in the world. And it's a time when. Kind of clothing and ideas and music and. Everything that gives you the next thought is. Very, very sort of essential and it feels. Almost like desperately important. And that is an interesting time. Bella, thank you for being here. Thank you so much. When does the. When does season two of the podcast launch? So season two launches in the middle of January. So by the time you all listen to this.
