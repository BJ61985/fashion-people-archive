Happy Friday, everyone. I am in Los Angeles for a few more days than I had to New York next week. I'm getting very excited, but also I would like to enjoy this weekend. I'm going to go to the beach. Big moment for me. I don't do the beach, but I'm going to do it. I'm going to sacrifice myself for my family this weekend. Hopefully the sand won't be too annoying. Anyway, this week online, she was pretty wild. Rachel Sturgats had this crazy story about how a Givenchy setting powder has essentially like the changing of a formula of a setting powder has upended the entire business. And it do cares about who's going to be the designer of Givenchy. That's not the story this week. The story is about the setting powder. I implore you to read it. On Thursday, I had a fun scoop about how far launching leather handbags. I think we'll learn a lot more about this soon, but it's going to be a big deal. And I'm excited to see what people have to say about it. The discourse around it, how far's bags are really affordable because they're made of synthetic materials and these are going to have to be more expensive. They're using like really fancy leather. So excited to learn more. I also dug into the recruitment process for the new designer Chanel. It sounds like they're getting far into it. The current front runner seems to be Simon Porte, Jacomus or Simone, as some people would call him, but I'm American, so I'll just call him Simon. And it seems like he's the front runner as of now. I would say it sounds like from my sources that he's gotten pretty far in the process, but that doesn't mean anything. It could still turn out another way. These things are very fluid and I think you see that as Givenchy. They've been interviewing people probably for years for this job, even before when they still had a designer. And sometimes you're just interviewing people to see who else is around and what could change. And in this case, they don't need to rush. I think they feel like they need to put someone in there and they want to because of how the business works, but they're going to take their time. They're going to pick the person they think is right. And they really want this to be a long-term job, which I don't know. That seems like a little bit wishful thinking, but if you want to have someone around for 10, 20 years, you have to try to pick the right person. And so who knows, but best of luck to everyone who's interviewing. I hope you're enjoying the process of interviewing for the biggest fashion job in the world. I still want Eddie to get it, but that's just me or Mark Jacobs. You know, anyone, honestly, all these people, I like them all. Next week is going to be pretty crazy with work and I'll be around. I'm going to as much stuff as I can. I'm an inbox zero person and have not responded to a lot of emails this week. I will be trying to respond to them this weekend in preparation. There's too much stuff. There always is. I'm excited to see many of you and let's get started with Brett. I've known Brett for a long time. She grew up in Brentwood with another Lauren Sherman who is not me. There are a lot of us. And I feel like the first time we met, that was our interaction. She was like, are you from Brentwood, Los Angeles? I was like, no, I'm definitely from Pittsburgh, not Brentwood. She's just hilarious. I love her. Business is really interesting. And I would say this interview is about sort of the business of cannabis and how she got into it and why she got into it as an accessories designer. It's not as crazy as you think, but there's a lot of sort of technical stuff in here. I've been really obsessed with this market because it is and it is in many ways being developed as a luxury product. And so I did a big piece years ago about what could happen with cannabis if it's nationalized. Are these brands going to become parts of like beverage companies like Diageo? Are they going to buy up a bunch of weed brands? Is LVMH going to buy a cannabis brand? I guess weed is not the cool word for it. But anyway, it's a really interesting conversation. It gets a little silly, but I think you'll have fun. It's great weekend, long weekend hang. And if you're in Europe and you don't have Monday off, please don't bother me. But if you do, you know, it's fine. I don't care. You can text me, you can WhatsApp me. And thanks everyone. Bye. Brett Heyman, welcome to Fashion People. Thank you for having me. First question. What did you have for breakfast? I'm currently having breakfast. It's off to the side. I'm very into. I like skipped the sourdough phase of the pandemic, but this summer I'm very into cottage cheese breads and banana buckwheat bread. So at the moment I'm having a high protein banana bread. So the cottage cheese bread, you mean the ones like on TikTok where they're like, I just made this puffy, beautiful bread out of cottage cheese. I mean, the really puffy ones I'm finding are from Greek yogurt. But yes, they're more dense and they've got lots of seeds. Yes, it's like apparently, I don't know why we've been sleeping on this, cottage cheese can make anything. Puffy bread, flat bread, just delicious. I need to get into that. I'm a huge cottage cheese fan. Like 80s cottage cheese? Yes. Like I've been eating cottage cheese with on rice cake since I was five. Like with a tab, obviously. Yeah, exactly. The interesting thing about it, I was thinking about this the other day and I'm sure there's been like 55 articles on this, but I have not read them. It's that it's such a big part of diet culture cottage cheese, but the thing is, and I associate it with like not only just drinking it with a tab, but also with like exercise culture and 80s aerobics culture. And like I was thinking about when I was little, I had this, did you have this? You probably didn't, but it was like called get in shape girl. It's actually very messed up. My mom used to do Jane Fonda and it was like little weights and little like sweat bands and there was like a little workout thing. And I thought it was so great. I mean, it is so screwed up. I mean, said that I feel like Jane Fonda really had it right. I mean, I don't know what was going on behind the scenes, but those workouts are spot on. You know what? I've seen her at the Silver Lake Farmers Market protesting and stuff like that. Like she looks amazing. Incredible. She looks healthy. Super healthy. I've read her biography. Like I know she's had issues or whatever, but generally I think she, you're right. She had a good attitude. It was like take care of yourself basically. Yeah. Let's move. Yes, agreed. The other thing I was told to ask you is what also ask which vape she is smoking. Who told you to ask me that? I can't reveal my sources. Well, I'm not currently smoking one because I thought I would try to be sharp, but I have one next to me for when we're done. For I like my favorite vape that we have is our watermelon flavored one and that's our hybrid. So that's my favorite vape. I have a different favorite flavor joint of ours or a snack, I should say. So we're talking about marijuana or cannabis or whatever. I don't know. So tell me what do you do, Brett? Why are we talking about weed, which has never come up on fashion people? I know it's the first. Well because we have, I have I should say a brand called Edie Parker, which sits at the intersection of fashion and flour. So half of your book, but the other half certainly a little bit different. And how did you end up here where you, and what does that mean the intersection of fashion and flour? What is the other, what's the fashion part? So in 2000 and God, let me just think of the time. 2010, I launched a company called Edie Parker. Edie Parker is my daughter's name. I launched the company, you know, a few months after I had her and I found naming a baby very trying. So the idea of naming something else that year was too hard for me. So I just use that name twice. And basically we started as a line of acrylic clutches. I had worked in PR previously. I'd covered handbags for a lot of my career and felt like nobody was focusing on evening as a category. I had collected my whole life, these vintage acrylic clutches, and really felt like there was opportunity to reintroduce them because there was so much excitement anytime I wore them and so many questions and nostalgia. So we launched this company because of my fashion background, we were able to really grow in that niche. We were sort of on every red carpet ever from that period. So we're due to every award show, every movie premiere, and continue to grow at a monster line of home accessories, mostly in that core acrylic product. And the whole ethos of that brand was like surprise and delight, make things that are really kind of colorful and bright, and they really resonated. And so as we thought about expanding into other categories, a traditional path perhaps would have been jewelry, shoes, maybe even ready to wear, but we felt that those were A categories, I started they had no talent, and B categories that were very saturated. And so this use of cannabis kept coming up as something that we in the office enjoyed. We were watching kind of the green waves in California and on the West Coast and just everything that was happening there and how dispensaries were starting to look so beautiful and cannabis was becoming more and more mainstream. And we thought it might be something we wanted to participate in. It's fascinating. We're going to like break down how exactly that happened. But let's talk a bit about the the handbags first, because I still think that that market is is under under saturated or under penetrated as as the analysts would say. But why why is that? Do you think it's just because everybody goes out at night, even if you don't go out like to gallows or red carpets or anywhere where you need to wear a ball gown, like you have to look cute and your your bags are the type of thing that I'm sure many people use during the day as well. Like they they're square. They're marbly. The resin looks there. And then you had cute sayings and and the aesthetic was so clear from the beginning and and really, really fun. But I still think that that market is it was like Judith Lieber and I was talking to Kate Young the other day, we were talking about this woman who became a Trump ambassador. She's from South Africa. She something Lana Marks. They was like the two of them. And when when you started, did you was it just like the pickup really fast because that market? Why do you think that market is so sort of spare? I think just because it's a it's a reliable category, but it is smaller. I mean, even Judith Lieber, it's never been a huge business and she's been the biggest in that category forever. So I just think, you know, there's not that many places you can go where you would devote your business to it. I think obviously most brands that sell handbags have a small clutch or a miniature version of a best selling bag that becomes an evening bag. But to focus really on minot dies or sort of mini bags, it's just it's less lucrative candidly. Where did you source the resin? This was very hard. I basically the bags that I had collected and part of what I loved about them was that they were all made in America post World War II. There was this really innovative period in America, obviously in America is not only setting big trends, but fashion trends globally. And the use of plastic is a big part of this. And so when I started, I really wanted to make bags in America. I can't even tell you like, even as I tell you the story, which I haven't told in so long, it was so naive of me having like, you know, a lot of years of fashion PR, but just making I could manufacture. I didn't even know what a product development job was. But I literally just used Google to look up every kind of plastic manufacturer in America and just called them or visited them or, you know, tried to work with them. And really almost nobody wanted to touch it because it's very labor intensive. I mean, the reason the bags were so expensive, we didn't start out to make expensive bags, but hand manufacturing in America is expensive. And we were making these little cutouts and these little inlays and and it was really just teaching this one factory that eventually took us on in Illinois how to remake these. So it took it took a minute. I have in my head Rhode Island. Maybe that's because a lot of jewelry is made there. But that's interesting that it was in Illinois. Wow. Illinois, yeah. And they didn't make any other handbags. They made like, you know, trophies and plastic pieces and tables like it just, you know, that was not there was no factory that was making those. Now granted, I could have probably found factories in China that were working in acrylic and it would have been much easier. But the quality just wasn't there. I mean, when copies started flooding the market, there was a visible difference. I mean, they looked different. They feel different and they're much lighter. So I could have done it probably easier and less expensively, but it just wasn't the point. So you mentioned being in fashion PR. Where did you work? And like, I don't know. I like this. It's like I just met. Yeah. Where did you work in like also? What did you learn from being a PR person that helped when you launched the brand? Well, I worked at Gucci and then I worked at Dolce and Gabbana and then I went back to Gucci. And gosh, I mean, they were like some heyday years. I mean, I started at Gucci when Tom was still there. Not that he and I were friends, but it was a very exciting time. And then I saw all the way through the three designers, you know, Alessandra Frida and John and then just Frida. I just was talking to someone. Last week who worked there because I've been writing about Peter Hawking's and someone mentioned the three of them. And I I mean, I don't I don't even I barely even remember that. But they were talking about the like what it was like when Tom left and the three of them together. And I don't even know if I knew John's John John Ray, right? Yeah, his name. But I remember Alessandra and that period. But that must have been really interesting to be somewhere where it's like this larger than life person than suddenly he's gone. And there are these three deputies that are trying to make take it over make it over. Yeah, well, it obviously didn't work. I mean, look, I was a PR assistant. I mean, like that was my first job out of college. So I can't say I was in the room where things were happening. But I remember, you know, I got a job at like the most exciting brand in the world. And then it was sort of a palpable sense of this is a bummer. And also, you know, from my brief time in the corporate environment with Domenico de Soleil, like that was very special. And you've really felt a certain way. And then there was a sea change. I mean, Mark Lee was great. But then after that, it just it was a very different place to work. Wow. Yeah, you had Domenico and Mark. Yes. That's amazing. Yeah. And then Patrizio at the end. Oh, wow. And that was. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Went through all of them. And Mark was great. Just it was just a very different place. But it was also, I mean, I really loved Gucci because it was very corporate, very smart people worked there. Even though I was in fashion PR, we cared so much about at the time we called it CSR, you know, corporate social responsibility. We were UNICEF's biggest giving partner and that felt really important. I mean, the things we worked on were really important. And so there's a frivolity around fashion, of course, but the brand just took its its everything else, you know, just took the give back very seriously. And like what kind of company we were and wanted to be. And then going to Dolce, which was amazing and so fun, but such a different energy and such a different place. Did you work there with Brooke? She might have been before or right after you. She's now the CMO of Miskino. Good for her. But also, yes, but also like has a agency out here that she does. She's like a red carpet person. That's her expertise. Maybe she did she work in LA? Yeah. Yeah, that sounds familiar. I worked there only for about a year and a half because then, you know, Siddhartha left Gucci and so then Charlotte, you know, I went back. Siddhartha Shukla, Charlotte Blackman. Yeah, this is a lineage. The interesting thing about I was just talking about this the other day with someone. Oh, with Paul Kovako, who I may cry. Oh, God, why? You have to listen to it and nothing. It was great. We just like really liked each other. I it was crazy. I can't believe I had never met him, but I had wanted to for years because I'm obsessed with the story of KCD and really I wish I could just write books. I don't actually wish that I would be miserable. I was so miserable writing my book, love to Chantal, but I just like need to Fernanda as my co-writer on the book. But I just for the I always like have to like preface for the listener because I'm like, they don't know all these people. But it's just not very fun to write a book, but I don't know if you've written one, but it's not it's not the most fun thing. But I there are so many. I have so many book ideas and KCD is one. And we just started talking about stuff in his life and started. But anyway, the thing I said to him is that in fashion, there are always these sort of you think about it in terms of designers and which studios they came out of. But really, it's that lineage thing happens. And I am friends with so many people who come from that Gucci lineage. Are you all connected to Catherine Ross also? Let the Siddhartha and Susan certainly were more than eight. Yes. So like that. But you, Mary Fontimia, like they're just all these Charlotte black men. Like everybody who came out of Gucci is a good person. Basically, that's nice. That's what's amazing to say. And obviously, Siddhartha is the like Anushka Anushka, who is that Armani was Siddhartha's intern at Celeron. Like it's just crazy. And so every like nice, smart person who works in comms is from that crew of people, which is interesting. I feel like you said something nice and so I should cry because now I feel pressured to cry, otherwise it's going to be unsuccessful. Please don't. Mary Fontimia's and I, by the way, this is so uninteresting to your listeners, but we were together at Gucci and we loved each other. And then she went with Sidd to Celeron, as you know. And this was like, I mean, I don't know if we didn't have cell phones, we must have, but we used to fax each other. I used to write her, I mean, drop pictures of what I ate for lunch without her and fax it to her at Celeron because we missed each other. And that was our, those were our smoke signals. Oh my God. I love it so much. I, it's funny. I, I now I know her very well, but when I didn't meet her until Siddhartha's, I don't know, 40th birthday or something. And I don't, maybe I wasn't living in LA yet, but now we live in LA and I like go swimming at her house, but she is the kind of person like the second I met her, she's like, love you. Totally, but she means it. She really does. She's such a good person and also like really good and scary at her job, which is the amazing mix. But when you started the brand did having PR experience because I was talking to your PR person, the wonderful Gabby cats. Shout out Gabby. Everyone should hire her. I was talking to someone yesterday about like which PR people to hire. And he was like, uh, the only person I can really recommend is Gabby because she does the, she, she works so hard and she's, she's great, but she was like, she's like, Brett is such a good communicator. She said, should I be on the call? And I was like, Gabby, I don't, I don't really allow that on these. She said, well, he, Brett is just, she's such a good communicator. I don't need, but, but do you think that that helped when you were launching to be able to like come out up with story angle angles and all of that stuff? Yeah. I mean, just one more, give Gabby some credit. She, you know, I've been in this, I've been doing my own thing now for, you know, 14 years and I'm all, I've always, always, always wanted to be in the New York times and Gabby got us this story in the New York times. And when I went out with Jessica that day, Gabby's like, I'll be with you. And I could be like, you don't have to come with me. Don't worry. You don't have to walk around with me. And she thought it was the weirdest, funniest thing, but she asked that we all had a great time. Yeah. Um, yeah. I think having the PR experience, um, and by the way, not such a great communicator. I mean, that's, that's not what it is. It just, I was trained in a such a different way. You know, I'm not a designer. Um, I never thought of myself as a designer. I thought I was good at spotting things and seeing holes. What I knew how to do from PR was spot trends. Like, you know, look at all the shows, make the mood board, see what stories were probably coming up. And this was a time when magazines matter. So I would be able, and because I had relationships with all the editors, I was able to call them and say, Hey, I saw, you know, Mrs. Prada put rainbows down the runway and this like Hawaii theme. We have a Hawaii theme collection just coincidentally with rainbows. Let me send you these to keep because I know you're going to do the story and then you can use them. And like, if I didn't do that, they never would have thought of me. Not because they weren't nice, but we weren't an advertiser. We were small brand. Um, so it was just that kind of thing all the time. And then knowing, you know, what making a calendar of a war is making a calendar of important careers and just reaching out to stylists and sending them closets and just always being there when someone was looking for something because no one was going to think of us without that. Yeah. That's a whole, obviously an entire other job. And the fact that you had that background to be able to switch that on so many young brands come to me and say, who should I hire for PR? What do I want? And really the, the, I'd say that right now, the ultimate goal is to get the New York time style section profile. There's really not as anything left that feels like it can move. I don't know if those pieces move product the way the like shopping pages of the Wall Street Journal do, but it's, they're the, oh, it's the only thing that like can bring the mix of awareness and commercial that is, is really left. Like, I know there are certain publicists that their whole goal, they're the way they work is like the only thing I can promise you is that I'm going to get you this profile. And it's hard to promise. Like I, when I was a freelancer and this is 10 years ago, I wrote a couple things for them and I stopped pitching them because it took so long for the pieces to run. Like it would just, and I mean, it's different. It's a different editing team now and everything operates, but they are so, probably so overwhelmed. I would just check in every day being like, or every week being like, is it going to run this week? And it would eventually run. And then I remember they liked it and edit that. It was just the craziest experience. And I was like, I'm just going to write for the Wall Street Journal because it's much easier, but, but like that is the, that's the thing that did you, when you got, when Jessica Testa, our, our wonderful friend and really incredible writer at, at the times and occasional fashion people, I think she's coming on and she'll, not the week that this is running, but she'll be on in August at some point when, when that piece broke, did you, like, what was the impact of that on your business? I can't even quantify it. We definitely had a little New York Times sales bum. But I think it was more just the legitimacy. And I think, you know, what you do with it after, I think if there's, you know, you want to raise capital, if there's, you know, you want to be thought of in a different way, I really think it's the only piece of press that matters. And I have friends that have been in a similar situation who have confirmed the same thing. I mean, I just think, and we've had, I don't want to be unappreciative. We've had so much great press over the years. I mean, we really have. And people have been so nice to us and we've gotten great stuff, but there is just something about the New York Times that just legitimizes a brand and, and sort of makes it true. What it's, what, you know, what it says makes it true. It's that convergence of mass audience and authority that no other outlet really has. Like to me right now, the stuff that works in media is that. And then having being specialized and really understanding your audience and everything in the middle, which is most things don't matter. It doesn't matter at all. It doesn't matter. I mean, I will say you talk about this all the time, obviously, but the lines, not the line, the, the, you know, the, the sub stack girls, they're the ones that move product. We move more product from that than the New York Times, but obviously different goals, but that's it. Substack, New York Times and, and line sheet. I mean, for, for ego, when I was on line sheet, I was more excited than the New York Times. So give you that just for ego. Thank you. Well, it's different. It's not like I'm not like, although I do occasionally, if I, if I talk about something that I have bought, it does click, it does click. We do not have an affiliate program set up yet. We will. You should. Um, but it's interesting because it is, it's that concentrated audience. Cause they're reading through the whole thing. And I did some like Victoria Beckham mascara and literally every 15 people were like, I bought it. I bought it. That type of thing. I think if I was doing that, every issue, 15 things, it wouldn't work as well. Whereas someone like Becky Malinsky, who is her expertise is in finding products that you wouldn't have thought of buying and, and you should. I just got a link. I'm on a text chain with her and Lee Andrew of this bag from the row and they're, that's on some resell site and they're deciding which one of them is going to buy it. Oh, I want to, it's like, what about me? Hello, and me, um, you sold me those ragged and bone leather pants. Oh, you bought that? Yeah. But I returned them. I turned out, I don't look good in leather pants, but I was so excited. You know, it's funny. Another person told me they bought the Pro Enzo ones and we're like, no, they're hilarious. I've worn them like twice. It's fine. I got them a friend of mine bought them through one of her discounts. So it wasn't like, I also got a little bit of a discount on them because of that. But, uh, and they're great. I love them. It's just, yeah, leather pants or leather pants. I know. They're leather pants.

How do you, I also know your husband, the lovely Greg Heyman, who is, I'm assuming going to be jealous that you're on this, on fashion people. No joke this morning. I was like, all right, I'm going to do this podcast. And he goes, should I text Lauren and tell her hi before you go? I was like, I think you don't have to. Sure. You just speak to her and someone he thinks you have the relationship and I'm infringing on it. He, it's really funny. I haven't talked to him in a long time, but I was just thinking about the last time I saw him, we went to lunch. This is probably, I had probably almost a year. It was the week that there was like really bad smoke. I'm totally outing him on this. I think it's so hilarious. Remember there was like crazy smoke in New York that like in June of last year of 2023, we had lunch and he was like, let's sit outside. And I said, yes. Like we went to some play because I had some, I went to some, some comp, some like charity thing on the Upper East Side. And I met him for lunch. And because he was one of the few people because he's not in the fashion industry. Also, I don't want to get into it here, but he knows what Puck is. Let's just say that. And he was like, oh, I love Puck. I listen to the podcast, blah, blah, blah. And so he's like, let's have lunch. And then it, like the sky was yellow. And we sat outside and some woman walked by who was friends with you all. It was wearing high sport pants, which I was very excited about. And this was still when you didn't see them in the wild so much. But it was just the most hilarious thing ever. I was thinking I need to text him and ask him why he wanted to sit outside when the smoke was so bad. And we like smoke like it would have been like smoking like 15 cigarettes our lunch. You know, he's asthmatic and never bothered by smoke. He was to hate any opportunity outside. He lived for three years in LA and like really romanticizes that time. And I think eating some side for him is like a throwback to that. And really, he'll do it any time. He loves to sit in the sun and eat lunch. I think nothing less enjoyable than being in the beating sun eating, but it can't can't get him inside. So funny. So Greg is connected to the cannabis business, right? He had like a holding company that had different cannabis brands. He had a fund and they did a lot of private investments. Yeah, Greg. Well, Greg is a big cannabis fan and started investing just personally around 2016. And and that's sort of how I got interested in the space because he would talk to me about it all the time. And and there were just all of these businesses popping up that, you know, we're really good at what they did. There were good growers or they had been illicit growers for all these years and they had been operating in the illicit markets. And then they had this opportunity to kind of come forth and and be sold in like, you know, a beautiful dispensary like men, men, but they really didn't know how to do anything else. So they didn't know what good packaging looked like. They didn't know how to market. They didn't know how to, you know, tell a brand story. And it's just, you know, as I visited dispensaries more and more, it just became like we felt like there was an opportunity for us and certainly a huge white space because nobody was talking to women, credibly. Like there were just no brands talking to women. And truly, I mean, look, I really grappled with this idea of we make thousand dollar evening bags for the most part. And like, how are we going to sell cannabis? And so the way that it seemed credible to me, at least in the beginning was we'll start with cannabis accessories. We'll make beautiful accessories that we treat like bar accessories because nobody does. You know, cannabis accessories are designed to be hidden in the back of a drawer. You know, they're from your NYU smoke shop, and they're just not thoughtful or elevated. And so we started working on just accessories that felt like accessories from the 70s. They felt like Edie Parker. They felt like they were meant to be displayed and shared and gifted. But it just it took a long time to develop them and develop them. And in that time, we really also felt like there was space for us in a dispensary with flower. And so that's, you know, I mean, that's a very long answer, I guess, to Greg's involvement. But he just got me really interested in the space. Yeah, no, I it's first of all, the name flower is brilliant and so obvious, but no one had ever used it, which is also interesting. I mean, and it just goes to your marketing prowess. First question on all of this is, do you know Verena von Fett? Of course. Let's know her at the spring. Gossamer, good friend of mine who has this magazine called Gossamer and she she was a magazine editor and writer for a long time. And I guess she was really an online editor like me. We weren't print magazine editor. She actually replaced me at Lucky Mess. Oh, no way. That's how we became friends. Yeah. Like, because I talked to her before she took the job. It was like, good, enjoy it. Crazy time. When she launched Gossamer, which is a magazine for people who smoke weed or for people who are interested in it, which is something like there are so many threads here. One is that kind of use of cannabis being a casual, everyday thing and not being this like illicit thing and kind of changing their narrative around that. And then also this narrative of like it's for women as well. And I think that that's still really lacking. There are so few brands like yours. When you launched, you mentioned Mad Men, which was like a big multi-brand and they actually had a ton of fashion industry people working there at one point. You know, people who had worked at Prada and Fat Lori Trott, who is a big fashion stylist was there doing marketing and Dina Sui. And it was there were a lot, a lot of people, people there. But Mad Men sort of imploded. I we go to I'm not a big smoker of marijuana. I just it's not it's not my thing. But I have other things. But but my husband, we let my husband enjoys it. It's legal in California. So it's OK for me to be using it. But we go to I think it's called Little Flower or something like that, which is a cute multi-brand. But when you got into it, like, who did you who did you? Greg, Greg knew the world. Who did you talk to on? Like, did you talk to people? Like, were there people like Verena who you kind of started talking to early on about all these other like narratives? Because when you starting something like this, it's not just like, I'm going to sell stuff, this is an actual like cultural impact that you're making in some ways. Yes. Well, it's a really small world. I mean, you mentioned Verena. Verena is like there's like two magazines, you know, Goth, Gossamer and Broccoli. You know, I mean, it's just there were two magazines that we reached out to. And I think everybody was, for the most part, pretty excited about what we were doing because it's not even that Verena and David like speak to women. It's just they're like elevating cannabis. You know, I think there's still part of the stigma around cannabis is that it's just like dirty, you know, fratty, just like these images that are very unsophisticated and that's not the case at all. And so I think this idea that like we had this kind of history as a fashion brand and we were in fancy magazines and we were in fancy stores and we really wanted to participate in cannabis. I think people welcomed that association. It was different than what existed. So I think we were able to kind of befriend the people in the industry pretty quickly. And yeah, so that's I mean, that's what we talked to. We went to dispensaries and plus we weren't starting from scratch. I mean, we launched Flower in 2019. So we had been in business, you know, almost nine years. And so we were able to use some of our mainstream media connections and we launched with a store on Madison Avenue. So we were able to get kind of mainstream press in a way that a lot of our peers and cannabis have been unable to do. I wrote a piece for Business of Fashion probably. Oh, God, I don't know. Everything now feels like six or seven years ago. It was definitely a couple of years before the pandemic. So I guess six years ago or something about like the opportunity in marijuana for luxury. So for me, to me, as a person who looks at this stuff, I think about beverage, alcohol, and the companies that own the big groups, including LVMH, but also like Anaheiser, Bush or whatever, the big groups that own all the alcohol brands are eventually going to start buying marijuana brands because in the first big one that I don't think exists anymore, that like the cool first cool weed brand I ever saw. Do people use the word weed? It feels very. No, you're good. OK, it feels like very set like I'm a 70s mom. I don't know what I'm talking about. No, no, you're good. So so the was this brand Bebo, which was Clement Kwan, who worked at like, I'm sure you know these people well. And what's that guy's got? Yeah, it's the Scott Campbell, the tattoo artist. So the two of them had this brand Bebo. And that was very early in that, I think is how I got this idea. But the idea was like, and they did end up selling it. And now it doesn't exist anymore, right? It does, but not in the same way. It does. OK. Not in the same way. So they did end up selling it. Congrats to. Oh, yes. Big congrats to them, by the way. They really got that tail end of the froth. Amazing. So at that time, there was like so much money going into this business. And what I wrote about was like, what's it going to take for one of these big groups and not just LVMH, obviously, that's the one we all think about in the fashion industry, because they own, you know, a lot of spirits, brands and and wine and all that to be comfortable getting into to it. And my whole thing was like, until it's legal across the country, that's not going to happen. But then doing a little more research and reporting about it, I learned more about how it's sold. And I don't know if this is still true. Wasn't it there was something you could only buy it with a bank account? You couldn't use a credit card to buy it. I don't know if that's it's still true. And it's and it's state by state, right? So like it's regulated by state, which means. If you want to sell it in one state, you have to have a license. If you want to sell it in another state, I don't know if license is the right word. But can you explain how did you all? Greg had background in it, and I'm sure you did too, because you all are life partners, so you're talking about this stuff all the time. I'm sure you're telling us our pillow talk. What stage do you think is going to be recognized? Go on. So what how did you all approach it? Did are you like, did you did you do New York and California? Did you do New York first? You said you launched your Madison Avenue store, which is I love this concept of these ladies walking in and grabbing their their pen. Totally. OK, it's a long answer. So feel free to zip me. You know, it's I can give you an involved answer as you want or a short announcer, but we have time. OK, great. So basically everything you said is true, but it's even worse than you say. It's basically, you know, cannabis is is a schedule one drug. And that's insane. It's, you know, just for context, heroin is also a schedule one drug. Cocaine and fentanyl are scheduled to. So this idea that what? Yes, yes, yes. So this idea that this like magical plant, which has been used ritualistically for thousands of years. So just one one thing on that. Does that mean like if you get caught? Like snorting cocaine at the Chateau Marmont in the bathroom, you will it compared with smoking weed and there was a cop in the bathroom who who caught you. You could get be in jail for longer. I mean, look, the schedule to is also bad. Like you would still probably in trouble, but it's the big joke about. And it's not sunny. I'm like, we're making it a sunny thing. But the war on drugs and the way that the black and brown communities have been harmed by this is exactly your sentence, which is men of color who maybe got caught for with two joints in their pocket, went to jail for 11 years. White bankers who had cocaine problems got working comp and workman's comp and like went to grocery rehab. So it's obviously it's a big problem in this country. But yes, I mean, it's just so insane and so politically motivated how the scheduling happened. Like kind of a should never have been scheduled one and the architects of this war on drugs admitted as such. Like the Nixon administration came out and said, we know we're lying about this, but we can't just prosecute anti war folks and black people for being hippies and black. So here's how we're doing it. Anyway, that was a stange. So yes, so because it's not federally legal and it's state by state, it means two things. One, you can't bank it. So that's why you can't use a credit card. And it's why you can't have a normal bank account if you're a cannabis business. So basically cannabis businesses which generate hundreds and millions of billions of dollars have to use credit unions. So it's basically like cannabis businesses and and people who don't have citizenship. And then and so for us as a brand, what we've done to mitigate the sort of like, you know, onerous restrictions and pricing, you know, the price that money would have to spend to have licenses in all these different states. We've basically licensed our IP out to different operators in different states. So they're the ones that will grow and pack it and distribute. And we do all the things that we do, which is design packaging, pick strains, do the marketing to the brand for the, you know, all that other stuff. But yeah, even like states that are contiguous, that are legal, you can't cross state lines. So it's just so silly. It's so insane. And I'm hopeful that it's changing because I'm not sure you're aware, but the Biden administration did director review of the scheduling and and Health and Human Services did recommend that it be rescheduled to schedule three. DOJ also recommended that, you know, like Health and Human Services directed the DOJ, DOJ made that recommendation to DEA. And now it's in, you know, it's in DEA's hands. But, you know, we don't know what's going to happen. Do you think it will ever be legalized nationally and how far out do you think? Because I remember, I guess, Trump was still president when I did the story. Yes. And I remember thinking like, I mean, this is too logical for anything that happens in our world. But like, this is an incredible business opportunity. It's just like, it's crazy to me how much money people could be making. And they're not. I it's just and I guess it is comes back to like, there are so many layers of this where they're getting other things out of it by keeping it legal. But like, what do you think the timeline of legalization is nationally? I mean, I really don't know. I think in cannabis, we've all been had so many false starts, you know, there's so many people that think, you know, especially things like passing safe banking as a first step, you know, I mean, you're right. So cannabis generated, I think about $40 billion in legal sales last year. So think about combining that with the illicit market. That's a double. And in the states where it has been legal, it's been a while now in these states, like the sky has not fallen there. And, you know, the tax revenue it is generating and the job creation is staggering. So at some point, it will just be, you know, when things make money, I agree with you. It's cynical, but like, it's just really hard to deny something that's, you know, really putting good out there for that long. Having said that, I think the opposition to cannabis from places like the alcohol lobby and other places like we have underestimated it time and time again. So I hope, I mean, if there is, if Kamala gets in the White House and there's, you know, I just, whatever the house in the Senate looks like, I believe that people want it. I believe that people really see the benefits and they want it. But if it's Republican across the board, then, you know, who knows what happens. And I'm, and the minimum, like you just hope that the Republicans don't call off the rescheduling because that could happen. And that would be terrible. Yeah. Isn't that guy Mitch McConnell? Like, isn't he into weed? Like he's into hemp, you know, his state's a big hemp day. And so he passed this farm bill in 2018, which basically made hemp legal. But like, you know, there's a, like it has to be 0.3 percent THC. He did something that was like completely self-serving for his state, obviously, because he's like brilliant politician. Do you remember when hemp was like sort of a fashion thing when we were like in high school? Totally. Type air. Yes. I was like very into the aesthetic of that whole situation. And hemp was like, you'd go to the two shops in Pittsburgh that sold like the head shops and they'd have like hemp pants and T-shirts made out of hemp. And it was going to be the thing. It should be the thing. I still wear hemp T-shirts. Young baby makes these amazing hemp T-shirts. Oh, yeah. And by the way, as a crop, it takes so much less water and so much less resources than cotton. So it really should be a thing. But I agree. There's again, a stigma. It's like a hippie smoke shop thing. So something else we have to work on. Shout out to Teleropa in Oakland, downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I used to go there at like seventh grade, spent all my birthday money at Teleropa on hemp stuff. So how you you launched this thing, you launched this new category in your handbag and home goods line that is fancy and super glam and has like this fun humor and retro tinge, all this stuff. And suddenly you're like, I also sell products to smoke and and ingest weed or marijuana or cannabis. And you also may I make it. I know you. So I knew the context and that makes sense to me. And I think a lot of people in the industry who know you, it made sense. But like, how is communicating that to the industry more broadly? Like, what was the reaction and also the consumer reaction? Pretty mixed, I think for the most part, I mean, I would say it was overwhelmingly more positive. I think we got, you know, I think people were pretty tickled by it. I think a lot of people didn't realize we were actually selling THC products. I think they just thought we were doing accessories. And I think there are a lot of people and we sold to a lot of older women, you know, more mature women. And I think we call them the boomerangs, you know, the boomers that smoked when they were young. And now we're kind of coming back to it as it's more normalized. And I think, you know, part of our hypothesis was we've been a brand for so long and we have consumer trust and other cannabis brands, they just weren't familiar with them. They don't know who they are, what they mean. And so for people to come to us to buy cannabis, you know, someone they know and trust like that would give people comfort. And I think especially for those older people, I think that happened. And I think a lot of those people were like really into this idea of buying like around Christmas when we launched and got so many older folks buying paraphernalia for their adult children. You know, they just thought it was so fun and it made them feel cool and that their kids would love it. So we had a lot of that. There was definitely like, especially on our original Instagram page, a lot of people were like, what's with all the weed? Like what's with all the smoky? And you know, there was not the Venn diagram of people that were buying bespoke bags from us for their wedding. And you know, wanted cannabis was was not was not big. But the truth is like, you know, we just felt that there was so much more opportunity there. And more than that, just it's so exciting. I mean, it just feels so exciting to be in this business at this stage really at the beginning of something. So we just had to weigh that against alienating some of our heritage customers and go forward. And how many states are you in at this point with with the THC product? So we sell THC in eight states and will be in 14 by year end, which I know doesn't sound like a big number, you know, we're into these international brands. But it's a huge deal. It's just really hard to be in multiple states. And, you know, everybody speculates that cannabis will be a brand game. And it's really hard to build a brand in cannabis for this reason, because it's really capital intensive to be in multiple states. And it's hard to, you know, build brand when you don't have national consistency. So we're really, really proud of that fact. And, and, and, you know, and think we have an opportunity to really mean something in the space. What are some of the retailers we talked again, we talked about the implosion of men, men, but and is it called Little Flower? I think that's what it is. It's sweet flowers. Sweet flower. Yes. Yeah. There's something. Oh, there's a there's a lunch spot in Pasadena called Little Flower. Sweet flower. It's really it's cute. Are there any other retailers that you're really like psyched about? I know that Joanne Wilson, who is married to Fred Wilson, who's a big venture capitalist, launched my husband is like a fan of all the Wilson's Emily and Joanne and Fred. They they're like into the kind of same restaurants we are. So he like, he knows Fred from covering him and my husband's also journalist for people. I always, I have to like, what I realized, I talked to Irie New Earth yesterday, which we didn't, we haven't even talked about that. You're both from Brentwood, but like, we talked about so many people and didn't use the last names. And I was like, no one's gonna know what these people are. But anyway, I know Joanne opened a shop more, more recently in New York, Gotham. But what are some of the retailers that you think are really cool in different places and and where as someone who does understand how the fashion industry works and merchandising and all of that? Like, what do you think is going to like, what's next for cannabis retail? Yeah, I think Gotham is really cool. I think Joanne's done a great job. She's opening two more shops. She's really like, you know, she's into building a cultural destination. You know, they participate in cool things in New York and their store is great. I think travel agencies doing a really good job in New York as well. I really believe that cannabis retail is not going to look how it looks today in like five years. I think that if there is any movement, federally, and you know, if rescheduling happens, I just think once again, it'll bring more trough to the space and then more talent from other industries. And I think that's what we need because I think there's so much opportunity in cannabis retail. And like, you know, will there be like right now it's like, it's a multi brand model. Will there be single brand stores? I think so. And so I just think it's like, it's still so early and there's still so much resistance. And so if anything changes, I feel like it's it's going to be like, you know, really great. What has your most popular product been in the THC space? It's so state dependent. And also, you know, every state, obviously, not only do they have their own rules, they have their own packaging regulations, they have their own, you know, form factor regulations, like everything is different. So we don't have all of our SKUs in all different states. But I think our disposable vape pens are rechargeable disposable vape pens are really like they're delicious. They're really fun. I can show you one since I do have it here. I've showed you these. I brought you this. But there's they're really beautiful just to describe them like the one that Brett just popped up is a beautiful green with a little lavender tip. Is that correct? Yeah. Or pink tip. But, you know, I you have showed them to me and I have used them not on work hours. One one of one of them in New York. And I really liked it. And again, like I'm not a big consumer of that drug only. It just isn't like it's some people like certain things. And but what I will say is I really enjoyed it and thought it was really, really nice and would seek it out. And buy it the next time I'm in New York if I had time. But I'm obviously working the whole time I'm in New York, so I never have time to do that. Well, we're coming back to California next month. So don't worry. Very exciting. But I think what's nice about that product is that, A, it's adorable. It lights up when you blow in like a fun color and it's a consistent skew. Like because we use these flavored terpenes, like you could it's the same in every state you buy it. And I think that harder to achieve, obviously, with loose flour. And I think our consumer and me personally, I like that. I like knowing what to expect and how something is going to affect me. How big of a consumer of cannabis are you? Do you smoke every day or? No, I do not. This, you know, I was a very, you know, casual smoker when I started this. Like, you know, Greg, as as you inferred, like, just look much more than I do. And so I would like smoke with him to watch a movie or, you know, but it's certainly like not part of my daily routine at all. I'm not a person who like, you know, smokes with a team and gets really creative and focused. But I must say, like, obviously, through all of our exploration and launching new product categories and launching gummies, I've been trying so much that it's just naturally like I've been enjoying it so much. And I think also getting older and being affected by alcohol a lot more. It's been a nice alternative. And then Greg and I were alone for the first time this summer. All three of our kids were away. And I did not know what to do with myself. And on morning one, he looks at me and he's like, let's get high and naked. OK, I mean, I guess that sounds fun. So we I've been smoking a lot more this summer just because, you know, I'm amazing. I'm alone and it's super fun. And I really appreciate it. Are they all at camp? They were all at camp. They're back now, which is great. It was really nice to have a break, but I miss them. You know, we've talked about this, but Greg's biggest advice to me was like. Just be around if you're around, your kids won't hate you. By the way, that's a great co-parenting. And like he's around, floating around the house and I'm like in the bathroom with them and cleaning up and making them stuff. But I'm glad he's just floating around somewhere. Like I love your love. And now I have a picture of you guys smoking weed naked in my head. You're welcome. I won't say in the New York Times shout out to Jessica again. I talked about sex in Canada, because I talk a lot about sex in Canada just too much clearly, but I really like, I think it's like one of the greatest things cannabis has to offer. And, you know, I talk about this all the time that alcohol is a desensitizer and cannabis heightens all your senses and like, you know, sex just feels much better with cannabis. And I did some of the New York Times around obviously and my in-laws and my parents and everyone were like, this is very revealing. So I'm glad that you too can now have an image of me and Greg's.

Speaking of that, have you been on Hillary Kerr's podcast, Second Life? Yes. No, just give another one. I think I was on, um, The Who What Where? No, maybe I was on Second Life. You were, I bet you were on Second Life because it's like about having a second career, but she is also really interested in this intersection of weed, sex, and women. Oh, is she? And there's, yes, you should talk to her. Oh, I should talk to her. Offline about this. Because I don't think we talked about that when I talked to her, but I would love to talk to her about that. She's very interested in it and believes that there is a ton of business opportunity there, which I would agree. It's, I mean, I am not even promoting my own brand now. I just think that like sex and cannabis for women is very real. And even if you have very little, and I don't smoke a lot when I smoke, like I have very little and it just makes everything feel better. It's really the truth. And as we age, it's just, I mean, not even as we age for a young person too, but it's, it's hard to not, I mean, I can't even, I'll stop myself here. I just, I concur with Hillary and there's a lot to explore. Yeah. This is a, this is another podcast that, that all of my male editors at puck probably would not listen to. Julie Ioffee will be right there. It's gonna be hanging on everywhere. She's, she's Julia's definite. I'm definitely going to send this to her and make sure she, you got to listen to this one. Um, and then you, but this is all, it is all related. Like these are all tab taboo, taboo topics that don't, the government regulation of this, the fact that women, it's, it's a women thing. Like the, it's about sex. It's a, and, and the fact that you are sort of kind of lary at all with having a fashion background and bringing like an aesthetic to it is, is unique. And, and is something, I hope more people, like, do you want, in some ways, I bet you kind of want more competitors just because it would like up the, a rising tide and all of that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I just wanted to feel not taboo. I mean, I will, since you were so interested in the G nine summit, I will say that one of the panel, Oh, you were there. Yes. I knew you were there. I was just like, Oh my God, I need to go. I know I'm never Amy, please Amy Griffin, please invite me. We'll talk to her. She's the greatest after she'd be thrilled to have you. It can be off the record. I just would love to like be there. I do that. Is there any press there? Other than, I mean, obviously there are photographers. Right. Is there any press like hanging out? I don't know. It would be a great New Yorker article. It's such an amazing day. She's so great. But I bring it up only because one of the panels was on women's health and specifically on menopause, but one of the women said his like a famous menopause doctor and I'm ashamed that I don't know her name, but I'd have to look it up. She's a superstar, but she was talking about how women's health is not just abortion, you know, when you talk about what's on the issue. And a member, it's not just abortion is women's health and how women's health just has not been studied. Even like a quarter of how much men's health is in study, like all the drugs that like even like lipotour and heart disease stuff, like that's all been studied on men. So when you give it to women, like our bodies are different. And so just again, like not the same, but I'm rounding it back to like women's health as we age and menopause and everything that's sex, you know, and that we think of as taboo, all the subjects are considered so taboo. They're so important. And I do think they are coming into the mainstream a little bit more. And and I think that cannabis is a really great solution for a lot of these issues. I really do. Have you read All Force? Ugh, I'm reading it. I don't like it. Am I the only one? OK, this is what I will say, because this will, I doubt this will ever come up on this podcast again. I love, I love that it has because it's All Forces Miranda July's novel, quote, unquote, but really memoir about being in your 40s and a woman. Essentially. I don't know if she talks about smoking marijuana or or anything in it. Maybe talks about gummies. I can't, I can't think. I listen to it on tape because I am unable to read books because I'm 40. I'm turning 42 tomorrow. Happy birthday. Thank you so much. It is I, I listen to it halfway through. I was like, OK, I'm out. I'm not finishing because like there's there's. A narrative that ends and I was like, I don't care anymore. I think you should finish it and I think you should just listen to it on tape. The ending is really satisfying. I think it's her masterpiece and also really well written, but but generally I think it's worth slogging through. But I would say listen to it when you're walking around the city or on the subway or whatever and don't or, you know, if you drive up to your to Connecticut by yourself for some reason, like listen to it because personally, I just I literally can't read a full book right now. I don't it's I don't know why, but I can't. Maybe maybe I'll figure it out someday. But I think it's it's interesting and it all interconnects with this and and these conversations are suddenly. Coming to the forefront and it's it's funny to think about like a fashion brand that also sells weed as being part of that, but it totally is. Yeah. OK, I will finish it on your recognition. Look, I think we think of ourselves as and this is, you know, it's a word you'll I roll, but like as a real lifestyle, like we're a cannabis lifestyle brand. So our focus is I roll. You can, it's fine. But but you know, this is we're trying. This is a cannabis lifestyle that we recognize and that we're all women in our office and so that like this is how we use cannabis, how we interact with cannabis. We think there's a real future customer in cannabis that, you know, looks like us, sounds like us, obviously much bigger than just us. But, you know, it's a it's a lifestyle that we think is a lot more than just like, you know, Cheech and Chong and all the the stigma around cannabis. We think it's like has medicinal properties, obviously, although we don't tout like health and wellness, but something that can be enjoyed. And it's like really for a good time and is really helpful. So I will finish the book and get back to you on being 40 in a woman's. Brett, you're the best. This was so fun. Congrats on everything. I'm so interested. It's it's it's fun to watch and cover from from the outside. But also it's just, you know, it's cool that you keep moving forward and doing different things. And and I think this is like important with a capital I. I think it's important, too. And I hope I'm really, really appreciate being on. I love everything you do, as you know. So I'm excited. But I appreciate you're saying that because I think it's it's really like it's going to be very, as you said, it's going to be important. It's going to be a huge, huge industry. And if alcohol is the analog, like that that's going to be something to reckon with. So yeah. And the great thing about it is it doesn't make you puffy. And you and you're not really hung over the next day. Please, if I may, not only that, it doesn't make you roity. It doesn't make you aggressive. It doesn't make you drive fast. It doesn't make you beat up your girlfriend, which, by the way, 80% of violent crime in this country is domestic. And how much of that do you think is alcohol related in and also and, you know, forgive me for giving me this opening. But it also is an alternative to opioids for pain management. So in all the states where cannabis has been legal medically, opioid prescriptions do decrease. And, you know, we don't have to talk about the relationship between opioids and death. So, you know, it's obviously like I because our brandy, those is for a good time and light and colorful and mostly just stick to like section cannabis and making people uncomfortable. But there is so much good that it does, you know, outside of that. Well, keep making people uncomfortable. That's what I would say. I really appreciate that. Thank you, Laura, and you're the best. I appreciate you. Thank you so much. This was so fun. Happy birthday. Wow. Thank you. See you soon. Fashion People is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck, hosted by Lauren Sherman.
