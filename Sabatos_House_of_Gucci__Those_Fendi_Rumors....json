Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman and today with me is the king of luxury analysts, Bernstein's Lukasoka. We're going to talk Gucci Resort and the show that happened yesterday in London, the battle between Tiffany and Cartier and what's happening at My Teresa. Plus as always, the rumor of the week. Hey everyone, I hope you had a good weekend. A Happy Mother's Day for those of you in the US. I actually was on a plane all Sunday, headed to London for this Gucci Resort show, which I'm recording this right before the show. The show happens. Technically I was at 9 p.m. London time tonight, which means it'll probably be closer to 10. But I am in my hotel room, waiting it out, getting ready to talk to Luca. I had lunch at the River Cafe today with the Gucci team and all the American editors. It was so nice. Highly recommended one of my favorite spots. Ruthie was there, the chef. It was as nice as usual. I'm also just wrapping up yesterday's line sheet, which hit your inboxes right around the time of the Gucci show. It's packed as usual. We had a little bit of breaking news. We also have the final update from the Kandey Nass content den. The kids are all leaving tomorrow. They're finally being released. So good luck to everyone involved. I'm glad we all get to move on. And my big story today is about Tiffany and Cartier and the sort of battle for the top spot in the hard luxury world. And Tiffany is definitely worth doing everything that they can to get close to Cartier, which is sort of the first name in fine jewelry. And so that's been an interesting thing to track over the last two years. And the Mecca last week or Jennifer Lopez wore this insane giant Tiffany necklace was sort of the latest development in that rivalry. I'm going to talk a bit about it with Luca as well. So let's get started. Luca, thank you so much for joining me on Fashion People. You're such a line sheet celebrity. Everyone's happy for you to be here to start. I am in London for this Gucci resort show. It's Sabato De Sarno's third show. I also figured I tack on some meetings. I don't normally go to the resort shows as I assume you don't either. But I wanted to hear what your sort of feelings were about the state of Gucci at the moment. Obviously, Caring has had a rough couple of quarters and things don't seem to be turning around that quickly. But Gucci in particular, what do you think of what Sabato has done so far? And what do you think they need to do to get it on track? It's clear that Gucci is still in transition. And to be fair, we saw very limited amount of the new Sabato De Sarno products in the quarterly updates we had so far. The company was very clear that the first quarter, which was down 20 percent, so only a very small fraction of the new products in the numbers. And at the same time, they added that the new products are getting good traction. So things possibly in a step-by-step manner should be improving from here. The feedback on the Sabato De Sarno collections improved when we looked at what we received in September relative to what we have heard in February for winter. The idea is that there seems to be a bit more spice and maybe that the first show was a little bit too guardable to blend. Clearly, there's two different goals that have to be reconciled here on the one hand. There's a need to make Gucci a bit more mainstream. It had become very extreme under Alessandro Michele in terms of aesthetics. In the most recent interpretations. And at the same time, we need to stay true to what Gucci's DNA is, which is a brand that is not known as a mainstream brand, but more of a brand that is appreciated when it is a bit over the top. If we think about Tom Ford and the sexy theme that he developed, or if we think about Alessandro Michele and the great success that Gucci had in that to brilliant to turn around started in 2015. Yes, so you mentioned spicy, which is a very internet word, Luca. But do you think to be more like a Louis Vuitton or a mainstream brand, as you said, what does that mean to you? Like, does that mean developing the loafer program or the bag program in a way that gets people super excited and they all want to have one, but that is fun and flirty or whatever, and not just super standard or too weird? Like, what does spicy mean to you that would get the consumer excited and get them to the next, you know, five billion dollars they want to make on top of the 10 they're already making? First of all, I don't know that Gucci needs to look a bit more like Louis Vuitton. I think Gucci needs to look like Gucci. Gucci is very strong and has a strong heritage and has a strong DNA. So I think that the challenge for any creative director is to interpret the brand in a way that is consistent to that DNA, but at the same time fresh and well plugged into the current side guys. That I think is the challenge, making it look like Vuitton could be the wrong approach. And I don't think that they are trying to do that, at least that is not my understanding. I just meant be like Vuitton in terms of its ubiquity. So like everyone has a Louis Vuitton bag, everyone to be that big and be a big mass brand, not that it would look exactly like it, but like how can it be as ubiquitous as Vuitton is, I guess my question for you, like what do they need to do? But that too, let me disagree because my sense is that Gucci has to be successful, same way as we told them. I don't think that any of the luxury brands in their right mind would want to be ubiquitous because we know what happens when brands become ubiquitous. They experience a meteoric rise and then suffer a catastrophic crash. I think we have a couple of examples from across the ocean in the US of accessible luxury brands that became ubiquitous and suffered the consequence back then. You wouldn't call Louis Vuitton ubiquitous? No, I think that ubiquity is in a case of death in this industry. I want us to be conveying the impression of being special because what you're promising consumers is that if they buy your product, they will be special and they will stand out. I don't think and that goes back to the discussion and the debate about exclusivity and inclusivity. I think that a perception of exclusivity and a desire to aspire into a brand is instrumental in creating the brand success. Having said that, I definitely agree with you when you say that the foundation of a successful Gucci going forward is definitely going to rest among other things on stronger iconic products. We see it from brands that have a very established position that iconic products never developed forever. You continue to upgrade, you continue to update, you continue to make them more interesting if we look at the watches industry and if we look at Rolex, you have a good example of that when you look at the likes of the Daytona and how it has evolved over time or if we look at the car industry, we have the 911 from Porsche and we see how it has evolved from one edition to the other. Clearly the Gucci loafers are part of that very iconic small group of designs that definitely benefit from updates and continuing upgrades and I would expect that that is going to be part and parcel of what the new Gucci will do. I think in the case of Gucci you also need something that is going to be perceptible, that is going to be visible, that is going to be having a tweak because that is what Gucci is about. It's a bit like Pepsi relative to Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola is mainstream, Pepsi is let's say spikier and more different but I think is Gucci to the fashion level, good space. Gucci is the Pepsi of fashion. Yes, I mean it's not only a classic brand, I would say it is a classic brand but it's also a brand with a twist and these two identities have to be coming to consumers at the same time if you see what I mean. A lot of work for Savado de Sarno but you feel like the indications in the market are slow but steadily improving. That is my impression, the feedback we've been receiving so far especially in the west has been improving. The jury is out on whether this could potentially translate into better numbers down the road and especially into better numbers when we look at the Chinese consumers. Clearly the success of the Alessandro Michele Gucci in China had been extraordinary and so it is to be seen if this new Gucci interpretation is going to be as exciting or not yet and what will be required for it to work in China. I think in China and the Chinese consumers are probably the most difficult challenge for Gucci at this stage.

So let's move on to a brand that is about to get very big in China potentially, which is Valentino. What do you think this appointment means for Valentino, which is like what, a billion and a half in annual revenue? It's partially owned by Caring with the potential to be fully owned right now. It's majority owner is Mayula, which is a Katari investment vehicle. What do you think about this appointment for Valentino? Do you think that this is a brand that's going to triple in sales pretty fast if if McKaylee has the same effect that he did on Gucci when he first got there about a decade ago? Definitely. Alessandro made history with Marco Bizzari and Jacopo Venturini in the turnaround of Gucci a few years ago. I don't think that we have any precedent as successful as the Gucci reinvention of 2015 and 2016. So a lot of merit goes to the ability of Alessandro to create a whole new world for Gucci. He has shown to be an incredible talent in this view. And if he managed to do the same for Valentino, then the prospects would be very good. Clearly, I think Valentino is in need of new creative energy. And I salute this change of creative directors because after the rock start, there was I think less of a sign that Valentino was really getting traction in the market. And the rock start has been there for a while. So there's definitely a need to push Valentino forward and make it a success. I think that in terms of potential and in terms of track record, there's hardly anyone that comes to mind could possibly be creating that magic for a brand like Alessandro McKaylee. Yeah, I think it seems really exciting. And also the CEO, he was the head of merchandising. I think I remember you wrote up, we both have written about him. He's fabulous and they made magic together at Gucci. So I'm super excited about it. And I think it feels like it could be a big thing for caring to in the future. Moving on to our friends at LVMH, which you can't even call them a rival anymore. They're in a class of their own. I have a big piece today looking at the Tiffany elevation brand elevation strategy and an executive, I kind of got thinking on this. I've been watching it obviously and Alexander knows work there running product and communications. And I did a piece last year on Line Sheet at puck.news if you want to check it out. But I have this piece that ran in line sheet yesterday about Tiffany's elevation strategy. They've hired all these people from Cartier and they really do seem to be trying to match Cartier or get close to Cartier and grab that Cartier consumer, which is, I would say from in the American market at least, Cartier is sort of the gold standard when it comes to like a standard fine jewelry brand or the big fine jewelry brands. That's what you want. Maybe an engagement ring you buy from Tiffany, but your wedding brands you buy from Cartier. And so I would say what I've seen in, and you can see this in the LVMH results to an extent, they sort of bury the Tiffany numbers, but it seems to be that the elevation is probably working a bit, but maybe not, not as quickly as they thought it would because of the slowdown in the US market and the Chinese market, Tiffany's two big markets. But I was curious from your perspective, analyzing those two businesses, how are they doing and has Cartier been hurt at all by Tiffany's efforts to make a dent in their market share? You know, I'm in Switzerland, so let me say this, it takes longer to climb the mountain than to descend it. In the case of Bulgari, the brand was very much operating at the highest end of the pricing range. And so the development of Bulgari was basically to convince consumers that they had an entry point in design jewelry to convince consumers that they had very attractive watches and products that you would be able to buy at less than $300,000, which was quite a steep price for some of the nicest Bulgari products before the LVMH acquisition. And I think that this has been done very effectively, including the very successful repositioning of leather goods, which before the LVMH acquisition at Bulgaria were a little bit of a nice ore. Moving Tiffany up is a more difficult challenge that has to be attacked from different points. Clearly, the upgrading of the retail network, as we've seen, starting with the main flagship in New York, clearly the introduction of more design jewelry collections with the successful lock that has been added to the range that Tiffany had, the maintaining and the upgrading of the silver collection, which is a great entry price. But then the development of Tiffany at the higher end, of which we saw some. For example, I remember the Yellow Diamond collection and the Yellow Diamond advertising that Tiffany had brought to the market. But there's clearly more that has to come on that front, including, I think, a continuing upgrade of the communication. And remember, prior to the acquisition, Tiffany was often communicating about entry price products, which is a no-no in the luxury goods industry, and which is typical instead of retailers. So Tiffany, to some extent, was round as a retailer. Prior to being acquired by LVMH, there's a change of approach that is in the making. But some areas have yet to be attacked almost entirely. I'm thinking that in watches, Tiffany is probably where Bulgari was in handbags prior to being acquired, so it's nowhere to be seen. And when we think of Cartier, Cartier has a huge amount of revenues coming from watches. So I would call this work in progress. And, expectedly so, it took 10 years to develop Bulgari at the level where it is at the moment. It's probably going to take at least as much for Tiffany to blossom. I feel like there's more pressure for it to happen more quickly. It may just be because they have more marketing behind it than they had at Bulgari, which seems to be doing extremely well by all accounts if you read in between the lines of the earnings. And as you mentioned, they just hired Mary Katrantzu, a Greek-British designer to do their handbags. But the thing for Tiffany to me is, yeah, it was positioned as an accessible luxury brand. When you think of Tiffany, you think of coach bags. You don't think of Louis Vuitton bags. And so I wonder, the silver seems like a huge opportunity. And how do you elevate that while also getting more people to spend $300,000 on a necklace? Or, you know, they had a watch store within the Tiffany. Do you remember this? That was not, it was a separate brand? Yes, I think the Tiffany was distributing the Patek Philippe watches at one point, at least in the US. What I mean is that in watches, they don't have an iconic product of their own, comparing contrast against the Octo Finissimo or against the Serpenti watch at Bulgari. You don't have families, product families that are so compelling and so recognizable at Tiffany today. I mean, down the road, I'm sure they will work to make this possible. The other thing is clearly Tiffany is very sparky as far as consumer appeal across geographies. I think it is clearly stronger in the US and weaker elsewhere, including in Asia. So there's more work to be done to make it, let's say, equally attractive across the three major regions. And you know, that is definitely adding to the to-do list. And we know that moving brands and nurturing brands is not done overnight. We clearly need time. And of course, everyone would want to see results sooner around then later, including the market. But we need to be sort of cognizant that moving brands takes time. Yeah, really quickly on Cartier, because it's interesting you mentioned watches. And there's been a real surge in the US, I would say, among a certain cohort of women who are luxury consumers buying watches. I don't know if that can be, if that's anecdotal, and that's just my friends. Or if it's people, if it can be seen in the market. But most of the women I know buy Cartier watches, or a couple have Rolex, a couple have Patek Philippe. But mostly it's Cartier to go with their love bracelets and their Trinity rings and their Trinity necklaces. And so it's an interesting thing that you mentioned. How do you think Cartier is managing this new competition? Because they were the only game in town for the last 15 years in terms of being something that people interested in fashion, the fine jewelry is fashion quota, like they were really the only ones doing that. How do you think they're responding? Are you impressed by the product rollout they've had in the last couple of years, or how they're managing this new wave of competition? I think that they clearly have quite a challenge which is coming from a number of directions, including I think some of the soft luxury mega brands getting into jewelry. We haven't mentioned Chanel, for example, or Odior moving into jewelry themselves. Everyone seems to be so interested in jewelry. Recently, look at Gucci and they're moving to jewelry as well. So the category is definitely attracting a lot of interest. And in our recent report, we have shown how lab grown diamonds are also attracting new competitors. Fred has launched a blue diamond collection. But more importantly, the jewelry retailers like Pandora have launched quite a significant and ambitious foray into the category, even inventing a new punchline. It used to be that the beers said that diamonds are forever. And Pandora is saying today diamonds are for everyone. So there's clearly a lot moving in the jewelry space, which makes it then for the incumbent ruler, because there's no denying that Carquiette sits at the very top of the packing order in terms of the jewelry category. It makes it more of a challenge for them to shape up and impress and convince consumers that they remain the best game in town. And I think that on that front, Carquiette has been very, very convincing in the high end. I think that their limited edition series are incredible. I think that they've been very convincing in the entry price where they have very many design jewelry collections. I wonder if there's opportunity in the $20,000 to $100,000 space for Carquiette to grow even more, because we see that in that space, for example, for Cliff and Appels, and maybe even Bulgaria have done more progress. So we got to get moving, but I really do just want to say very quickly that there has been a rise in editor press trips for high jewelry. So the fashion brands plus Cartier and Van Cleef or whatever are now bringing editors on these high jewelry client trips. And that is post COVID. It's something on this Gucci trip. I'm sort of on the outskirts of it because I am here on Puck's Dime, not on Gucci's, but I was with editors today and we were all talking about it. And it's pretty fabulous. I'm going to definitely do a story on it. If you plan on going on one of these trips, definitely hit me up because I'm obsessed with these high jewelry, luxurious trips with the private clients. But really quickly before we get to the rumor of the week, a quick fire one for you. A couple of weeks ago, I reported that my Teresa hired a banker and they were either considering a take private or a potential purchase of YNAP or both or something. Today, WWD followed up on that and reported a similar thing. They said they actually hired two bankers. Whether or not any of this is happening. I know it is. I know they hired a banker, but the question for you is, what do you think about the idea of my Teresa somehow merging with YNAP and doing it? I mean, they'd have to do a take private, but like you've been covering the online luxury wars for longer than I have or as long as I have. And you saw the writing on the wall for YNAP and Far Fetch basically before anyone else. And I remember you told me that Far Fetch might just close and I was like, no, there's no way that would happen. And then two months later, they almost just closed. So I'm curious what you think of this potential merger or mash up between my Teresa and YNAP. And if you think it's going to solve any of these retailer's problems, if it happened, it's ambitious. And I'm not sure that it would provide a huge amount of solutions to the current issues, maybe from a technology viewpoint. I'm not sure. But one of the problems that the multi-brown digital retailers or marketplaces have been suffering from is traffic and consumer appeal. If you try and drive traffic on the back of promotions and discounts, then it's difficult to reconcile GMV growths and having a positive bottom line, which I think was always the issue at Far Fetch. And I think that the solution must come from being very different and having a very clear opinion and curation of the assortment. I think that on that front, my Teresa has been doing well and has been doing also quite an efficient job in terms of being closer to profitability, despite significantly smaller scale, for example, of Far Fetch. And we published a report to highlight that my Teresa was 30%ish points closer to breakeven than Far Fetch had been in the most recent three or four years. I don't know that sheer scale and adding, let's say, the power of YNAP to the power of my Teresa would necessarily make things easier, maybe again on technology, maybe on logistics. But these are not necessarily the most important costs. Some of the most important elements would be traffic. And that, I think, remains to be seen whether sort of putting together more companies that have a different profile, have a different mission, like Yuxes end of season, for example, would necessarily put you in any better position than where you are today. So a very interesting point to watch. Mistweed this weekend was quite adamant, anticipating that this would hardly be a possibility. I have no better information than that.

So last week in New York, a big rumor that sort of popped out of the Met Gala, Pier Apollo, our friend Pier Apollo was at the Met Gala with his daughter. Valentino was not there. I heard that they did buy tables, but they decided to hold off because Alessandro's going to debut in September would be kind of weird for his first pieces to debut at the Met Gala. So they didn't end up attending. But Pier Apollo was there, and there was this rumor going around that he was potentially going to Fendi. Look, everybody, there was also a rumor that Alessandro was at Fendi, that he was already working there, you know, every, but there's all these rumors. Maybe Fendi will just keep its designers who are Sylvia Fendi and Kim Jones. Who knows? But the bigger question for me is, I mean, unless you have an opinion about whether Pier Apollo should be at Fendi, I'm curious to know from your perspective, LVMH is so big now. Its biggest brands are over $10 billion a year. Louis Vuitton is over $20 billion a year. I heard up to $22 billion. A brand like Fendi, which is like under $5 billion a year, these brands like Celine get inching towards $5 billion. What do they mean to the LVMH portfolio at this point? Because you also have the hospitality. You have the hard luxury. You have the wine and spirits, which is, you know, that's a whole other podcast, not for us, but well, not for me. But what do you think of these like sort of mid-level brands that are big brands and that people like Givenchy's another example under a billion still, but is a name everybody knows? Is it worth it for LVMH to like invest a lot in these businesses and try to make them as big as Dior and Vuitton? Or is it better to sort of just let them ride? Like what do you think the role of these sort of secondary and tertiary brands are in that portfolio at this point? I think that the same way as you not only have elephants in, you know, in the jungle or in the bush, but you have many different animals. The same way in the luxury and fashion market, you have niches and space for many different players. The important thing, I think, is not necessarily to make them all as big as Vuitton. This is going to be impossible the same way as Zebra is not going to be a lion anytime soon. But the important thing is to make them successful in their own specific way. When you think about Loro Piano, for example, that's a good example of a brand that occupies a niche that is very specific and very special to it, very successfully. So I think that all of these brands have to be different. And in this respect, this is similar to what I was saying about Vuitton and steroids. It doesn't make sense for brands to try and be something else other than what they are and what their DNA suggests. Each brand is different. Each brand plays a different role and attracts certain clients and means certain things in the minds of consumers. So I think in the case of Vandy, their history is so different, their connection to Fer, their connection to Rome. This is what I think has to come through and has to be interpreted in a way that is relevant in today's market. If this requires a new creative director and if this requires Piccioli, frankly, I don't know. But Freddie would benefit from a stronger momentum. I don't know that this has been on the front foot among the many different brands that LVMH disposes of. Some of them are sort of progressing faster. Some of them are progressing less so. I think that Fendi is probably somewhere in the group, somewhere in the middle of all that with potential to grow and potential to be distinct from everything else, which I think is the appeal of having brands like Fendi in the portfolio. So in my view, the appeal of having a portfolio comes from diversity and comes from these brands being able to do different jobs.
