And today with me on the show is Puck's very own retail correspondent, Sarah Shapiro. We're talking the future of the row, executive changes at a way, the latest in tariffs, and plenty more. Happy Tuesday everyone. Hope you are having a great week. I ventured over to Rodeo Drive last night to see the new Tori Birch store and have dinner with that crew at Mr. Charles. Everyone was there because everyone loves Tori. It was really fun. I really do love everyone involved and we had a great time. I have a very busy week this week, including going to a taping of Everybody's Live on Wednesday. That is John Mulaney's live talk show that is filmed here in LA. I'm very excited. It just so happens that my colleague Matt Bellany is interviewing John Mulaney next week at Puck's Story of the Season event, also in Hollywood or West Hollywood or somewhere like that. I'll also be there. I'm going to sit down with White Lotus star Parker Posey. If you have any questions for Parker related to the show or how she works with costume designers or why she's so funny, hit me up. If you're in Los Angeles and want to attend our event, which is happening May 20th, email fritz at park.news. Members of the various academies and guilds will be prioritized, but I am sure we can make room for you. Let's get going, Sarah. Sarah Shapiro, welcome to Fashion People. Hi. Great to be back. How's it going? How was your weekend? My weekend was great. Did you do a lot of channel checks or did you avoid? You've been really channel checking the world over. Yes. Well, and I have a few channel checks planned for during the week this week. Sometimes it's easier for me to get to the stores during the week, but this weekend I did not hit up any. I'm happy for you. We're going to talk about a few of your channel checks later that you've done previously. To start really quickly on this tariff news, apparently China and the US have reached some sort of semi-deal. I don't want to get too much into it because literally this publishes, we're talking Monday morning, this publishes Tuesday morning. It could have changed, but essentially, can you just very, very quickly explain what the US-China tariff agreement entails? Yes. So it sounds like there is, and again, who knows because this continues to change, but a 90-day pause, which will bring the tariffs back down to 30% for Chinese imports, which had been at 145%. Then China is reducing their tariffs on American goods that they had set at 125% to 10%. Okay. So this is to allow businesses to figure things out and potentially for deals to be had as well. Yeah. Okay. Let's not talk about what actually, what the implications of this specifically are because, I don't know, but the thing was, I was talking this weekend with an executive. I just feel like the disruption of this, wherever you live, whatever's happening, I assume the 90-day pause on the European tariffs is up soon. I know that there are a lot of brands that are getting or companies that are getting exceptions, things like that, but it's just so disruptive to the businesses. And this executive was like, a lot of these companies, no matter, kind of no matter what happens, they're not going to survive this because they've been spending all this time rearranging their supply chains. And then what if, like this person said, what if he decides Vietnam or Cambodia, which is where a lot of the bigger companies or a lot of the lower price companies produce quite a bit of stuff, or even if you're not producing stuff there, you may have parts coming from these. Places. What do you think, four years from now, what do you think the shakeout is going to look like of all this? So I don't think a lot of these tariffs are impacting. The idea of just figuring out your supply chain is already needs to happen. Like it needs to just be diversified because of changes that happen and not being too reliant on one factory, because even that factory could just go under, not even related to all the tariffs. The thing that I'm actually seeing the biggest impact on is all the confusion and what this is happening at the ports or shipping, not necessarily through the ports, but just through FedEx and DHL and UPS and stores that ship direct like online e-commerce deciding if they're going to pause shipping to the US because what's going on and all the confusion and what duties are popping up when somebody receives their package. That to me is where I'm actually hearing so much more of confusion and impact for the consumer and for stores as opposed to the tariffs directly. Well, stay tuned. This is a developing story that we can't get rid of as much as we try. The other, you also had a piece in Monday's newsletter about Jen Rubio, the CEO of Away, stepping down from that role. She was also one of the co-founders of Away and became the CEO a few years ago after their original CEO exited her co-founder in the business. Can you tell us a little bit about the new CEO of Away and what you think? I love any category where I see a real quote unquote white space as they love to say in the marketing world. I think luggage is there's Samsonite, there's Toomey, there's cheap stuff, and then there's Ramoa or Remova, whichever way you want to pronounce it, I think both are acceptable. But Away has really overtaken this market of people who are too sensible or feel like Ramoa is too expensive, but who could probably afford Ramoa. It's a pretty savvy customer. When I travel a lot, I'm at the airport and there are just so many of these luggage bags. Can you tell me a little bit about how the company's doing and who this new CEO is and what you think she'll bring to the table? Yeah, so the new CEO is Jessica Shinazi. I've had the opportunity to check in with her a couple of times, but what I think is really interesting is her background. She was most recently based in Chicago and was the president of the America's business of Dyson, which as we know from Dyson has quite a few products, but in this space is really known for their airwrap and for their hair dryer. So again, it is a product that disrupted an industry that came in from the outside and also is a little bit more expensive than some of the others, although now the whole industry has come up, I think, around it and you have T3 and all the other players in there too, but it created another way to do a product and it also grew their business through third-party retailers. They also have some of their own stores. So there's quite a lot of similarities between the businesses. Her background was also at, she's had Stents at Alvi, at May, Richmont, Amazon. So all of these things that in addition to a new CEO coming in, she had joined, Shinazi had joined the company in late 2024 and was already starting on some other new projects, which are that they're going to be launching in Nordstrom's 60 stores as well as online and that will get them much more people being able to view the product in person and they will also be on Amazon stores or on Amazon. Were they weren't on Nordstrom prior? They weren't in Nordstrom prior. Are you sure about that? They currently have not been, although it's launching now. I do not know if they weren't at some point. There are other brands like BASE. So, I mean, if you think of the luggage space, there have been so many competitors that have come up. I often think of the luggage space that's similar to Casper and all the mattress brands that popped up. And so there have been other luggage companies that have popped up. You could certainly get a hard-sided suitcase, rolling suitcase from other retailers, but they have not been on Nordstrom before. That's fascinating. So you have this item on Monday and then you're going to talk to them more next week. So stay tuned for that.

Listen to and follow Aspire With Emma Greed, an Odyssey podcast available now, wherever you get your podcasts. The other thing I wanted to chat with you about is Donnie, this brand-DONNI. You have a big piece on Tuesday about Donnie, which has become a big topic of conversation during our Friday editorial meetings. And also, just among our, I'd say, the subset of American customer age 30 to 50, essentially, many of whom are moms. Happy Mother's Day, by the way. I don't know if you saw the piece. Just a side shout out to the team at Vogue who published the Don't Call Me Mama piece, which it's fine and my kid calls me mama. I don't want a fitness instructor calling me mama. I don't want to see mama on a t-shirt and I don't want to see mama anywhere where they say you got this mama. My friend Molly Creedon, who is a writer who has a full-time job, so she was never able to pitch the mama dialogue story. But she has been wanting someone to write this, why it's offensive to call someone mama for the last three years. And now, thank you to Vogue and Amanda Hess, who is the author of this piece, who wrote the mama thing. But anyway, there are a lot of moms wearing this brand-DONNI. I'm aligned with you there. Yeah. And if you love being called mama by your fitness instructor, that's okay too. It personally really bothers me and I find it annoying. But can you explain a bit for our listenership who has never heard of Donni, what it is and why we are so interested in it. The cut also just did a big piece on it. What makes this business so fascinating? Yeah, I think it is. It's fascinating to me also because it depends on what community you're in. Either you're totally aware of this brand or completely unaware because it has, you know, so it's a D to C direct-to-consumer business. There's no stores that are Donni stores. So the brand is sold directly. The founder is Alyssa Wosco. Well, she does sell at Summary to Summary to. Yes. So that's why I was going to say she is on Shop Up. She is on Revolve, Fair, some boutiques that also have it, but it is pretty limited that you wouldn't just like, you could walk down the street and run into a J-Crew store or Madewell and it's not the same for that brand. So I have found like in my own community, the people that wear Donni tend to be somebody who is in the fashion industry in some way. So I personally am not seeing it at school pick-up drop-off or sports weekend games. I'm not going to reveal my friend's school, but let's just say this is a guy I know who is connected to the fashion industry, but doesn't, I wouldn't say works in the fab, but is connected as you said. So would be aware of this and his wife works in fashion. So says and goes to a school in his kid goes to a through kindergarten through 12 or preschool through 12 private school in the Valley that many of our listeners and you know, you definitely know someone. What does he say to, he said to me, and this is a school with like quote unquote more creative types, but I asked around and it does seem to be popping up at a lot of the private school drop-offs in LA. Let me find what he said. He said, what's up with Donnie? It's high key the rich private school mom pick-up pan. So I think, and I think from I ran into when I was in New York, I had brunch or breakfast, whatever on. Sounds like I don't, I was just talking to someone this morning about I don't really go to brunch. Like I don't, I don't think of it as brunch, but I had breakfast in Trayvon. We ate though, right? Yeah. I eat like a 11am breakfast lunch situation usually. I ran into Ruthie Freeland, our friend of the pod, who is who actually worked with the, what's the founder's name? Alyssa Wasco. Alyssa Wasco, yeah. Alyssa Wasco at Chanel, because Ruthie used to work in PR at Chanel and then she, Alyssa was a visual merchandiser, but she was wearing the Taffeta pull-on pants that I've also seen my friend Becky Malinsky wear on Instagram and seem to be, they did a big gifting, it sounds like around them, and the which you were, you reported on, but the pull-on Taffeta pant is really cute. I find this brand very interesting and the reason, A, it's, it just feels like a Sarah Shapiro coated brand. It's, it's like your sweet spot of a lot of heavy on the DTC, California, entrepreneurial, also a decent size business. Well, how much would you pin the business to at this point, like in terms of revenue? So the estimate that I have is 10 to 20 million. I asked for comment and they don't comment on their numbers as many brands don't, but I think that sounds accurate. And I think if I can give a little bit of context about the pants, because I will agree, like the current pant is the Taffeta, they did it in red and white and blue and white gingham, there's also solids, and the colors are like corn or there's another blue, light blue color, and they just, Yeah, like corn flower blue. It's really, they're really pretty or like a really nice red. Yes. Yes. So they get their colors really right. I think for a lot of this, they're like piece dying and panel dying. So the construction is, you know, definitely thoughtful. It's made in LA, but the pants back to the rib kick flare, which is probably the one that is seen all over it, drop off. It is recognizable even like the Viori performance pants, you know, it's the Viori performance pants also because it has that little V logo on it. Yeah. The white tag. These don't have any logo, but it is also so identifiable because it is a thick rib pant with the seam down the front, very much like a high sport seam down the front. And very much when that pant was totally taking off, this pant is the same silhouette and you know, the rib kick flare has been popular in the 50s and 60s, like it's a style that comes back. But in this particular material, it also happens to be a great, you know, even though we're not saying mama pant, but like it's a great pant for that kind of thing because you can put it on. It doesn't look like a piece of athleisure or workout gear, but you could still go on a walk with it, be messy on the playground, go to work and look like you're wearing a regular pair of pants. And it's not, like it's easy to throw in the wash. It's like all of those kind of things that made it sit. So these items have their moments and that they're identifiable. And I think that's like an interesting marketing point for these brands. It's funny. So I surveyed people who go to Harvard Westlake, Oakwood, Hollywood Schoolhouse and the Center in Los Angeles. And then also UCLA Lab School where we know people where because Laurel Panton, I would say, who's a writer and fashion editor and all these things that has a big subsec, she's sort of the like poster child for these pants and this brand. I'm sure that Laurel is the first person to ever wear them that I saw and like wear the knits and all that stuff. My friend who goes to the center says, and is a very discerning, let's just say discerning fashion customer, former fashion editor says, I said, do people at the center where Donnie assuming no, but trying to get a sense of who's buying it? This person responds, not that I know of. I don't know anyone who wears that. Look, this person, I would say is probably not looking at other people's clothes. Hollywood Schoolhouse, Oakwood, Harvard Westlake and UCLA Lab School all have Donnie in there. And what I think is interesting about this brand, the pant does look a lot like the ribbed pant does look a lot like the high sport pant. It fits, you have both, right? So it doesn't fit the same way. The high sport pant is like thicker, correct? Yes, the high sport is thicker and feels much more, I don't think I would say like a professional pant, but like it feels more like something whereas, and I love both of these. I mean, this, the kick flare pant for anybody who wants to know details about me, I just love wearing this kind of silhouette. Yeah, and you're petite, so it really works well on you. I am five too, yes. So and the Donnie one, I was fine with it at the full length, but I did end up getting it altered and that worked fine. So that's the other thing, you can alter it. The high sport, you can alter. But the Donnie one also, it just feels so much looser. Like it feels almost like, I mean, not a pair of sweatpants, not a pair of leggings, but it's the same kind of like comfort feel. Yeah, I get it. So what I think Alyssa has done Alyssa Wasco, because Alyssa Zachary is the founder of high sport. What Alyssa Wasco has done with this Donnie brand, which obviously I'm not a consumer of this brand. Like we're seeing Ruthie in these taffeta pants. I was like, oh, they look so good. But honestly, I'm not, it's a little trendy for me. Like I get too wrapped up in, I don't want something, I want to, when I buy something, I want to be able to wear it for the next four years on the regular. Like I want to know that I'll still be wearing it four years from now. That doesn't mean I don't cycle stuff out. But when I buy stuff that's trendy, I tend to get very mad at myself. And so I really try not to. And so I love it all. I think it looks good. Her nits look really nice. Laurel, I remember sort of wearing the nits really early. And the thing I would say is she is sort of taking from a lot of the more expensive brands like the Row, Highsport, Totem, which is like a diffusion of the Row or what I like, they're all sort of playing off the same things. And you can't say, it's really hard to say like, this person copied this person because all this stuff, none of it is original. It's just like sort of the flavor in the air. And what I think Alyssa Wasco has done really well is pick up the right colors. Like she has a great sense of color. She has a great sense of silhouette and what people want. And also what people are willing to, the price value equation. So how much people are willing to spend is a big part of this. And also, I don't want to reveal your whole piece. I think people should talk, should look at it. But the final thing is you did just because a lot of this stuff sells out. And the thing you and I have been talking about that, that Mickey Drexler has really imparted on me is if it sells out, it means you didn't buy enough. I mean, that's always my first question when I hear something sells out. It's like, how many did they actually make? I mean, that's the, your sell through of 100% is not great if you didn't buy that much of it. Yeah, totally, totally. Okay. So more on Donnie in Tuesday's email. You should definitely, everyone should check it out. It's a really fun, fun piece. The process of accepting insurance outside of a group practice can be tough.

Really, really quickly, I wanted to chat with you about the Barney's announcement that there might be a Barney's New York television show. I have many more details in Monday's line sheet. The people who are producing this is this woman, Susan Rovner, I believe her name is, who used to run NBC Universal. She has a production company and she partnered with Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage who are the people behind the original Gossip Girl and the Gossip Girl reboot and a bunch of other stuff. But most people know them from Gossip Girl. The OC. Do they do the OC also? Interesting. So the OC, they have a first look deal which it means what it sounds like it means. I was like, do I need to describe what this means in my piece and I decided no. Because it just means that you go to the studio first and if they don't want to, you could tell it elsewhere. But it's with Amazon and the first project they say they're doing is a show about Barney's New York. Let's not get into the details here because I did more reporting. You can find out exactly what's going on in my piece. But the question for you is, do you think this is a good idea? In any form, no matter what happens. Because the thing about Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, I talked to some of my Hollywood friends and I wouldn't call them sources. It's just people who know these people and are connected about this. They do get a lot of stuff done. A lot of these things. I was talking to a writer the other day that she's developed 10 things over the last five years and none of them have gotten produced. But she's made a lot of money. It's just such a weird business. But it's not a weird business. Sorry, I don't want to offend anybody. But to me, it is as someone who writes something and it gets published 20 minutes later. But there is a big chance this will actually happen. So do you think what would you want out of a Barney's television series? This is so tough because the nostalgia about Barney's is great. But if you don't actually have the experience of being able to go into a Barney's and discover the new product, I don't know if it means much. But I will say that all of these shows in the same vein, like I will watch any action show that comes out at least once. Give it a chance for the first episode to see if they can really nail what the world is like, what the behind the scenes are, all of that. But I don't know if it has the same pull that when Gossip Girl the reboot didn't have the same pull that the first Gossip Girl had in terms of the impact on the industry. I mean, Blair Waldorf wore a headband and then everybody had to wear a headband. And I don't know if we see shows that have that same sort of pull. So rebooting a show or creating a show about Barney does that mean that Barney's comes back? I don't think so. Well, that's the question. And also, do we want... I've been writing about Barney so much lately and there's going to be more because Gene Pressman, one of the former owners of the Pressman family, his dad founded Barney's. He has a book coming out in September. So this is going to just become a much bigger storyline for us. And I would just say I had a column a few weeks ago about Barney's and because they're still Barney's in Japan, it's through a separate deal. It's been operating there since the 80s, but it looks sort of like the Barney's of 2016 after Mark Lee, who sort of the developer Richard Perry, who bought Barney's and once told one of his... I don't know if Richard actually said this, but I was told by one of the Barney's employees that he was like, for me, this is like owning the Yankees. But Richard Perry owned it and he enlisted Mark Lee, this amazing executive, to sort of remake Barney's. And the Barney's that he remade is the one that is still alive in Japan and it's just like creepy. It truly is like a zombie. You just, you look at it and it looks like nothing's changed in the last 10 years. But I just think, I don't know, I would be interested in... Have you ever read Judith Kranz's Skruples? Do you know what? I don't think I've read it, but I know the lore. Yes, I'm a big reader. So good. Well, you don't need to be a big reader to read Skruples, but Hilary Kerr recommended it to years ago. And it's so good. It's basically based on Georgie O'Beverly Hills, that big, that store that was on, I think it was on Rodeo for years, that was very famous. And it's a fictionalized version and it's basically a soap opera. I was just thinking about it the other day, something else conjured it. And I feel like it could be really fun. I just don't think you need to use Barney's. The other thing that my deepest concern about it is what they're going to put in the store. Because the biggest problem with fashion stuff generally is when there's a fashion show, a runway show like fashion television series, when there's a runway show, or there's a collection, or there's... We've discussed at length on this podcast about Emily and Paris and what they get right about fashion, what they get wrong. I think the way Emily dresses is a little bit out there, but is extremely fun and a sort of exaggeration of what a PR girl who lives in Paris who's American would wear. But that doesn't bother me. I think that that's fabulous. The thing that bothers me is when they do like... It's kind of like writing a rock song for a TV show. If you don't get it right, it's really... Like most people don't get it right. Just don't show the runway. Don't do that. If you have to have a whole store, what show was I watching recently? Oh, I watched this movie where the girlfriend starts dating a new guy and he's a fashion designer and they had the shop. And the clothes are just... I was like, well, this is so bad. That's what I'm nervous about. Like what do they fill the racks with? Maybe they could CGI designer clothes onto the racks, but that is the part of it that I'm like, it would be better for them to do something set in the 80s or 70s where you could make it... That would cost a lot more money. Costume dramas are very expensive, but it just would be way more fun, I think, for it to be... If they set it at Barney's in 1982 when they had all this Armani and all the Japanese designers and stuff on the racks or there's that store... Did you ever see Mr. Selfridge, that show? I loved that show because it was set... Wait, who was in it? Someone good was in it, right? Yes. Oh, I... The same guy from Jeremy Piven. Oh, yeah, yeah. I don't... Yeah, that... Yes, yes. No, I did not watch it. I loved seeing the behind the scenes of a department store and what it was like to run it, and there the products... It was so old, like, you wouldn't expect to see their hands. Yeah, it was set in the late 1800s or something, right? Or the early 1900s. Yeah, I mean, I think a really fun thing would be to do a thing set at Charivari, which was like... It was this amazing store on the Upper West Side owned by this family, and it was awesome, and it was like all the cool people worked there, and it was like in the 1980s, there was a... I'd be more interested in something like that, or you could do Barney's too. Like, it's fine. It's just... I'm nervous for what do you put on those racks, also, just the whole thing is... I don't want to mention any of the plot details, because I think what was originally reported is probably incorrect, and so I'm doing reporting as we speak to clarify, and so once I clarify a little bit, and I'll keep up on this story, because it really is the cross-section of all our interests. So we should run soon, but really, really, really quickly, since we're talking about all of our favorite brands today. I did a column on Monday about the row, and I think everyone should check it out. It's sort of an extension of the podcast I did about the row with Misty Whitesidell from The Times, just discussing what are the prospects for this brand. Long term, I think there are very few founders with such discipline and ability to stay the course, but I do... I kind of bring up this idea of that we don't think of the row as being like a pandemic era or a pandemic boom success story, but they really are. At the same time, people... The reason people were buying sweatpants or the reason people were buying the row is just a slightly more niche customer because of the price. It's prohibitive prices, but what happens when you become the sort of basics... Matt Schneier did a piece on them right before the pandemic, actually, that was sort of about you either shop at Uniqlo or the row, or I think a lot of people shop at both. But what happens when that sort of basic, simple style is no longer the fashion conversation. I think the conversation for minimalist fashion and people who like minimalism has become a lot more about looking sexy, looking a little edgier, and that's been driven quite a bit by Phoebe Filo, but other designers as well. You see it across the market now where there's a great quote from Alexa Chung in a recent profile that she spent her whole 20s trying not to dress sexy. I think there is a thing happening in the culture where people who were probably not interested in bandage dresses in 2008 are now like, oh, I didn't wear a bandage dress in 2008. I'm 45 years old. I want to wear something nice and try to not completely hide my body. That's sort of the antithesis of a lot of the row silhouettes and things. I'm just curious as someone who follows the market and follows all of these brands super closely, what you think about the current state of that business and where you think it needs to evolve in order to stay at pace with the culture. Yeah, I still see the impact on the row on various brands. They're most recent and some of it is just their styling. Yeah, it's so much the styling. Right now, I'm seeing so much of people stylist and fashion pieces talking about wearing multiple shirts at the same time. That was very much what was in the last lookbook for the row and has been. Wearing the short sleeve and the tank over the long sleeve top, which is a different way of layering, but I also think back to the row with that. I think they're still relevant in a lot of the parts there. In terms of the business, I mean, their clothing also got very casual. I think some customers are dressing, I don't know if I would say like suits and skirt suits again, but we're definitely dressing up again in that kind of way. If the row can also pivot towards that, I think they keep their customer engaged and keep growing. Yeah, they'll definitely keep growing. I think there right now when you look at the lookbook, the styling is really directional. You're right. Like the t-shirt over the long sleeve, the skater kind of 90s look, plaid shirt wrapped around the waist type thing and it is giving other brands and it's giving people just a sort of guidebook. We don't have Lucky Magazine anymore, but we have the Rose Lookbook and Let's To Ket, the best magazine in the world. But I think the thing that's interesting is they have been so careful about growth. They grew pretty slowly, especially at the beginning. Before anyone knew that they had legit design chops, these are two celebrities who were making $400 t-shirts in 2009 or maybe they were $250 at the time. But they could have distributed even more widely than they did and blown up really fast and they were careful and did slow controlled growth. I think during the pandemic, they kind of by accident, A, their handbag business finally really took off and they became, it was the perfect confluence of things. People were sick of designer logo handbags and they made an alternative to Hermes that was slightly more accessible, not only in terms of price, although now it's probably pretty similar, but in terms of you can just buy it online when none of us were really leaving our house so you could get the Margot bag if you ordered it online. And then on top of that, it was the silhouettes and things in the way that they, like a big shirt, a pair of slacks. I bought a couple pairs of the Igor khakis when they were really big, like that pleated pant that just became everything that became the silhouette of post-pandemic. And then the biggest thing I think is other than handbags, their shoe business is their shoes are amazing. Like they're just, there's nothing else. I was just looking, we have a bunch of events coming up. I'm going to buy a pair of shoes from them. Like there isn't anyone else doing shoes the way they do them just exactly right. But I would say that like when I was looking for something for this event, there wasn't anything that I was like, oh, I would like to wear this for an event. What your people are investing differently. And it doesn't mean that like the row is going down. It's more about to me, and it was more of an existential question of, you know, they just raised a ton of money at a $1.1 billion valuation. They sold a little under 40% of their business. The partners that they chose are long-term thinkers. No one is pushing them to do anything. They understand this. This could literally be the next Chanel. Yes, the family that owns Chanel also invested in the row, but it literally could be the next Chanel. They're not going to push them in any way, I don't think. From what I know about the, I don't know all the investors really well, but I know a lot about most of their investment philosophies. But I do think that one challenge is like, how do you go, how do you kind of reflect the culture? Because the thing that the row is so good at is like, yeah, I think you sent through, they are doing this platform slide that looks very similar to the Steve Madden slide in the 90s. And I have a, I'm on a text chain with two editors and shoppers who were talking about, should I buy it? It's, it might cut my foot, blah, blah, blah, blah. I personally didn't like them in the 90s. So I'm not going to buy those, but they are very good at like the Teva sand, the black strappy sandal that they did that Teva. I never bought it, but I, every single season, I'm like, should I just get that because I need a sandal that looks elegant. I tried to buy a dupe and it was not good. I have a lot, I mean, all of my shoes are from there. Basically, I have heels of every height, and they just do a really, really good job at making the best version of something that already exists, whether that's like an Ella being boat and tote upgrade, or a pair of of a similar sandal to a Teva sandal. And so I think that's what they're good at. But the thing is they are very tuned into what's happening in the culture. And if the clothes don't reflect that, that could be a challenge for them, not, not like a terrible challenge, but it is something as designers. Like they're, they've, from my reporting, I know they spend a lot more time in Paris than they used to, which is the center of the fashion world. They need to push themselves, I think, design-wise. And that is, that's sort of what I got to in the, in the piece that like, they're not, they could go two ways. One is that they could be an artisanal brand, and one is that they could be a fashion brand. And maybe they'll choose to be an artisanal brand. But I think that they have the intellect and the rigor and the ability to be a real fashion brand, which is what they've been doing the last 10 years. And I think they can take it further. And so this is an interesting moment for them, because they have more power than ever, but they also have the, you know, they need to push themselves more in order to keep at pace with what's happening with, with fashion generally and, and what people want to wear. Yes. And balancing, figuring out the balance between the fashion clothing business and then the shoe and accessory and handbag business. And, you know, what are you most known for? And if the shoes and the handbags start to overtake, well, they probably already have the right to wear. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the interesting thing about that business is that it's very exposed in the U.S. they have, and they have a lot of skews, which stock keeping units for everyone. It just means like, can you explain skew really quickly? And then we should, we should bounce. But, um, yeah, it also feels like nothing ever really goes away with the row, but stock keeping unit each, if you think there's skews and styles and skews are every single style in every colorway and every size gets its own skew number. So the size gets its own skew too. I didn't know that. Yes. Oh, wow. So I mean, different retailers do it different ways, but from what I grew up in my retail career, a style would be a t-shirt and it would be across all styles and colors. That would be that style. And then the skew would be broken down even further into the colorway and the size. I knew the skew was colorway and style, but so, oh, that's interesting. But anyway, they have a lot of skews. They have a lot of styles and they were, they're very heavily in all the department stores and distributed. And then also they don't have that many physical stores. They, so, and the, and a big reason for that is they're very careful about, they want it to be the right space. I personally think they should have a store in downtown New York. I was there, I mean, I'm there every other week, but in January, I was there for a day and had a day to myself. And I went to the day, I went to interview Mickey at Columbia and then I like spent the day shopping downtown and I messaged a friend who knows them. And I said, why don't they have a store in Tribeca or something? Like, I don't want to go up all the way up to the Bresa today. A lot of times I find myself more and more in New York spending most of my time on the Bresa because it's really nice. And I feel really old downtown, but well, Madison Avenue has also had a nice glow up. Yeah, it's lovely up there. And it's just like a lot going on and just feels really comfortable. But I don't, I don't have time to go up there a lot. And so, and this person said, Oh, they just haven't found the race. And I was like, no, I'm sorry. There are a lot of amazing spaces in New York. Do a space downtown like the one of the only stores I go to in LA is on Melrose Place. Like the I go to the row and I go to the railroad and that's like basically in the end scout. And that's basically it. So I think I wonder to if they will start to expand distribution, but it's just an interesting moment because they have more, they have more ability to do more. And they also have the trust and the confidence of their investors. So they could do nothing. But it's like, what do they want to become? And you mentioned that they have a lot of carryover product, which is true too. Right. Anyway, check out my piece on the row. Check out Sarah's piece on Donnie. Check out all of our great stuff at online sheet at puck.news. Every day there's something great. Five days a week. Yes. And I'll catch you soon, Sarah. Thanks for being on. Yeah, great to see you.

There was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll, and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize-winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out. It was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th. Follow and listen on Apple podcasts, the Odyssey app, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcast.",
