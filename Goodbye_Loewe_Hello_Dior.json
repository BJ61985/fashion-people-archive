And I hope to see you in LA in the coming weeks. Carolyn Foe, welcome to Fashion People. Thanks for having me. This is a pleasure and an honor. I'm so excited because I think that you may be a guest on here before you've been a guest on How Long Gone. Is that possible? Oh, yeah, definitely. They'll never have. Why have you and Alex not been on? I don't understand. You two just don't want to do it? No, I don't think it's that. I mean, we've never been asked, first of all. And second, I don't want to ask. You got to come to me. I had this issue with them also where I was like, you've had literally every person on that I know. You've been on. And you haven't had me. You've been on. I was finally. Okay. Because Jason was like, you should come on. Come back on. And I was like, oh, I've never been on. And Chris was like, I just assumed. I was like, no, there's a reason. It's fine. But then I was on and then it didn't work. Then I was on and it didn't work. But then I was on with Sean Tom. Okay. Yes. Whatever. The timing was better anyway. There was the book and, you know, yeah, you're right. Well, I'm glad you're, you've agreed to be on fashion people since you are a fashion person and maybe not a coastal elite in the same way as your husband. I am more of a coastal elite than Jason is, you know? You're right. You're right. So there is a lot of news today. One thing really quickly I wanted to bring up for the loyal listeners is that last week when Mel Atenberg was on and we were doing a fashion month wrap up, I accidentally, we were talking about all the like new show, the debut shows. And we were like, I kept saying, I know there was a third one. I know there was a third one. And Mel was like, nah, there were just two. But there was a third one. So it was Julianne Dre's fan note and that we forgot to discuss. What did you think of that show? Yeah. I think I liked it. I don't know. I need a moment to digest, I think. I, yeah. I think also the way that I look at shows, like it's, I really need to understand like what the project would be for that I would use it for. Otherwise I'm just kind of, it's my personal opinion. And, you know, I don't know. I don't like very many things though, I think. And the way that I, when I say that it's like, could I see myself wearing this? That's like what I'm thinking for myself. How closely do you look at the shows right after or during that month? Or do you wait until you're working on something that you need to pull from a particular season and then do you scan? It depends. There's certain brands that I'm always like excited about. I'm like, okay, what do they do now? And then, but mostly like, because there's so many shows, right? Like I feel like I usually just wait till there's an editorial, which I'm actually in one right now, I'm prepping for one. So this is like kind of good timing, you know, like I'm pulling all the fall stuff. So yeah, I'm pretty up to date on it right now. What did you love from this past season? I mean, Tom Ford, you know, I thought that was really exciting and that was really cool and it felt really buzzy. People wanted to talk about it. I've also always liked Hydrocrum. I always think, you know, I always thought he was really talented. What else did I like? I guess Mew Mew. Yeah, I mean, I thought that was interesting. Like I always like Mew Mew, though, you know, I mean, at least for the past few seasons, it's such like a hot thing. Oh, and Calvin, Calvin. Is that like an easy answer? Just because, you know, you know, you bring it up, you bring these two up in particular. And what I thought both collections did was sort of present something that felt very like the way young people actually dress. And especially Mew Mew, I went to Squirrel yesterday. I got back on Saturday. Of course, Sunday, we went to Squirrel for a family meal. And first of all, that has become a young girl's brunch date spot. Wait, how do you mean? So it's like for a while. So pre-pandemic, obviously, it was just like every single person we've ever met went to Squirrel all the time and you run into people. And then pandemic, they obviously had anyone could just like Google Squirrel and Jam. I don't want to get into it. We're all big supporters of Jessica Coslow here and love her. She's she's the Alice Water of our generation. So but you can look up. They had a little scandal situation. And then and so I wouldn't say the business died down, but the line changed. It was just like the line wasn't as long and then also courage bagels open down their street. So I mean, honestly, Jason and I couldn't have been happier when that happened because we were like, finally, we can go to Squirrel in peace. Yes, agreed. And it was just it was just easy. It everything got a little easier and you tell they were doing really a lot of business with delivery. So I'm like, fine, lazy people get your food delivered. It takes like an hour and a half. Good for you. And we can enjoy our life. But this this time we went, we got there, I think, like right at noon or maybe right at 1130. I don't remember. But the line was pretty long and it was it had aged down significantly. So it was all like 25 year old girls, all of them on like friend dates. So tons of groups of young girls, which was interesting. And a lot of them were like pretty dorky. I felt like these are the kind of these are the girls I was friends with when I was 22 years old. I not as cool as you, Carolyn, but like really sweet. That's really sweet. But like, but they all the funny thing was you mentioned you, Mew. I took a couple of photos and sent them to Leandra Medina, Becky Malinsky, who I'm on like a fashion text chain with. It they looked like they they looked at the Mew Mew show and they tried outfits on. They were all wearing skirts, a lot of them wearing high boots, mixed colors, lavender, purple. It was they and they were green like a green one girl was so cool. She had cowboy boots on a black lace slip, a cool like band T shirt. Wait, I love this. Yes. Yes. Okay. So it's a cute little scene. Yeah. Yeah, it's a great scene. I I love this. I was very excited for them all to like live their lives and talk about their relationships around me as I was with my child and husband. Okay. Do you think they are visiting? Like, do you think these are little girlies coming up from Orange County or do you think these are people who move to LA live in Silver Lake? They're doing they're like working at Trader Joe's or something or a vintage shop live in the dream. Yes. I think they live in Glassel Park, though, or Lincoln Heights. Okay. And not Silver Lake anymore because they can't afford it. I mean, unless mommy and daddy are paying, I like that narrative too. It's true. There were two girls who were I'll send you the photo. Like the one had on Leopard print ballet flats with white socks. Like these girls definitely follow you on Instagram is what I would say. Well, I mean, I'm flattered by that. Oh, all right. What do you think of Los Angeles style post pandemic and how it's changed? I mean, I don't think it's really changed that much. I feel like this is a thing with LA. People always say, oh, LA has such bad style. It's not as cool as New York and like really, like, honestly, that's such a fucking boring statement to me. Wait, am I allowed to say that? Yes. OK, great. It's such a boring statement. I think it's like, you know, there's obviously like pockets of really cool, chic people that get it, that are world travelers. They've seen it all, you know, and they have like such cool personal style and perspective. And then there's going to be groups of people that are just like trend chasers or like, you know, it's just fashion isn't really their thing. Or they just love wearing sweatpants and alo sets. Like that exists in New York. That exists everywhere, even when I went to Paris, I was seeing that. So I don't think, you know, well, maybe we're viewing from the question now. Post pandemic fashion. I think it's always been kind of the same. I've not really noticed a difference. It feels to me like it's very all over the place. But the thing is I didn't live here pre pandemic. OK, when I would come here, it would be very concentrated. I would say if you want to see good clothes, I mean, squirrel on Sunday at 1145 a.m. was definitely a place. Bar is it Baro Santos, that restaurant in Glassel Park that's owned by the same people that own found oyster? Is that what it's called? Found Oyster has Queen Street. And but Baro Santo is like, what is that? It's like a Portuguese spot. Yeah, they own that too. Oh, they do. Oh, OK. I didn't realize. Yeah, I'm a big fan. That place, I feel like if you want to see amazing fashion, that's where you go in LA. Interesting. OK, yeah, I've not really noticed it. I've been there a couple of times. I've not noticed, but, you know, the vibe has always been good. It is so good. Yeah. So so back to Paris this morning, there was a big announcement that we have all been waiting for. That Jonathan Anderson is leaving Loewe. Right. After months of speculation. Right. What do you think? Are you what was your kind of relationship to his Loewe? I mean, I like him as a designer. I think the clothes are very interesting for editorial. I've never purchased any pieces for myself. Not just I don't like it. I just think that I dress a very specific way and Loewe is not that way. But yeah, I'm happy for him. I feel like, you know, he's been there what, like 10, 11 years. I would want to change too, I guess. That's a decade, you know, and he's going where now? Where did they say they haven't said but he's going to Dior? Right. OK. I can't see. That makes so much sense to me. I mean, like just the architecture of what he was doing, like in terms of the garments, the architecture of the garments at Loewe, I feel like that translated to Dior will be really beautiful and really interesting. Yeah, I agree. I think, look, there are a lot of people I've talked to pretty much every person I spoke with in Paris over the last two weeks. We discussed this situation and some people were like, he was so good at Loewe. I mean, he turned that into nothing, into a real something and a significant business for that company. I think it's two billion dollars now or when he's I mean, it was probably like 200 million or something small, really small, maybe a little bigger because they just have so much distribution, but made it into a two billion dollar business and he has so many ideas. And the thing about him, just from I have been writing about him and reporting on him as a, you know, as a business person, he owns his own company, but also as a creative director since I think the first time I did a story on him was 2011. So have seen it was it was before he was doing women's even with his line. I went to his studio in East London and what I would say is this is a person who has like unlimited ambition and also really tries to push himself mentally and creatively in a way that I'm not sure anyone else of his generation is capable. And so as much as like he was really great at Loewe and could do 10 more years and it would be interesting and he really pushed he changed the narrative there about halfway through the tenure into something much more conceptual. But I would say and there is, you know, I don't want to say reticence, but like a little bit of worry about him going to somewhere like you are and running men's and women's, which no one has ever done. It's always been one designer for each and it's already a $10 billion company and they want to push it to a $14 billion company. And he's I don't want to say a niche designer, but a designer who has specific tastes. And so how do you apply that? But I think the reality is that you're exactly right. You and I should want to go and spend money on a bar jacket. I mean, we could get them vintage and that's what most people will do. But we should want to buy one. And I think that's what is and also the accessories and handbags like, yes, you have to have the Lady Dior and they just launched this new bag that honestly, I don't remember the name of it. I'd not it's not I'm not a fan of it, but I like the Lady Dior. But like make it into something that I want that. And I think he'll be able to do that. I agree. I mean, he he has he knows what's happening. Like, I feel like just, you know, Greta Lee wearing the way all the time. Like he just senses like the right people and the right vibe to kind of bring to the brand. And I feel like that I mean, that's like a different thing than design, but like equally important, you know, because I feel like what's the vibe at the fashion show? Like who are the people that are here who's wearing you on the red carpet? Like a lot of that does play so much into the influence of a brand. Yeah. Yes, for sure. It's his his ability to be a part of culture is. He really understands it's very millennial. He's he really understands commercial culture. Did you like him as a costume designer on Challengers? I loved it. Yeah, me too. Me too. I want him to do more of that. Yeah, I'm same. And I think he did queer also, which I went to see and I actually interviewed him about it. And that was all sourced pieces, nothing designed, nothing new, which was great. It was amazing. But I would say that like I could see you your personal style and your approach as a stylist, like really vibing with a lot of the way he approached it. Like it was just I thought the mix of brands and I talked to him about this, like how they mix Nike and Adidas and Uniqlo and the fact that they figured out how to get away with that is amazing enough. But he just like that pair of plaid shorts that totally, you know, I bought them for for Dan from her. I don't think he's a damn. I mean, I don't think he's ever worn them. It's fine. He'll figure it out. You know, maybe he just needs like a little suggestion here or there. Yeah. Yeah. Do you wear any vintage? Do you or are you more just Chanel? I mean, I love vintage Chanel. I like new Chanel. I'm literally the last person on earth. I think that likes new Chanel stuff. Not true. Not true. OK. Yeah. I don't really, you know, the things that I collect vintage, it's Tom Ford Gucci. It's Chanel. It's some Galliano. If I can afford it, you know, it's like getting so expensive now. It's crazy. But yeah, I don't really nothing outside of that. Interesting. Yeah, I just got a Tom Ford, Saint Laurent dress. Oh, I'm going to I'll show it to you. Where did you find her? You know, it was actually speaking of Melottenberg. It was his curation on the selects on the real, real when he did a collab with them. Wait, how did I miss that? Oh, it was so good. They did not do a great job of promoting it. No offense to the real, real much love. But like it was not exactly right the way that they positioned it. I did a lot of promotion of it because I thought it was so good. I think I think they should do it again because everything was like under 500 bucks. I think. Oh, really good stuff. Yeah, I'm sorry to miss that. Such a big fan of Mel. This show is brought to you by Boca. Boca knows that when you take care of your mouth, your whole body benefits.

The Loewe announcement was just and there will be more announcements because they're going to announce the new designer designers there. And the next couple of weeks, Proenza, the school or founders. Right. Right. Jack McCall and Lazaros Hernandez, but then, and then obviously Jonathan to Dior will, will happen probably after that. But last week there were tons of announcements. There was endless. Yes. Yes. There was the Simone Balate to from Bali to Jill Sandor. Yeah. Then there was Oh, Versace, Dario Vettale, Versace. And then there was Damna de Gucci. And the only the only, well, I guess the Bali spot is open, but there are questions of what they're going to do with it from now on. But the only open spot is Balenciaga. And I don't think because Damna is working there for the next six months on couture and then they'll do couture, I think, in May or June. I think probably earlier than the rest of couture. But don't don't quote me on that, but I have a feeling. But he starts at Gucci in July. So I have a feeling they'll wait until he's done to announce the next person if they can. And I was just curious who you would like to see a Balenciaga. Well, OK. I don't know if this is controversial or not, but. John Galliano at Balenciaga. I mean, that could be like the comeback of all comebacks. You're a big John Galliano fan. I am. I mean, like, OK, I understand that, you know, he fucked up. He said some things. Yeah. Some things. He's repented for it, I think he's like stayed, you know, kind of low key for a while. But if you just look at it like the early shows, like it was so gorgeous. It's so beautiful. It's so theatrical. And I think Demna at Balenciaga, similarly, like very theatrical. So that to me is very interesting. I've also heard rumor about Martine Rose. Is that? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm less excited about that. Yeah. Someone damned me about that. I think, look, I think Martine is incredibly talented. And there is this. There's this challenge in the business where it's all white men who get these jobs. Usually gay white men, not that that is even. I mean, that gives you a little bit of diversity, I guess. But in fashion, it's the opposite. Like it's like it's like a group of men who all know each other and they all get these jobs. And I think when someone's, which is why it was exciting that Louise Trotter was appointed at Bottega Veneta, who is a person with a lot of experience, who isn't a white gay man and is being given the opportunity to run a very big house with a lot of commercial potential in front of it. I would say with Martine, look, she worked with Demna. I think she's incredibly, incredibly talented. I don't think what they need is and it's not that she would do a continuation, but it what they need is something in the same universe as what he did. I think they need something totally different. And so, I find those narratives like challenging because, yes, it's cool. It would be cool. But it's like it's kind of like when are you going to just vote for a woman because she's a woman? It's a similar thing. And I think in this case, like a lot of times these people are appointed and it's not good for their careers either. Like it should be the right that when she was being when she was in the conversation about Louis Vuitton, that was more exciting to me. Like it just was it just made a little more sense. John Galliano look like I'm not. I agree that like the the the circumstances in which he was taken down and scandalized or first of all, that happened over a decade ago. Second of all, I'm not sure. I don't think I I really enjoyed the documentary that on him like about a year and a half ago that came out. Yes, I loved that. I thought it was really good. I'm not sure it made him seem totally innocent or or totally in the clear. But like people are human and I agree. It's not it's not about that for me. I would say. Yeah. I think in that documentary, it was very apparent that he was just in a bad place. You know, I think there was maybe alcohol, maybe drugs, maybe a combination of both. And he was just not well. Yeah. And I think in the documentary, like his whatever current day, he he he recognizes that, you know, it's he's not hiding from it by any means. Yeah. So yeah, he's not he's not a perfect person, regardless. But also, should that mean does that mean he should not never work again? That's not up for me to decide. I think the bigger thing for me with him is like. I don't think what he does is connected to reality in any way. And that's fine. And it was fine at Margella because they had a base of they had a merchandising base of product that like from from Margella and and merchandise out of what he did. That it's funny that Margella was thought of as like so conceptual, but ended up being like a really commercial designer that whose ideas lasted forever. Like his Hermes Margella, someone I was just talking to was saying it was so sort of, I don't know, was reviled, but like really not looked like looked down upon when it came out. And now it's like all we wear is Martin Margella Hermes knock off so or or from the real real like I have, you know, but so so it's interesting. But it and they did a really good job at merchandising around Galiano to make that last tour show work. And I don't know if there's enough, enough of an infrastructure at Bilencia and Bilencia is too big of a bit. I think they need something where the fashion proposition translates to the store. And that is where I'm not sure he would be. He would be the right person. I mean, the ones that have come up for me are Peter, Mueller, Mueller. I don't know how to pronounce it. And I probably never will. Let's go back. Yeah, I mean, I'm sure if I asked him, I would not remember like five five minutes later, but from who's a liar. I think he's tremendously talented and he can totally do it. And it would be awesome. That said, like I love his Aliyah and I want him to do more there. The other person that came up recently that seems farfetched, but could be interesting as Ralph Simmons, but like who and maybe he doesn't do Prada anymore. Maybe he does this. I hope that's not, I hope that's just like Internet blabber. But I thought both of those were would be exciting. The other one that people have mentioned is Ricardo Tishi, but I don't know. That's a guy who like literally I've been hearing rumors about him since 2009. What is he up to? Nothing. And he needs a, he needs a job I've heard. Like he hasn't worked since what was it? Givenchy? Since Burberry. Burberry. Never forget. Oh, but it's interesting because I don't know. I think like it makes sense. He cleared his Instagram account the day before all this went down. And which is kind of like, are you just trolling or are you engaged? Did you detective this stuff? Did you like see it yourself? No, someone sent it to me. Okay. Okay. It's like actually multiple people. There was a particular group of people who was who, who had, who noticed it. And they were all like talking about it. But I mean, I don't know. It might not be any of them. I don't think the person, I think the person's probably set, but it may be they're still working out the details. Sure. I mean, you would know more than anyone. You're in it. I will, I will find out. Don't worry. I'll know for sure. Right now I really don't know. And, and my. Who do you want? Like who's your, who's your pick? I don't know because I really, part of me is like, yes, Peter, because I know Peter would do an amazing job and I'm a massive, massive fan, but I love him at Eliya and I also think Rich Ma really needs him. Eliya's business is doing incredibly well. And it's, I don't want to say it's carrying the fashion group, but it's, it's become like integral to that very tiny fashion group. And if they want to keep doing fashion, it's, to me, the success of the lion, the early successes at Chloe with Chimina showed that like being a smaller brand, but having, having a mix of like a really strong runway and some key commercial pieces, that's what consumers want now. Like they, you're not going to wear anything that's on the runway, but you go to the store and you buy a really cool dress or you buy Mary Jane's or you buy what have you and you buy the flats, you buy the back. Yeah. Exactly. And they've proven that that's so possible. Um, so part of me is like, and I really just love the team. I think Miriam, his CEO is really cool. She's like the chicest woman ever. Not that that matters, but it does in some ways. And I think she's just, she's really good. There's a, there's a few rising star CEOs, Pascal at Loewe, Severina, Celine that I am just interested in. And I think Miriam is, is part of that crew. And so part of me is like, no, I don't want him to go. I, I do think, I mean, look, I'm trying to think of a young person who hasn't gotten a shot yet, who would be really good. But do you think Balenciaga would, you know, take that chance? Well, look, it's, it's a decent sized business. A lot of the businesses, accessories, I think they have the way that caring is set up, caring breaks out numbers for Bottega Veneta, Salarant and Gucci. They don't break out numbers for Balenciaga yet. It's, it's kind of in the, in a group with Alexander McQueen and a couple other small, Breone, some smaller brands. And so you have a little more room and also like the motorcycle bag is doing really well. It's really strong. There's a lot that sneaker. Those sneakers might not be like the thing now, but they will be again in 10 years. Like sneakers and shoes and joints. I have a question about that motorcycle bag. Is it actually, are they actually selling numbers or have they just gifted that bag to every single person we know? They're selling it. Okay. They are. But yes, I'm sure that is a big part of it too, in terms of why we see it. The thing I would say is my understanding about that, the accessories business generally is that a lot of that business is done in Asia and not just China, but in Korea also. And also, you know, South America, places that like we, I always get this question about Jack-O-Mousse because it's a big business and people are like, who wears it? Who, who do you? Everybody wears it. Yeah. And also the bags are like pretty affordable and in Asia, business is huge. So I think that like a lot of that kind of business happens outside of and also in Europe where people spend money on clothes and accessories and things. I think like in America, if you're going to spend money on something like that, you're probably going to buy Hermes or Louis Vuitton or what have you unless you're like really into fashion, which most people aren't. Like the majority of people. But then there are, you know, the people that we see, a lot of those women are buying either sample sale bags or they're buying secondhand. So you, I mean, you see like beat up motorcycle bags everywhere right now. And I do think that that benefits them in some ways. It's a challenge because like girls who would save up for a motorcycle bag previously, maybe are just buying secondhand. But on the other hand, like people with the means might see a cool girl with a motorcycle bag and just think, oh, well, I'm not going to waste my time trying to find the right one on the real, real, but I'll instead just buy it full price. So yes, I do think, I do think that that business has improved for them because it just was a, it's like a trend cycle thing. I heard recently that Isabel Marat, the wedge sneakers are doing well again. After like 10 years, they were huge for 10 years and they were huge out in like tertiary areas. And then they went and they were like death and now they're back. So it's like this stuff always comes back. I fully forgot about Isabel Marat for at least like 10 years. And just this last season, I was looking just cause I don't know, I was an advertiser that I had to look at for this editorial and I'm a big fan. It's really good. It's so back. Yeah. It's so bad. It's like that whole indie sleaze era and suddenly I'm here for it like that and Chloe. I never really cared about Chloe. Very, very into it right now, both brands. Yeah. Yeah. It was so funny in Paris. I noticed that like every single guy was wearing a Marant baseball cap. I don't know about that. It's, well, it's not cool guys. But it's like every single, a lot of guys at fashion shows who none, I mean, who's cool, who works in fashion, no one. But it was really interesting. And then I posted about it and someone messaged me, sorry, I just got a new order from Chanel. Oh, it's just lipstick recommended by Marissa Meltzer. The interesting thing was, so I posted a photo of a guy and I covered his face being like, I've seen so many guys with this hat on and someone messaged me who's a professor at FIT and said, all the kids there wear Marant sweatshirts and Marant baseball caps because it's part of being quote unquote preppy, which Sarah Shapiro who writes to two days of line chain and our retail correspondent and ex buyer, like really expert on this stuff. And also as an 11 year old daughter said, did you know they're like the definition of preppy has changed? Okay, but like how is that preppy? I don't know. It's not preppy. It's not preppy. But the thing is they've completely divorced the word preppy from its original meaning. It has nothing. It's not connected in any way to prep school attire or anything that's like related to that sort of culture. It doesn't mean anything. It's just like they say, I want to dress preppy and the way they, when you look and see what they think is quote unquote preppy, it makes, it doesn't make any sense. It's like the word completely lost any meaning. I wonder, you know what I wonder what David Marx thinks about this. I bet he could write about 4,000 words on why this is, because I've, I've messaged him previously and been like David, I probably five years ago or even seven. The, when the rowing blazer stuff was really big. Yeah. I messaged him and I was like, and Noah was kind of seeping into the culture and everybody was copying Noah. I was like, I think preppy is becoming like in fashion again. And he like really disagreed that it could be fashion. He was like, it's not a trend. It's just a way of being. And I was like, yes, but it is both. And now it's become like completely, it has nothing to do with the original concept of it and is now just a word that is used on TikTok to describe a collection of clothing that has nothing to do with what we know as preppy culture. It's extremely weird. Okay. I need to dig into this because it's making me feel old that I don't. And maybe the new definition of preppy from what you're describing by like an Isabel Morant's sweatshirt is just like clean cut. I honestly don't know. Is that? But okay. I'll look into it. The thing I would say is that if this, oh, in a new AI overview, in a new geno, if a lead definition, preppy refers to a bright girly aesthetic characterized by pink, smiley faces, ribbons and trendy, often oversized clothing with a focus on popular name brands like Lululemon and Stanley. So it's basically basic B. But what I would say is- Wait, I hate that. It's, I don't like it. It's really, it makes me, it makes me upset. But what I would say is- It's aligned with fall y'all type of go. Yes. And it's like, love shack fancy vibe. I'm not- Got it. The whole thing is very stressful. What I would say is- Stressful is a good word. I am happy for Isabel Morant that who cares how they're making all this money? Sure. The fact that they have gotten to a point because when, you're younger than me, but when I was in my late 20s, Isabel Morant was only starting to be distributed in the U.S. and I would go to Bird on Smith Street and get like one thing on sale. And it was a very much a thing of only French cool girls wore this brand, Manuel Alt. And if you want to look like that, you wear it. And then it, the wedge sneaker made it much bigger with like more fashion consumers. And it still kind of kept that thing like it's still cool girl, French girl, the clothes are amazing. But if it can become a name brand because of these sweatshirts and hood, these and hats, like good for Isabel Morant, because that is finally the sort of export of French cool girl style becomes like, let's make it a billion dollar business. Good for them. Sure. Listen, I love the buck. I love it. Yeah, we love it. I support that. I support it. I'm an American at the end of the day. Speaking of making a buck, last week when I was in Paris, another journalist said to me, you know, French people don't like rich people because I was trying to understand the way the French people look at a Bernard Arnaud, who is the richest man in the world on a good day versus the way Americans look at some of our billionaires. And here, you know, if, if you act badly, you do end up getting a bad rep. But generally people love rich people and they want to be rich. They see them as, you know, examples of how to live or whatever. And last week, Mr. Arnaud, who is the CEO and chairman of LVMH, the 75 company conglomerate that he owns and has owned since 1988, he proposed, he, he sent the government journal released a memo saying that on, I think it's April 17th at the LVMH shareholders meeting, Arnaud and the board would propose that he be able to stay CEO and chair until 85 years old. He's 76. So nine more years. I mean, I gotta say, it's very Logan Roy of him. So Logan Roy, but, except for this company is like, yeah, it's very American. It's, it's the, except for the fact that this company is like very successful and Waste Our Royco was, was challenged. But the reality is, who else can run a 75 company business like conglomerate? If he's still kicking, if the brain is still working, like, why not? I agree. I agree. I don't think any of those kids want that job right now. Maybe they want it in 10 years. I don't know if any of them will actually ever get it. I could see a situation where a couple of the kids run the business together. I could see a situation where the company eventually breaks up into smaller companies, probably not. But I think there are a lot of investors who think that that would be a better way to do it. But yeah, all that being said, like, if he, if he's able, I don't, he's the, like, he's not the founder, but he's the founder. He, he is the founder of the business that exists now. He might not be the founder of LVMH specifically, but he created what is there. And I just don't think there's anyone else. There's definitely no one else with the amount of knowledge, but also, um, let, feeling good, the minute people stop working, things go down. I agree. I agree. He's got to stay busy. Each spring, 23 Pulitzer Prizes are awarded for Distinguished Journalism, Books, Drama, and Music. There was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll, and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out it was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th. Follow and listen on Apple podcasts, the Odyssey app, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcast.

I wanted to ask you really quickly because we need to talk about your book too. Did you see this latest Taylor and Travis? The Del Frisco date? Yeah, Del Frisco's. I don't know if I remember that. Have you ever been there? I have not. Like to me, okay, just the name alone. Who goes there? I don't know. It reads like, is this like a red lobster? Like, what's the vibe? It's supposed to be a fancy steakhouse yet. I don't know. The name is giving chain. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe I think David Cho told me that he like, low key kind of likes it there. Well, this is the thing I was going to say. Should we ask Alison Roman if it is? Yeah, I just feel like let's see if she responds immediately. Do you like? She's a Keens girlie. Yeah, exactly. Like Keens is, I feel like more, if you want old school things. Yeah, it's like more charming or something. To me, Peter Luger is extremely overrated. Don't at me. I'm sorry. I haven't been there in a long time, but I really didn't. Yes, Del Frisco is definitely a chain. I just think it's a weird, it was, it's a weird choice. Like I get them going to all those other places that are, I like Chaney, I like chains. I love, love a Houston's moment, but it just seems weird. I agree. But at the same time, like, you know, Travis, Kelsey, Taylor Swift, like it all makes sense. Yeah. It's, it's sure. I agree with you. Like right off the bat, I was like, Del Frisco, that's weird. But of all the places too, to go to, that's where you went. But at the same time, I'm like, this makes sense for that. You know, like she can get a little salmon, he can get a little baby back rib or a steak or, you know, one on the cob mashed potatoes, whatever. The looks though, I have to say, this is like probably the most normal I've ever seen them dress. Yes, I thought it's, it's hard to really see. I did wonder if she had on pantyhose, skin color. I guess she can't say nude anymore. But it looks like she might have on nude pantyhose. Like a, like a cabaret dancer. Yeah. Which like, maybe not. It's probably just that it's blurry. Yeah. That would be absolutely insane. I guess you would call them skin color, not nude. Skin color. Yeah. Yeah. That would be absolutely mental and kind of amazing. I, okay, my thought when seeing that, I feel like she's wearing like an Eritzia corporate core blazer mini skirt set, which honestly, like anything better than what she's normally wearing. I can't, it like hurts my eyes to look at that. Yeah. I didn't mind it either. I thought it, I thought that the jacket was nice. Yeah. Fine. My, my main issue with him right now is the hair. Yeah. What is the hair? I don't know. I think it's an implant. I think he got implants. No. Yeah. No way. Yes. Because here is the thing, which I am pro look, like if you need your hair, get, get hair implants. Like I, I understand. I'm, I don't, I'm not judging that, but there is something that happened. But forget who explained this to me. Someone explained that like, when guys do, when they get the hair implants, they have, it's like pretty long because they graft it. They graft the hair from another part of their body. Yeah. That would be absolutely wild. It's just so bad. Whatever it is, he needs to fix it. Yeah. Okay. But do you think this is just like post season blues? Like, you know, when actors like finish a film or a press tour, they can just let themselves go. They didn't win. This is them in mourning, not wearing, cause they're usually in like red and yellow. Yeah. Crazy colors. I don't know. I think he looked way better like a year ago. So I'm a little concerned. I just think he, yeah. I mean, he's, I think like his face and I'm just looking at his hair, his buzz cut. He has a lot of hair. So I don't know if he would need to do the. Yeah. I never thought of him as like a guy that was losing his hair. It's just a weird haircut. Like, I don't, it, it doesn't make any sense. It's upsetting to me. Personally. Yeah. I don't, I don't know. Like these two people, I just like can't, I can't look at them like all due respect to the, I like her music enough. I think he's a great football player. Sure. I don't know anything about football. I just like the streets. I already is really good. I hear he's not that. I think he's, what is his, is he a tight end? Travis, I think he is what I think he's the best tight end. I in like to ever play or something like that. Yeah. He's the tight. He's potentially the best tight end to ever play. Cause those words were slipped into my copy once and I was like, you need to remove this cause I don't know what it means. Yeah. Sports isn't really my thing, but sure. You know, like I guess, I don't know. I don't get the appeal actually. I don't at all. Never have. It's just not in my wheelhouse. No, I agree. I mean, neither, someone said to me, the brothers, I don't, I'm not interested in you. No, no, no, I mean, like to be honest with, like, I know there's a lot of like sports people going into fashion now and again, people are going to hate me saying this, but like it's just so over the top. It's so tacky. It's, I don't, I don't get it. It's not tasteful. Yeah. And it doesn't feel like personal style either. You know, it just kind of feels like who can be the loudest. It's interesting. I just did something on Russell Westbrook is going to start a, it started newsletter. It comes out, I think the first time on Wednesday. So this is running March 18th. I think it comes out March 19th and Russell is like really into fashion. He's cares about fashion. He's interested in fashion. He's probably like the first basketball player to be like super into Tom Brown. And, and that I think is interesting. And I, and I, I like it. I think it's, if you're going to have a famous person on, in your campaign, having an athlete who has like accomplished something is kind of interesting. But I think you're right in that. It's, it does feel really forced in many cases and in a, what I think is challenging is you see this on the red carpet a lot with men and women, but the, the brands don't know how to dress people with muscular bodies. No. So they just look weird. Like it's either, I think the Tom Brown stuff that's really tight is kind of on purpose and that's fun. Like when I super muscly guys wearing like a really tight Tom Brown suit, I can like appreciate that in, in one particular, but you can just see it, especially with the women, like the garments aren't tailored properly because they're, they're not used to like really like athletic bodies or whatever. So it does feel like a lot of it is, is sort of a cop out or, or just like an, they think, oh, these people, this person has a huge reach. Why don't I try to like capitalize that on that or whatever. Exactly. I mean, to me, you know, it's, listen, and I understand too, like every body type, especially if you're an athlete, like you might be more broad in certain places. And it's, it can be difficult to dress that or like find the right silhouette that's fluttery, you know, so I understand that it's difficult, but I do completely agree with you. I think sometimes they're just like, here, throw this on. We'll just, you know, take up the hem and it's, it just needs so much more than that. Yes, totally. I think that what could be interesting for you is to start a business where you become a stylist to athletes. I don't like doing personal styling. I mean, I know it's weird. I'm a stylist that lives in LA. I don't really do that. I just, it's very difficult. It's a lot of, let's call it a psychology. I don't know. I just don't, that's like a whole different job to me. It is a whole different job. And, and it is interesting. I have a couple of friends who are stylists, including you and Rebecca Ramsey, who does style some individuals, but she's kind of found her niche is she does Miranda July and she did Sean Baker, the director of Enora and kind of these like sort of East side, I mean, Sean lives in New York, but you know what I mean, like East side creatives who also need to be red carpet ready. And so that's been an interesting path for her because it does just seem like such a, such an ordeal. But the interesting thing about you is you grew up here and you ended up doing editorial and commercial styling. And you just this book that you were going to come on in December and we had scheduling conflicts, but you just released this book with your friend who's a photographer. And it is tell us about motivations and what that sort of represents in terms of the kind of work that you do. So, yeah, I mean, I'll talk about the book first. We kind of, Ian is a friend of mine and we collaborate a lot on just like random things. We've been shooting just personal projects for forever together. But yeah, this just kind of came about and we were texting back and forth, he and I were both traveling between LA and New York and we would just send each other photos of like, oh my God, look at this crazy street style. He would, you know, whatever, random people were like, oh my God, this is amazing. This is amazing. And then we just thought of, you know, why don't we do a story on these like characters that we've discovered and like a riff on that. And it's like kind of our interpretation of, you know, like the most interesting people in LA, the most interesting people in New York, and let's just put them all in a room. And so our friend, Karo, who did the makeup and our friend Dennis, who did the hair and these insane wigs, we basically just took, you know, I don't know how many models like five or six models and transformed them into different characters, like to see how far we could direct them in one direction or another by way of clothes, hair and makeup, blah, blah, blah. And yeah, let's just see where we land. And so there was no intention of making a book at all. It was just like, let's take a bunch of fun pictures and we just couldn't stop. We just like kept doing it. And then we had so many photos and Ian and I looked at each other and we're like, Oh, this is kind of cool. Like, yeah, maybe we put this out in a little bit. And interestingly enough, a magazine had reached out to me and wanting to do a very similar project. And I was like, Oh, I actually just shot this thing with my friend and they looked at it and they were like, Oh, cool, like maybe you could do this for us. And we were in conversation with them and going back and forth and like logistically, we just realized to do this again would take at least minimum two weeks of our time and so much more money. And we were like, wait, why don't we just take that money and that time and publish our own thing. And so that's what we did. That's kind of how it came about. And yeah, it's been really fun. You know, I've made like little projects here and there. I used to do zines a lot back in the day, like as a yearly recap of my work and send it out to clients. And so it was fun to kind of dip back into that, but in a different way. And yeah, it's cool, you know, like you get to select your own images. And like, I rarely get to be a part of the edit. And I don't know, just like lay it out exactly how we want it design exactly how we want it and have a little party. And it was great. So fun. Would you ever want to do a magazine like a biannual? I would, you know, I would. I think I would want to work inside of a magazine for a little bit first to really see like the inner workings of it from a on like a day to day basis, because I think what I know of magazines is very much on the other side. It's like, you know, they contact me and I do the thing. And then I'm kind of like in and out more or less. So yeah, I'd like to go in house first and before starting my own. I think that would just make me feel a bit more confident. And I'm sure I would just like, you know, lose a lot less money doing it that way, just like knowing where where to spend money and where to not. You know, but yeah, I'd love to maybe one day, maybe one day. Yeah, let's see. I love diversifying my assets, Lauren. I really want to like do it all. I mean, if you can figure out how to run a magazine with like three people, it could be really profitable. Carolyn, this was so fun. You have to come back. I would love to. This was really fun. I felt like I feel like we were just, you know, at dinner gossiping, chatting. So good. Well, we'll do it again soon. I appreciate it. I love to do it.
