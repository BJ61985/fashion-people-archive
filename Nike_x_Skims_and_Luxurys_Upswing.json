Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Puck's Fashion and Beauty memo, line sheet. And today with me on the show is Bernstein analyst, Lukasoka. It's earning season. So we're talking about LVMH's portfolio pruning, Caring's Gucci problem, Hermes' working strategy, and plenty more. Happy Tuesday, everyone. I hope you're having a good break between the shows which start up again at the end of the week in London. I am currently in Los Angeles where celebrity styling season is in full swing. Yes, their award shows too, but it's really about the close people. Tons of people went to London for the BAFTAs. Then this weekend were the WGAs, the SNL 50th special. And then in like a week and a half for the Milana Parish shows, and the Oscars fall right between them. What terrible timing for everyone involved. This week on line sheet, I broke some news about a collaboration between Nike and Skims. It's going to be huge. Expect to hear a lot more about it throughout the week. I also explained what's going on with Saks Global, who CEO Mark Metrix sent a note to brands last week saying a bunch of stuff. And a lot of people are upset. So I talked to Mark about it. I talked to a bunch of brands about it. So I wrote about that. If you're a customer also and you've been waiting on a refund from Saks, I explain what's happening. You will get your refund. It's going to take a while. And I hope to explain why. Rachel Strugeatz also made a special Monday appearance to give the latest update on what's happening with Drew Elliott's exit from Mac Cosmetics. So there's so much going on. Luca Sokka, welcome back to Fashion People. Thank you very much indeed, Lauren. Thank you for having me. One of my favorite guests. So you've been very busy the last few weeks. Yes, indeed. There's been quite a lot of companies reporting and there was a lot of excitement for the sector. There's a cyclical rebound in the making. So lots of investors wanting to discuss it. So when do you think the rebound will actually be? Do you think end of 2025 things will start picking up? Well, I think that from what we've seen so far, the worst was probably the third quarter of 24. And we've seen an incremental improvement in the fourth quarter with very broad based contribution from different nationalities, the Americans, the Europeans. They were all up relative to what we had seen recently. And even the Chinese, while staying on the back foot, were better than in the third quarter. It's not clear when it comes to the Chinese, whether it was the third quarter that was impacted by Daigo's pausing. And as the Japanese, and appreciate it, but there seems to be a sense that the first quarter of this year is continuing on the same trend. So we seem to be out of the woods. So on China in particular, I noticed that Moncler, which had pretty good results or great results, I think you use the word smash whenever you use that word, I pay attention, but that they did particularly well in China. Can you explain why and do you think their success there is separate from all this or reflective of what is about to happen there? I think that that they've clearly done a very good job in becoming relevant to Chinese consumers. The Shanghai Genius event definitely helped most recently, but they had been building the brand for quite a long time. The Chinese also have a love affair with the outdoors and Moncler resonates with that quite well. And so, you know, when I would say there's a general rule, when consumers watch their pennies and cut their shopping lists, you need to be at the top of their preferences so that you stay on the shopping list. And I think that Moncler is one of those brands that have managed to do so. Do you think it also has to do with the fact that it was just a lot snowier and colder and rainier in a big part of the world? I mean, especially in Europe and on the East Coast of the US this year, it was much snowier than it has been in quite a few years. I think that, you know, the truth is that winter comes every year. Sooner or later, we have that. And I think that while in parts of the globe, it was a favorable weather. In Europe, it was relatively warmer. So at the end of the day, I think that brand appeal and how brands mean to what brands mean to consumers is probably more important than the weather or the comps. For that matter, I think everyone was worrying about the comps and saying, oh, my God, the comps are going to be very tough. We decided to have Moncler as best idea for the fourth quarter because we saw that the brand momentum was very strong. Never mind the comps. Speaking of brand momentum, Caring released its results last Monday night after announcing less than a week earlier that Sabato DeSarno was going to leave the brand. I did a bunch of reporting on that. You did a bunch of analysis on that. And I was thinking back to when you and I chatted at the top of Sabato's reign and, you know, how retailers were reacting to it and where it would go. Curious to hear your thoughts. I thought one of the things that someone brought up to me was Francesca Bellantini, the deputy CEO of Caring, mentioning on the call that, like, yes, Sabato is not with us, but we're still on the same path that we were on when he joined. And we have made progress on that path, which I think in my mind is to become more of a Louis Vuitton or an Hermes and less of a fashion, fashion brand. So really be one of these brands that has something for everybody in some ways. And I'm just curious, A, what you thought of Caring's results overall and B, what you think the path forward is with Gucci and how long it's going to take them to. To actually turn it around. Well, the risk of stating the obvious. I thought that the Caring update was once again disappointing. Seeing Gucci down in the mid twenties is a clear indication as if there was any need for confirmation after seeing Caring fire Sabato Lissano that Gucci is not working. My understanding is that what Sabato has achieved is maybe cleanse the Gucci aesthetics and move it towards being more elegant. But what he has failed to provide is excitement and buzz and twist on top of this newly found elegance. So my from what I understand, I think that they want the creative director who is able to build on this platform was able to build on this elegance that Sabato has brought also this quality. I think that quality has also improved. But it was also going to be creating a buzz around the brand and making a bit of a sensation and also adding a fashion twist. I think that Gucci has two souls in a way on the one hand. It is sort of rooted in craftsmanship, rooted in leather goods. It comes from the same tradition as we thought, but then it has an equally important fashion forward soul that we saw very clearly with Tom Ford, especially when it came to his over the top communication and that we saw again, even to be with Alessandro Michela in the aesthetics of the products he brought to the market. In order to work, Gucci has to be able to mix the two and probably if you could criticize Alessandro Michela, it was too much on the fashion side. But Salvador D'Azana was too bland and too boring. So one has to find a bit of a happy medium, I think. But that is the task for the new creative director to accomplish. So who do you think it's going to be? This is the guessing game of the moment. We've seen so many names. I believe that given the need to sort of revive the interest and the attention for Gucci, it has to be some kind of heavy weight that could potentially bring a huge amount of attention. At the same time as Gucci is hoping to revive its fortunes in the second half of the year, the person that comes on board should be immediately available. So if you look at who is a heavy weight and who is a heavy weight that is currently available, I don't know that we have a very long list of potential candidates. I guess Hades Liman, John Galliano. I don't know if you would consider the outgoing creative director of Mew Mew, a number one or a heavy weight. Maybe these would be the three. I think that there was a lot of discussions about Mario Gratt's accruity potentially being a candidate. But I don't think so because the garden leave that you would have to serve is very long, 12 months, I believe. And by that time, Gucci would have to be already hard at work on the new direction. So I would not think that she's a credible candidate just because of the engagement she still has with Dior and the LVMH group. Yeah, I think what I've been told from people at Caring and what I know about her situation at LVMH is not to count her out. I think that she was interviewed for the job for sure, like that's whether or not. But I think you're right, the gardening leave thing. The one thing I know is that Hades Liman did not have a non-compete. So he is ready to go and he also bought an apartment in Milan. So why did he buy an apartment in Milan? We will never know. I also was told by people at Caring not long ago that they thought he was taking a break and just didn't want to do anything for a while or do fashion for a while. So who knows? Dario Battali, it seems like a really, I know he's a number one in the making. But I also know that he has definitely been in talks with Versace. And who knows? I haven't viewed these contracts, these ones. But I think they were close to being sure they were maybe close to signing someone, whether or not they had just signed someone or when the disarno break happened. I don't think, I think if they knew who, if the person was signed, they would have announced it the next day. And that hasn't happened. So yeah, I think that the LVMH, Maria Grazia situation is very complicated. And so it's going to, it would be hard. But when you think of Chanel, like the only answer at some point felt like it was Eddie Salman. And they went a totally different direction, but that's a different company that is already making the money in the way Gucci wants to make it. So I think like from a, who can make a big splash fast and get the product on the mark that people want to buy it and do that all really, really quickly? He's the answer. So I would love for it to be someone like Dario Battali to make it new and exciting, but it feels like they can't take a risk like that at this point, right? That would be my hunch. And they cannot even wait for two or three years given, you know, how pressing some of the improvements would appear. So they need to get sort of a shock therapy. And I guess that there's not many people that could potentially deliver that shock therapy. So I also think that Eddie Salman takes a lot of boxes. Then others point out that they were falling off with each other because when Eddie left, there was sort of a court ruling and Kering ended up having to pay money that they preferred not to have paid, whatever. I think that the rescuing, which is a far more important than they were, I agree, seven million euros or whatever it was that they were to pay. Easily forgotten. Indeed. Fall the money. So moving on, well, really quickly though, was there anything in the other? I saw that Botea was up not a ton, but a bit. Was there anything else on the Kering results that the San Juan or anything that you took note of? I think that the most important point I noticed is that Kering is now moving to make less money with Botega and San Juan. You saw that Botega was increasing sales, but was actually reducing the bit margin. I think this is appropriate because this is a fixed cost industry. These brands are relatively small. They compete in a very tough environment. The image has been escalating the, let's say, the ante that you need to play in the game. What these brands need is a lot more support in communication and in retail. They need better flagships, for example. They will have to provide for those with lower market.

One thing I've noticed, and their report feels like it was a week and a half ago at this point, or two weeks ago, it feels like it was ages ago. One thing I've noticed is that they seem to be really looking at their portfolio and saying, and they've always done this, gotten rid of stuff. I mean, they used to own Bliss Spa or whatever, and Christian Lacroix. So, they will sort of get rid of things occasionally, but I've noticed in recent years, I mean, they have a 70 person M&A team. So, it's not surprising that they're always looking at what they can get rid of and what they need to need to keep. And I thought your thesis on what was happening with wine and spirits seemed really on the mark and interesting. But also, there were reports in the French media about them potentially finally after years of trying to sell DFS, the duty-free company, which Arnaud during the earnings call did not deny that they were trying to sell it. I'm just curious, in this cycle of portfolio pruning, what you think they should do, what they obviously broke up with selling. Like, Cartney, but that was sort of expected. And I think that has less to do with them trying to prune their portfolio, more to do with that was a bad fit. But I'm curious what you think overall. They've been doing a little bit of pruning. You consider Stella, you consider White as well, recognizing that straightwear is no longer the flavor of the month. There must be a recognition that wends in spirits is no longer serving the purpose that it was serving in the past. It's not really helping to diversify what the business is, which is entirely dependent on professional leather goods, profits, no matter whether wends in spirits works or not. It works according to a different logic. So my understanding is that the writing is on the wall. If it's not now, a spin-off is probably what is to come on that front. DFS is losing a lot of money and they've been cutting loss making stores like the one in Venice, for example, and a few in Asia. An outright divestiture could potentially also be considered. And it's true that LVMH has a very long tail of underperforming brands in professional leather goods, but they've been always very reluctant to get rid of them. You mentioned Christian Lacroix, which was indeed one of the brands that at one point they divested pink. Oh yeah, Thomas Pink. I forgot about that. That was another one. I think that the moment they reached the conclusion that there's really no future for these brands, they do divest them. But in most cases, they prefer to keep them on the back burner if they don't lose a lot of money. I think the big difference is that if like DFS, they lose a lot of money, then it's a different story. It's a different story also because I think that brands like Dior need to invest. They need to inject more content in what they bring to the market. So it's not that at the moment you have other reservoirs where you can milk profit and and take care of losses very easily. It would be nice not to have too much of a bleeding anywhere. And so you're probably right. I think that this sort of cleaning up will continue maybe more softly. And I don't necessarily expect the big bang spinning off for one's spirits just at the trough. But we listened to Bernardo giving two years to Wuzhou Jacques. What you can accomplish in two years is not clear if the most important problem we have is demand, not being there like in China, for example. So I think that the next sensible thing to do is to sort of not divest because this is not the time to sell an asset like that, but just separate it and give shares of this business to the other mature holders and then they do what they like. Oh my. So what's interesting, the point you made about Dior really quickly and this is all, you know, I don't want to say speculative because it's a little more educated than that. But we know that Jonathan Anderson is going to work at Dior. Is he going to be the designer of both the men's and women's lines? It sounds like he is. But how that's all going to kind of work out and announce and everything. This is a person who is probably the biggest star of his generation. He's definitely a generational talent and who has taken Loewe from being a nothing brand to a two billion dollar business. Much of that has been driven by like really amazing marketing and runway shows. What I have talking behind the scenes about him being at Dior and I'm, as a consumer, a massive fan of his work and also as I would say like a writer who writes about fashion as a business reporter, my fear is that he's too niche or that he, that is such a big job. Like how will he inject excitement into it in a way that it feels like Dior. Raf Simmons did it, but it wasn't necessarily commercially successful with him. Like the commercial success did not have to do with Raf. Kim Jones obviously and Maria Grazia had tremendous commercial success, but maybe not as much runway success. Kim's last runway was really well reviewed, but generally people would be like, oh, I'm so bored. I'm so tired of it. But at the product level, it was really spectacular for a while until it wasn't. I'm curious what you think as an analyst of someone like, do they need someone like Jonathan Anderson who is, who has become like a celebrity in his own right because young people like his clothes, they like Loewe bags. I was on a plane the other day and a guy had a head to toe Loewe sweatsuit on and I texted it to a friend who worked at Loewe and they were like, oh, that's a counterfeit. That's kind of remarkable that they're a counterfeit Loewe sweatsuit. So I'm curious what you think. If he is the chosen one of Dior, like, do you think that that's what they need to get back on track? I think that big brands like, like Dior probably need to have a multi-pronged approach. They need to be clearly enjoying creativity and they need to have a newness that would bring consumers back to the stores. But it's also true that they, especially Dior, take care of a very broad audience with many different consumers at different price points and at different levels of sophistication. And I think that the trick to make big brand like Batwark, which is multifaceted, is probably in the team. And not only in the team of people you have, but also in a mix of tools you use. We saw recently, for example, with Don come back, I think largely on the back of this Takashi Murakami capsule that has been taking the world by storm. I wonder if a similar strategy could potentially be employed at Dior. Having an avant-garde capable designer is one of the elements. Then you need to have the way to attract attention and to create a buzz. And then you also need to have the commercial products in the stores. So you need merchandising, you need maybe a collaboration, you need a new creative director. You need quite a few things. And at the moment, there is not a lot that we can see. So for sure, I expect a lot of new news from Dior, considering that so far they've just provided news about who's leaving, but then who's coming and what are they going to do in order to get rapidly back center stage in terms of consumer retention. They lack consumer attention. Consumers are looking elsewhere today. And that you don't necessarily get back just with a new creative director, especially if that creative director is niche, because that is not going to appeal and it's not going to be understood by the wider public. Yeah. It's a good, the Murakami example is such a great point. I've heard it has blown expectations out of the water and it's just been an incredible success.

Or double digits in the U.S. But I wanted to ask you about, A, if you think their numbers were as good as they could be, and B, Axel Dumas actually ended up addressing the work in and all the dupes and all the counterfeits and all of that. In typical Hermes fashion, he was like, we're not going to put up with this, but also, I do feel for these people who can't afford Hermes, which I loved. But I'm curious what you think about that. Do you think they need to address it in any way, or it matters? Are the dupes over becoming so big that they actually are affecting the top line revenue? I doubt it. I think that imitation is the best form of flattery in a way. So it comes with the territory. If you are the most desirable brand, many will try to imitate you. Then it's down to Hermes to defend its intellectual property and then take matters to court where it's appropriate and fight. Mowing the grass, I think you never mow the grass once and for all. There's always going to be people wanting to try and copy you and provide dupes and counterfeits to the market. It is a sign that the brand remains vital and very prized by consumers. So I was listening primarily to the fact that Axel was annoyed by it to understand that for what they can and for what is infringing copyright, they will be trying to pursue anyone that steals intellectual property from them. When it comes to the results, they were really very good. I think that once again, this goes down to the fact that when consumers watch their pennies, like in China today, the last brand that they give up on is the most desirable one on their list. Hermes has been able to stay in that very high position for many consumers. This is the result of brand desirability. It's very good. In a way, an obless oblige was expected because the share price had already anticipated this move a lot. Country to Montclair, where you had a lot of doubters in the stock market, I don't think that if you could look at the Hermes share price, you had a lot of doubters on the buy side. So my sense was that to some extent, the good news were largely in the share price already. But in the case of Montclair, it was more of a genuine surprise because there were very, very few people supporting Montclair into the print. And luckily we were one of those. But that Hermes was to shine. This was, in a way, anticipated by the stock market. What about Richemont? How did people feel about their results? I think that Richemont has definitely done very well indeed, that there were only a few percentage points behind Hermes with their jury mesons. Jury is enjoying better value for money image in the eyes of consumers. And Cartier and Fonkly-Fernabell are at the very top of that category, with Tiffany and Bulgari commanding much less consumer traction. So I think Richemont is indeed in a very, very good position with a better and stronger management team, with cleaning up that has been done. We're talking about the image cleaning up. It's portfolio, luckily Richemont has separated itself from Yükstert-Apoctet. Luckily, finally, Luca. Finally, finally, yes, I should have said, finally indeed. It's been a journey. Which was indeed a very long and winding road. But at last we got there. And so I think that, of course, in the ideal world, you would want to have a little bit more clarity in the soft luxury business. But that is not too big that it hurts. I think that Richemont is in very good shape overall. Yeah. And it's interesting, like two years ago, the soft luxury, you just, why did they own it? And now, Chloe and also Alaya are both very hot brands with consumers. They're tiny compared to most of these other brands, but they are the ones that real fashion consumers are obsessing over right now. And so in a weird way, it's like, oh, well, maybe it's good that they kept them. They can get these successes every now and then. I think that the only thing they need to pay attention to, like when they had at one point to Chloe and the Fubi Fai, doing very well, not to get their best resources poached by competitors. If they can avoid that, then this sort of development could have lags and continue. Yeah, I think it's going to be tough. I think it's going to be tough, especially on certain fronts. Finally, Luca, looking ahead, and we see that everything is sort of improving. One thing I always think about in these cases is so many of these companies are really trying to mimic Hermes and Hermes' business. Or when a company is doing really well, I'm trying to think of another one that has succeeded. Or Gucci with Alessandro or Balenciaga with Demna, when those were at the height, all these other brands kind of tried to copy them. There's so much copying in fashion that's not about product. It's about business model. If suddenly something's working and then everybody's going to do it. As we move into this period of growth, what advice or points of analysis would you give these brands that see Hermes and they think, well, we just need to do what they do. The key is that Hermes doesn't do what anyone else does. They do what's right for them, and that's why they're successful. I think you should be respecting your DNA and you should stay true to yourself. I think that that is what Hermes does best. Axel said it very clearly when somebody asked him whether they would be on the lookout to buy brands. He said, we know how to run Hermes and we do a lot of the things right and we do a lot of the things wrong, but then paradoxically doing things wrong is helping us and it works for Hermes. It's a bit of a magic formula. They wouldn't necessarily be able to run a brand that was different in nature. They know how to play this game. I think every brand should be understanding the true reason why, what resonates with consumers, what could potentially read the pitfalls and work to avoid them and to enhance their equity with consumers. One very good brand example that I can think of that has been doing this over the past 10 or 15 years is Montclair. They haven't been mimicking anyone. They've been cognizant of the risk of becoming a uniform. They have continued to develop the brand into new spaces, not just into new categories, but also new price points to look at what they've been doing with Grenoble. That I think is deeply rooted in the Montclair DNA. That is looking at what cards you have and what kind of game you could play, irrespective of what brands with different cards do with it. Because what they do to some extent, if you don't have the same DNA, is quite irrelevant to you. Maybe if there was a mistake that I've seen recoveringly over the years is brands trying to mimic somebody else. That is never a good idea, I think. Being a me too without the qualities of the brand you're trying to imitate doesn't lead to success. No. Everybody listen to Luca. I know I always do. Thank you for being here. I know it's late where you are. I appreciate you. Thank you very much indeed, Lauren. And see you soon. Take care. Thank you.",
