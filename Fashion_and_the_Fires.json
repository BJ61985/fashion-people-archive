I'm still in Los Angeles just taking things day by day. This was a busy week online. I broke some Proenza news on Monday about their move to Loewe as the creative directors and also canceling the Perenza School or show in New York. Then by Wednesday, WWD had announced that they were actually stepping down from their label, Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCullough will no longer be the creative directors of Perenza School or but more on that from me in the email plus Sarah Shapiro had a great interview with Hill House home founder, Nell Diamond, big fan, really interested in that business. Great job and Rachel Struegatz dug into Charlotte Tilbury's dupe's war. You can't miss that one. Plus, on Thursday for Inner Circle members only, I wrote about how fashion is grappling with the fires as stars pull back from attending runway shows this upcoming season. This is just one example of the imbalance of power between fashion and Hollywood right now and I get deep into that. So don't miss it and let's get going with Aurora. There's a lot of pertinent information here and also just kind of taking a temperature check on how brands are reacting to what's happening here, how companies that are based here are reacting and Aurora is really knowledgeable and has a lot to say. So we actually had recorded this previously and had to rerecord to make it more about the fires and how the 15% pledge is helping. So you'll learn all about that and more coming up. Aurora James, welcome back to Fashion People. Oh my gosh, thank you for having me. Yeah, it's technically your first. We're going to scrap. We recorded last week in anticipation of the 15% pledge gala in early February. We were going to run it the Friday before, but everything that happened, we spoke on Tuesday, January 7th, I believe. Yeah, and in the afternoon and it was just as like the notion of the fires was starting to in the news or whatever, we were starting to learn about it and it didn't feel, I was working from my office, you were at your house, didn't feel like anything more than a typical, you know, the typical fires that happened in Los Angeles, but then everything changed. So you run three different companies. You run your shoe company, Brother Vellies. You are the founder of 15% pledge and then you are also the vice chair of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. So in the hours after we spoke, like what did your life look like and how did your stuff you were working on for all three of those businesses change? Yeah, I mean, I also work on a fourth which is parody collective, which is a private equity fund, but I think it's really impacted all sectors totally differently. Right after you and I spoke, I checked in on a friend and the feedback was like, oh my gosh, I think I'm about to lose my house, which is usually not the feedback when you hear about fires in LA, right? You think of a very specific area in Malibu that's like always at risk quote, and obviously this time we've seen that this is one of the largest catastrophes in the history of America, which I think is absolutely devastating. I think the question for me as someone who does a lot of work in nonprofit and advocacy is like, what's the best step moving forward? And for anyone that's listening that doesn't know, the 15% pledge normally has our biggest fundraiser on the first Saturday of February. We really kick off Black History Month. Our whole thing is about supporting small business in America, specifically founders of color. To be honest with you, Lauren, all that I wanted to do this past weekend when I was evacuated was cancel everything. I don't want to do this. I feel tired. I'm exhausted. People are losing everything. The last thing I want to do is plan an event. I was hauled up in a tiny room with my dogs. Then I started thinking about all of our vendors. Some of our vendors started outreaching to us. We just started getting a crazy amount of inbound because listen, it's a big event. We take over the back lot of Paramount Studios for the entire weekend. There's hundreds of small businesses that are involved. Then we started to understand even our florist who we work with all the time who's this incredible Black artist. She's based in Altadena. There's absolutely no way that I can cancel on all of these vendors at this point. It was so fascinating because everyone that was calling me over the weekend that was from New York was like, oh my God, you have to cancel it. They're sitting in their so-ho loft. Everyone in LA was like, wait, we actually need the work. We need to rebuild. We need to keep going. We need to resume business as usual. We need help, but we need to keep going. I think for me it was like, okay, first of all, do we have the capacity to keep going? What does that look like? Then how can we be of service in this situation? First thing we started to do was just reaching out to Black-owned businesses, reaching out to other businesses that were impacted and realizing, okay, we need to pivot so that 100% of our ticket sales for the weekend can actually go to businesses that are impacted. Then we need to be working with them on go forward business plans and assessing how much money do they need? Did they lose all their inventory? Do they have an insurance adjuster? We need to get insurance adjusters on this. We need to do actual real life tactical support. The last thing we need to be doing at this moment is like abandoning the people of LA that work on this event. We need to also be creating outsized opportunities for the rest of the public to actually help and support. Let's rewind for one minute. A lot of people that listen to this are going to know who you are and know a lot about the team percent pledge. Can you break down the purpose of the pledge, what you've done with it, and what this Gala's original purpose was? Then let's get into what the purpose has become and how you're structuring that. Yeah, sure. I am an accessories designer. I have a brand called Brother Bellies. We work with Artisans mostly across Africa and the diaspora. I started it in 2013. I consider it to be fairly successful, but I think I've always had a yen for working with different groups of people who've been historically excluded. When Mr. Floyd was murdered, I started getting a lot of calls and texts from people who were looking for ways to support the black community. A lot of those were major retailers. I said, I think everyone needs to do what they do best in service of those who have been historically excluded. I launched a call to action on my social media an hour after I had the idea. I said, major retailers should commit 15% of their shelf space to black-owned businesses. 10 days later, we had our very first corporation sign up, which was Sephora. Very quickly after that, we signed 29 businesses. Everyone from Macy's to Nordstrom, which signed a 10-year contract that was signed by Pete Nordstrom, all to beauty, kind of you name it. We just really tried to do the work of helping people gain access and opportunity. We put over 800 black-owned brands onto the shelves of our partners. If you walk into a Sephora store now, it's totally different than it was in 2019. We support a number of different founders. There's, I think, 10,000 in our business equity community right now, which is crazy. We help them partner with all kinds of different people just to make sure that they're getting the support that they need. I think for me, Lauren, I've always been such a huge fan of small business because I understand the impact that that can have. In 2020, it was just about, look, because of the pandemic, all of these small businesses are closing. Actually, 44% of black-owned businesses were projected to close, which was more than double the national average. I know that black communities are largely supported by black entrepreneurs in their neighborhood. It's really important for the health of the entire country that we really make sure that these businesses get the health that they need. That's really what the 15% pledge is all about. The private equity firm, are you a partner in it? It's part of a larger firm, correct? Yeah, it's part of a larger firm called BMG. What we did is we created something really special together, which is called Parity Collective. It's where we can actually do earlier-stage investments than they would ever normally do into founders that really make sense that I have gained relationships with or whatever because of the work of the 15% pledge and really make sure that we're giving those businesses all the support that they need. People like Dinesse and Myrex, people like Agedogastro. It's been really incredible. I think for me, Lauren, so much of this work, whether it's working with the Sephora or whether it's working on Parity Collective, is proving out the thesis that diversity isn't just a cute thing to do in 2020. It's actually just a really smart business decision because I know for me, in anything that I'm working on, I am going to do a better job if I have a diverse thinking in the room because I'm just not going to think of all the angles, right? That's really the approach. We really focus on working with partners across anything that I do that think in the same way. I think a big reason we've known each other for a long time, I think definitely over 10 years, maybe even 15 at this point. One of the reasons you are effective at what you do is because it isn't marketing. We're seeing a lot of DEI programs get taken away now. That's very complex and ill thought out. A big reason for that is because the people who built those programs in many cases or funded those programs were thinking about it from a marketing perspective and not from a business building blocks perspective. You really think of things as foundational. The Gala, which is happening February 3rd, correct? February 1st. February 1st. That's a Monday or a Sunday. It's a Saturday. Sorry. We're all turned around right now. It's a Saturday. It's Saturday, February 1st, that whole weekend. Your original plan was you were going to do the Gala. People pay to go to the Gala. You raise money for this fund that is supporting all these black-owned businesses. Then you were also planning on doing an entire festival slash market so people could shop the goods. Consumers could come and shop the goods the whole weekend. What has changed now about that plan? 15th Street Block Party. Our Gala is the 15% pledges largest fundraising event of the entire year. We sell tables to any number of different people. It's a pretty traditional fundraiser. We have a really fun dress code called Black Tie Black Designer. That's going to continue on. We're also going to be raising money in the room for founders who have lost everything because of the wildfires. We normally don't raise money in the room at our Gala. It's really community focused. Last year, Dr. Biden was there. We honor people. This year, we're really going to be focusing on honoring a lot of founders who've just been the pillars of their community, not just in Los Angeles, but other parts of the country. I think, the idea is just taking over this entire Paramount Backlot for the whole weekend. There's the fake movie set stores that you've probably seen. If you've ever been to the Paramount Backlot before, we take those over and turn them into real Black-owned businesses. Diotima, La Chanture, there's a Sephora store where you can buy all the Black-owned businesses that are at Sephora. The Korea Secret has a store that they've paid for for Black founders. There's just a number of different things. We have a bookstore that's all banned books. We have a ton of... Mickalene Thomas is coming to have art there where all the proceeds are going to be going to displaced founders. She's also going to be assigning books. It's really just a whole weekend of celebrating small business and resilience and perseverance and community. We really try to bring it to life as much as possible. There's going to be a ton of food trucks. What we're changing is, A, we're going to be adding a lot of businesses. All these businesses in Altadena that have been impacted, we've been touched with them and are trying to get as many of them there in whichever way makes sense for them. We're going to be giving out a lot of grants as well, which is obviously really important, fundraising for these businesses directly. Then 100% of the proceeds from our ticket sales for the entire weekend are going to be going directly to these businesses that have been impacted because of the wildfires.

It's a place where middle-class white people are moving in droves because it's still pretty affordable, really nice. I know a lot of people that lost their homes what I was less informed about because of who I am and the kind of media I consume and all of that. I don't spend a lot of time there. Go out to dinner there once every six months or whatever. Is that it has a big black community as well. And a lot of the people who have been hurt the worst in this fire are black people and black homeowners and also small business owners. So what did you know about that community prior to this and what have you learned and are any, I'm assuming some of the businesses you mentioned your florist, but I'm sure there are other businesses involved that are directly connected to that community are based there. Yeah, there's a bunch that are based there. What I know about Altadena is it's always been sort of this really vibrant black neighborhood. There's a bunch of friends of mine that live there, some are black, some are not as you mentioned, but just seen a Blake knee from Jungle Low who has an incredible business is a huge advocate and kind of community leader in Altadena. Chantel from Offerings is also based in Altadena. Amani Ellis, who's a great storytelling teller on social, her entire family is from Altadena. A lot of people's parents first home or grandparents first homes were purchased in Altadena for like $15,000. And to be honest with you, Lauren, a lot of the people that we've also been in touch with are people who were either kicked off of their insurance or also maybe were able to afford insurance. So it's a really top situation. And I think for me, it's, listen, anyone losing everything is horrible no matter what color you are. I think for me, it's just how do we make sure that these people are not left behind? How do we make sure that these people also have a lawyer to help with insurance claims? How do we make sure that these people are still able to collect FEMA money even if they started to go fund me on day one for $5,000 or something, just figuring out some of those logistics and also making sure that there's a plan to get them back on their feet. But yeah, I mean, it's really tough and the neighborhood is gentrifying in the way that so many other neighborhoods are gentrifying. And I think gentrification is a whole other issue. But I think what remains to be seen in Altadena, Pasadena, Palisades in terms of rebuilding efforts and who swoops in, who stays around for the rebuild, all of that I think is, you know, it's going to be tricky. Yeah, I don't, maybe everybody in the world is familiar with this, but something that I didn't really realize up until a couple of months ago is that it's actually just getting next to impossible to get your house insured in California, in Southern California. Like it's really, really hard. It's expensive. And so a lot of these insurance plans are running out and they don't have them. And the thing is, when you think about who will be able to rebuild, it's going to be people with money. It's going to be people who can negotiate with the lawyers. It's so when people are thinking about you and I were texting the other day and you and I were texting and I said, you know, where should people be giving their money? And I've gotten also a lot of fashion brands are like, I want to donate stuff or I want to give stuff. And the thing is, really think about where you're putting it. Think about the GoFundMe's that you're putting money into if you're an individual. Think about if you're a fashion brand or whatever, great to write down inventory. I have a whole list of places that are looking for like tons of units. And if you're a big company, you need to write down some old inventory. This is a good opportunity to do that and help people. But also, how are we going to keep these people in their community? Is I feel like what everyone in LA is thinking about right now? And I'm closer to Altadena. So that's where my focus is as a part of the community. But you're right, it's happening in the Palisades. It's happening all over everywhere that was affected in the city. Yeah, I mean, I think it's, we sort of battled with this a little bit at the CFDA too, right? So what we've done there with CFDA carries is really set up a strategy to receive like large scale donations and clothing and beauty, totally unused stuff and are going to be putting like wardrobe kits together, people who need just a whole new wardrobe or then also the opportunity for people to actually come in and select things. But then in a larger, broader sense, just like being able to distribute on the ground like mass amounts of underwear, socks, denim, if necessary. And I think all of that is super, super important. And I think it's really helpful to be able to organize and implement in a way that really makes sense. And I think, listen, people also have to know their lanes a little bit as different organizations. It's like the 15% pledge is not an emergency aid organization. We focus on small businesses. That's what we know. And that's the angle that we're going to take, right? The Pasadena Humane Society is going to take a different angle. So I think to your point, right, when you're saying people should really think about how they're helping, this is exactly right. It's like, if you are a lawyer, like, I probably don't need you to like donate your, you know, Provenza dress. Okay. If you want to sell someone your Provenza dress for $2,000 and then donate that $2,000 to Altadena girls, that's good. You know, that Provenza dress is probably worth more money now since they stepped down from their brand. That's why I said 2000, Lauren. That's why I said 2000. It's a really good point. I have all these bags of stuff that's not fancy enough for the real, real. And I haven't known what to do with it. And I was like, Oh, I'll drop it off somewhere this week. And then I realized as the week went on, I was like, nobody wants this shit. No one wants that. You can drop it at like Crossroads. And when they give you your $60 check, you can like go online and donate that. I forgot about Crossroads. I feel like they don't take as much as they used to, but good point. Good point. And I mean, there are other things we could, we could be doing. So yeah, we could put it directly into a landfill in Africa also that. Exactly. So CFDA, what are, what are the brands with your, you're talking to businesses of all different sizes that are being affected differently by the, some people are based here. Some people just have a lot of retail here. This is different from COVID in that it's only, it's regional. So this is a huge place of business for a lot of brands that are in the CFDA, but it's also not their entire business other than how they can help. What are the concerns of the businesses right now? I mean, I think it's really confusing for people, right? Because for most people in America, this fire is playing out on social media, right? And on their news app. So, you know, we did our like tasting yesterday for the event, which felt like kind of weird to do, you know, and it's, there was some people that came in from New York and they were like, whoa, we were like expecting the air to smell like smoke and to see like fire from the plane and like no one's wearing a mask. And like, it was hard to get a dinner reservation and like this whole city's like popping with the heck, you know, and, and I think it just LA like feels like Armageddon if you're watching the apps. And, and in some ways, to be honest with you, Lauren, like it is, this is a gigantic catastrophe, you know, and that cannot be understated. But I think in that same breath, what we don't want for LA is like an abandonment, right? Totally. The watch LVMH watch week was supposed to be next week and they moved it. And I thought, damn, I wish they hadn't. No, no, there's going to be a big backlash against people taking work out of LA right now. Yeah. I mean, I've talked to you these days, I've talked to so many vendors, like caterers, dancers, musicians, comedians, like everyone like who haven't I talked to this weekend, you know, and the fear is just that like, oh, this isn't going to just impact us now, it's going to impact us in Q2, it's going to impact us in Q3. And then also like this guy is trying to buy Greenland, like it just is just really chaotic for people right now. Yeah, about Greenland. No, just kidding, we're not getting into that on here. You can listen to the powers that be Puck's daily podcast with Peter Hamvey about Greenland. But it's interesting because there's a bigger, if you zoom out and look at LA and what's happening in the city, COVID, the strike, people not going to the movies, this is a real company town, the entire ecosystem, the entire economy is based around Hollywood, maybe not as much as it was 20 years ago, but still very much so. I think it's diversified a bit in the last 10 years in particular. But I was talking to someone, this is probably two or three months ago, has lived out here since the early 2000s. And I mentioned I was from Pittsburgh. And he said, you know, LA is kind of like the Pittsburgh of this era, in that the thing is Pittsburgh was like a mill town that it recovered, but in a weird way from my husband always jokes, you always talk about the urban Renaissance in Pittsburgh that never actually happened. But it's like economically fine, but like culturally, I never really recovered from all the mill stuff. But this guy was saying, he's like, oh, it's like LA is sort of like Pittsburgh, because this is like a dying industry that still makes a ton of money. And it's just going to be this slow thing. And this is just like the latest part of that. But on the other hand, there are so many people here who have so much money who have nothing to do with the entertainment industry, or they've already made so much that that doesn't matter. From a business ownership perspective, and being someone who has only been based, you've lived here before, but lived here for like the last five years. What do you think happens to the city, and especially for designers and people who work at brands who might do a lot of business here, but who aren't based here, what do you think the sort of next phase of Los Angeles is going to be as they do rebuild? Yeah, such an interesting question. I mean, it is tough, like the amount of work that's being taken out of LA is really tough. And I think the impacts there will be really real. I think creativity in certain worlds has always struggled a little bit in Los Angeles. And I'm not sure that that struggle is going to get any easier. And, you know, fashion wise, I'd say it's really interesting because I would say that the fashion presence in LA is actually growing. Yeah. And I do think that how people consume content is changing, right? Like we may not be making as many like sitcoms that are being shot at the Paramount back lot anymore. But we do have a ton of creators. And we do have a lot of new businesses that are popping up here that are sort of rewriting the narrative a little bit. You know, so I think it all still remains to be seen. Despite these wildfires, I will say like, and obviously that's a gigantic caveat, but like Los Angeles is still an incredible place to live and work. So I'm not sure that people are going to want to abandon it, but will it become harder to afford to live here or an aspiring actor? Yes. Yeah, I feel like also the sort of center of where people choose to build and to live. I mean, I don't know if you can build anything more in large mom, but I just see everyone. It's going to just all the $4 million homes, they're going to be $7 million in like two years. Right. Totally. That part's very crazy. I mean, you know, I hope that LA can really lead the charge on some climate change innovation. I mean, California is the eighth largest economy in the world, right? Yeah. Like, something's got to give. I mean, people are blaming this fire on everything except for climate change. If you watch certain television stations. Yeah, well, not everybody likes to believe truth. Right.

Like, what are you going to be working on in the next few days in the lead up to the gala? And what is your advice to people who really want to do something meaningful and impactful? I mean, well, first of all, shout out to everyone that's fostered an animal, because we love to see that. President Humein has like nothing left, I guess, last time I checked. What I would also just say is like, I think be really thoughtful and do some research on where you want to make donations if you want to make donations. I think that, you know, clothing is great, but I'm sure like the CFDH designers probably have it under control. Like, I anticipate there to be like tens of thousands of units of clothing that are being donated. And I think that's really helpful. But, you know, what else, right? It's like, what's your specialty and how can you help? You know, would love to see 6,000 people come to Paramount Studios on February 1st and 2nd. So, you know, buy a ticket for yourself, buy a ticket for other people in your office, buy a ticket for all the girls in the Alte Dina girls, like buy a ticket for everyone. We're giving 100% of those proceeds to businesses who've been impacted. And I think continue to show up for LA, right? If there's a business that you know that's in a tough spot, buy a gift certificate. A lot of us learn these skills during the pandemic, right? So, I hate to go back there mentally, but, you know, show up, support, continue to support the advocates that are actually doing some of this work, ask questions, don't make assumptions, don't feed into some of the myths and disinformation online, you know, like, and remember that LA is going to have to rebuild. And not everyone that was impacted is a bajillionaire because I've also seen a lot of that, like kind of weird combo online. It's like, that's the people that, you know, listen, like, don't get me wrong, I do have some very wealthy friends who like lost their second homes, right? But that's not the vast majority of the experience that's happening right now. And it doesn't do anyone any good to focus on some of that negativity. Yeah, we just, we have a lot of work to do. And I think it's one step in front of the other. Well, I'm sure everyone who's listening to this will be not only buying tickets for February 1st and 2nd, but they'll also be flying out here just to attend. I mean, amazing. I just, I love to see a ticket to LA. It's going to be fantastic. I hope I get to meet some of these Altadena girls. I love this whole thing. It's so fabulous. I'm sure you will. Do you want to meet the Compton Cowboys? You know, you can meet whoever you want. February 1st and 2nd. I'm very excited. It's going to be great. You have to get your, your, your tarot card read, Lauren, you could even get your hair braided if you want. Oh, I don't know if I should get my hair braided, Aurora. I'll advise you before I'm, but I'm definitely getting my tarot cards read and I will be there. Adopted dog. Did you know that black cat, or a cat, did you know that black cats are the least adopted? That's so interesting. Everybody do that. It was great to chat again. I'm sorry that our other conversation was for not. I didn't ask you what you had for breakfast because it felt a little irrelevant even though this is a Friday show. Your coffee. We really got, next time you come on, we can get into your coffee routine because it's really good. But thank you for doing this and all that you do. Everyone, you should follow Aurora on social media. You should follow the 15%, 15% pledge. You should follow CFDA. You should follow brother Vellies and you should also, I just parody, parody collective have an Instagram account. No, we don't. But Aurora is out there raising money and advising these small brands. So that's just one more thing that she somehow manages to do. So congratulations and thank you for all you do. And don't bug her too much. If you have a question for her, you can DM me and I'll give the answer. Thank you so much, Lauren. You're really a light in this situation. Thank you. Yeah.
