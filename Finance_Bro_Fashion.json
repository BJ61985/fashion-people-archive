Hey everyone, hope you had a great week. I am in Milan recording this from my Airbnb on Thursday morning. I'm about to go to the Max Mara show. I'm leaving very early, so I'm not late. Judgy, I love you. Can't wait for the show. There's a lot going on in the next couple of days though. Prada, Moschino, Gucci, these are all shows that I love going to because I can kind of see what's happening with the business not only by looking at the runway, but looking at who's at the shows, where people are seated, all that stuff. So I will have a lot more intel on what's going on here in real life in Line Sheet at puck.news. You should check it out. I also have a ton of M&A reporting this week. There is news about a Viori fundraise. There is news about the Rose investment. I have more intel on that and there is much more to come.

They're about to launch two fragrances. Now, like I don't care that they're launching two fragrances. I was like, who cares? It's not a big deal. Rachel explains why it's a giant deal to the company and to the executives. And she really has all the insight intel. She is the leading reporter on all beauty business stuff, but Glossier in particular is sort of her thing. So I really encourage you to look at that story in particular. Glossier is the company to watch right now. Are they going to get sold? Are they going to sell? Are they going to buy something else? Like what's going to happen with them on the M&A front is the thing to watch in beauty. So so make sure to look at that.

I hope you enjoy this episode with the industry folks. I started watching the show day at day, but I think at the height of the pandemic. I love it. To me, it's like a mix of the newsroom, Mad Men and Uncut Gems. First of all, I did not watch the whole series of the newsroom, but I did watch some of it. I'm not going to deny it. But like it's way better than that, obviously. And not better than Mad Men, but it's a really good show. I love it. The way they approach fashion is really interesting. The world of London finance and the city in particular, just it's really unique. And Conrad and Mickey are also like into fashion. They are friends with a lot of fashion editors. And we talk about that. And Laura costume designers, I just find Laura, their costume designer really good at communicating because they have to go to these showrunners or directors who have what they're working with and explain what they want to do and how they want to bring the characters to life and all that stuff. And so it was a really fun conversation. I want to have more people like this on. So if if you are interested, let me know. And I hope you enjoy it. Let's get started. Conrad, Mickey and Laura, welcome to fashion people. Hello. Hi, sir. Thanks for having us. Thanks for having us. So usually on the Friday episode, I ask everybody what they have for breakfast today. So long time ago. Are you all in the UK right now? Yeah, I think I were. Yeah, are you in London? Yeah, I'm in London. I don't have any breakfast. I'm in Eley. No, I should. No, I skip. I skip it a lot. I tend to skip it a lot. I had breakfast, but I had cereal for lunch. So it was sort of like a very breakfast. I often do that as well. I'm more of an eggs person, but we'll eat breakfast for lunch because you got to do that 12 hour window. Yeah, I'm also I'm also just my family is away in Greece by myself. So I'm sort of living a parallel lifestyle. So which is why I'm having to do it. It's about three o'clock in the afternoon. Sounds perfect. Laura, what did you have? I had very hurried toast as I went to the studio and a and a flash cup of coffee. It's so delicious. So yeah, it's super glamorous and I'm very proud of myself. No protein, though. No, no, I take that for lunch. So we're here to talk about your show industry and I have been a fan since the first episode and really like the way you approach fashion. And I from one of my line sheet readers, I got the question for you all. I sent a message being like, what should I ask the people behind industry? And they said, what did this guy say? He said, well, it could be a woman, actually, I have no idea. But question for the industry folks, how did they nail down the clothes for the character? So while I work for JP Morgan and I have never seen such an accurate portrayal of finance wear. So I'm not asking you that yet, but the point being that been watching really closely. But also I was very excited because I was invited to the premiere of industry in New York and I live in LA, so I couldn't go. But I just thought I was so special. And then I saw that like 15 fashion editors are invited, all the Rory and Jacob from the journal, the throwing fits guys. And then I found out you guys are in cahoots with the throwing fits guys. But before we get started on the show, like how interested are you? Are you all just like big fashion collectors? And Laura, I know you're an expert in a different way. So you probably have a totally different relationship with fashion. But Mickey and Conrad, what are you like? Are you all fashion? Do you guys spend like are you big shoppers and all that? Fairly big. I'm a last paper Conrad and he can obviously jump in as well. But I've always been interested in fashion and just in clothes. Like as a reflection of where I am in my life, my identity, personality. I think it's hard not to be. I think you can either sort of have it's hard not to be influenced by it. That sort of starting point of personality almost. And I think it's beyond just the show. I mean, I love I love the the word of the show in terms of the fashion of it. But I think, you know, it probably comes from me and Conrad's fascination with with it as a concept. Just like the fact that we like wearing clothes. The throne, the throne face guys is more of a function of the five. Well, like we we they were big early adopters of the show. So Eddie, like loud, vociferous online fans in season one, we were like collecting like gold dust. And Jimmy and Larry like so such early adopters. And like, to be honest, I even before I heard them, I didn't actually know that podcast about clothes. And then we've been on it subsequently two or three times. And they're just a kind of fantastic guy. So I think we would hang out with them in New York, regardless of whether they had a fashion podcast or not. Really cool to talk about clothes that much for the last time. It's so funny that people call Lawrence Larry. I think that's new. I saw we've ever noted as to the. I need to do a bit to be James introduced himself as Jimmy and particularly horny Jimmy when he first met her. And now I think now Lawrence has become Larry. This is a new thing where this is a new identity they've adopted. So I've not heard this for the last like couple of times Lawrence has come up. They've been like, Larry, I'm like, who's Larry? I've never heard of this person. It's very funny. Yeah, they have a quite remarkable, they have a quite remarkable personal style in the sense that I would say mine and Ricky's is quite fixed, but or at least at least this, this cyclicality of his is quite widely distributed. Whereas with those guys, I feel like every time I see them, they're kind of like something new going on. I haven't quite been able to get my head around. They dress very well. They're going to be wrong, but it's very far. They're very trendy. If you Google Lawrence 2010, you're going to get a whole different human being. Then he went through like a Margiela phase. He really he's he was very like Italian menswear, hashtag menswear. He was a big part of that. And then he got into Margiela. He's very trendy guy. James, I don't know as much about his clothing. I've on. They're going to allow them to have seven minutes on them. I don't know. Because I'm so sorry about this. Oh, they're never going to listen to this. There's no way they'll ever listen to it. It's a very I kind of I would I wouldn't say I was a trendy person, but I'm definitely I definitely changed the way I dress quite significantly, probably every two years. Yeah. And what you end up with is looking back at photos of yourself and cringing. I think that's probably the mark of someone that's like affected by trends. I imagine I'm not going to. I imagine that looks at all photos themselves as Margiela period. I cringe because I definitely would. Agreed. Laura, what about you? You were obviously like a student of this as well. But do you are you really into your own clothes? Or I know a lot of designers aren't actually. Well, it's funny. It feels like with costume, you kind of are in two camps. Some people aren't interested in some people live and breathe it. So it's all a bit different with with costume. I think sometimes when I think about characters, I think are they the kind of people that it's a bit like your approach to food? Do you live to eat or do you enjoy eating? It's that sort of like you go out there and look for really good food. And it's like that with clothing. It's like, how do you how do you approach your dressing? So that's kind of like a way into thinking about how characters dress. Because it's how people are when they choose their clothes. Some people just do not care. And it's a bit like shoveling, I don't know. Yeah, well, not not toast. It's not really fair. But anyway, it's it's it's sort of shoveling very bad food in in the morning and then the scurrying about. And yeah, it's it's sort of similar. It's like, how do I how do I put myself together? And some people just don't think about that at all. And I mean, definitely, as when you do kind of costume, your style evolves a little bit, especially of spending quite a lot of time on set. But I'm a bit of a time, yeah, you know, you love you love clothes. I love fabric. I'm a bit of a techno fabric geek. I love that. That's one of my favorite things. New fabrics, I get really excited. They go to trade shows quite a lot and look for things. I wonder also, and then we can actually talk about the show. But I wonder, do you think I don't know of you all have spent a lot of time in like real America, but I do wonder. I lived in the UK for a couple of years after college and have spent a lot of time there and in Europe for work. And there's just like a different approach to clothing is like a part of people's life there, whereas clothing here, it's changed a bit now that it's become more. There's like a more of an enthusiast culture around it. But there are a lot of people where in America, it's still not like OK to be obsessed with buying clothes and like being really into fashion. It's it's seen as sort of separate from being into film and movies and all that stuff. Whereas I think in Europe, it's kind of the fabric of culture. Do you think that like you all being really interested in fashion? If you had grown up in, I don't know, L.A. or even in Seattle or something, if or do you think that it's being part of British culture that you all like had to hone your style pretty early? I think as a generalization, I mean, maybe you're talking about different pipe, but I think as a generalization, like people are a lot more stylish as a base in New York or they are in London. I think people think about it way more. I think even just walking around like you think people like a lot of people have put a lot of thought in their clothes, even if they're trying to have a style where they're not. And I think there's a lot more to start putting stuff on the UK and even in London, which is basically sort of a fashion. Well, yeah, I don't know. Maybe maybe the disc maybe like, but then maybe generally across the UK, there's more of an interesting fashion in clothes than there is across the US as a whole. And I should like pass the US, what could be going to the fuck about it? Obviously, that's true in the UK as well. But just maybe because the UK is a lot smaller than maybe it's just they've been more cohesive. Yeah. I also wonder if the High Street, the High Street was so much better in the UK than in the US for so long that especially when I lived there in the mid 2000s, like Topshop and all that stuff, good clothes were more accessible to people, whereas now there's more of an even playing field everywhere. Yeah, I think that's kind of an unaligning thing. I don't know. I remember really waiting for clothes to turn up and it was you had to go on a bit of a quest to find things like you look for your style tribe. And like, I mean, definitely when I was first going to clubs and stuff, you knew where a good club was. You could see where cool people you could see from the music, what they were into, what their clothes were like, whether you would want to go there or not. But it was hard to find that look. So you knew if they were looking in those places, you were probably into the same things. Yeah. So how did you so what is the process when you're developing a show? Like, how did you all end up working together? When do you pull in Laura to start working and developing the the costumes and the sort of personalities of the people who are of the characters? Like, what what part of the process does that begin? Well, I mean, Laura and Laura worked on our third season and we tend to be a function of we come back, we've written scripts when we go into pre-production, we start to hire all the HODs, the heads of department and which obviously costume is one of those. Now, me and Mickey, me and Mickey are very exact thing. I think in some ways, the specificity and our exactitude is why people respond to the show. That can also sometimes make us, even though we are very collaborative, it can be quite, you know, I think sometimes people can feel a little bit stymied by that. But with Laura, we were a small RHN is really it's kind of like we want people to, you know, we hire someone who's talented, Laura, there's no point in them just sort of you you're not delegating them and they're not coming up with brilliant ideas for the characters. And I think like not to denigrate anybody's work on season one or two, but season three, I feel like there was far more storytelling done through the characters costume, through their choices, through what they were choosing to wear, what they were not choosing to wear. Laura, maybe you could speak a little bit more in terms of your process of working with us, both positive and negative. God, it's really tricky because it sounds really, at least really cringy, but it was it's like you give so much in the script that is so rich as as like character development, it really sort of fills out the psychology of the people that you're creating. And then we have the input of the actors as well. And then you sort of think about the whole arc. So we think about the arc of the story and where you want to take it. And the pointers that you gave to me, it was really, really great. And so within that, you say, well, how much great stuff can I find that can help tell the story, but not like or show elements, but not overtake things. And that's kind of what I do. And it was really great to have the freedom to do that because it's such a rich text, you know, and then it becomes more than a text. It's a really great, you know, it's really great writing, and it's really fun to work with like that. So, you know, I kept thinking about there's this like line in the very first episode about this Heronwes Bosch painting, and that was the boat. And that was like a big jumping off point for me because those paintings were kind of commissioned by sort of like early merchant bankers and stuff in the sort of in the Renaissance Europe. And it was like, well, that feels like a perfect thing to me to kind of find a way of using that painting as a kind of way of thinking about the whole show and what you can do in costume with that. So like the Garden of Earthly Delights basically is a triptych painting. And on the outside, it looks like nothing, but on the inside, it's like a world of gray sphere of gray. And on the inside, it's like this riot of color. And then every single part of the painting, there's something crazy going on there. It's like, what the hell is happening in that picture? Do you know it? Yeah, it's crazy that that was painted when it was painted. Yeah, in the Prado. It's insane. It feels like it was from the future. Like it doesn't feel like it was possible for that painting to be painted when it was. That was my experience when I saw it. Yeah, it makes me think of like all this Huxley and all this like devils of Nudon and everything. And it's like, this is kind of brilliant. And there's something about it where, you know, those paintings were painted to kind of absolve yourself or absolve the commissioner of their sins. So it was just something about the imagery of that and the symbolism. It's like, well, what are the cues that you can take from that to kind of bring into things in the clothes, you know, and it was particularly for the boat sequence. I mean, there's like a two piece outfit in that, which is worn by one of the party guests. And it's basically, it's the print of that painting. So it was things like that, you know, it's like, it's good to see it there. And then you kind of move on. But it's one of the many little bits and pieces that we kind of put in that was interesting and flant to see. But the thing that I was most impressed by with Laura, when we first met her is that the marriage between sort of concepts and a conceptual way of looking at the design in the way that she's just outlined, married to like massive amounts of specificity. And that's kind of what exactly, you know, me and Conrad, when we first came out of the industry, kept saying that the watch word for it was authenticity. And that stretched to the specificity of the way people dressed. And, you know, you mentioned Lauren at the start, I'm referring to J.B. Morgan saying they got it right. But I think if you were to look at it the way that people dress the show, as a broad canvas, quite far away, say, okay, lots of like gray, brown, gray and navy suits and white shirts, lots of dark shoes, pretty much everyone's wearing the same thing as lots of zip up vests. But like, in every single character to like, supporting characters to the background actors, everything is being thought about the way how many belt loops they've got if they wear dark shoes, if they wear tassels. What does that say about their background? What does that say about what school they went to? All that stuff students, I mean, Conrad, I think about constantly. And Laura, when she came onto the show, had exactly the same kind of life about kind of specificity. So it was a matter of like, really big picture, really interesting thinking whether she's just done married to like, really kind of nerdy specificity. I was just gonna say the good thing about doing multi season as well versus one season is that like, obviously, as you grow and your social circles, and your socioeconomic status change changes, you're exposed to different things and your taste level changes, right? So like, or something, you know, some people's taste level actually receipts, right, as they get more money, or people can people have less money and haven't been credibly dialed in taste level over multi seasons, I think like, you can really see that in some of like Harper's wardrobe, like, and I was something Laura really pushed for us. And like how much she wants to show or portray a certain version of herself to the world, especially when we she was working in that ESG fund. And they're going back to like the kind of, you know, she was wearing all these, currently I'm rolling with her, but like softer colors, soft finishes. And then as soon as she got her power back, she was back into like, you know, the leather that she preferred to wear the second season. So there were just all of these things that you can do on a multi hour story that you could never really do in a movie. Yeah, the thing I would say that is consistent through the three seasons to me, is that everybody looks very individual, like many shows have a, the show obviously has a look, but it doesn't the clothes don't, it's not the whole show, a lot of shows, everybody has the same style. And that's fun. And that's fantasy. But the specifics, like you all were talking about, it makes it feel like these are individual wardrobes. And that is, that's really unique. One thing I think I heard you all talk about this on a podcast or I read it, there was something about a Ferragamo versus Hermes tie in the first season. Was this you all I can't remember, but it was something about the Ferragamo tie is like a higher status person wears that above an Hermes, which I wouldn't have known that. Like, it's, is that still true? Yeah, like, it's no many West ties with the trading floor and in banks anymore, really, and they're sort of working for a pretty old school place. And we reflected that in the last few seasons, like the dress code, especially after COVID was relaxed quite a massive, quite a lot. But especially when me, Conrad, are working there, I mean, I would say nearly old school, British, slightly blue blooded people with the Ferragamo, because it was like Hermes, even though it was very expensive, was considered kind of like, it's all of this considered entry level, like almost slightly naff. And Ferragamo, and you'd also have a Ferragamo tie and it would always be, and that it would be tied in a way that was never tucked in. So we just feel like flopping about and you see that sort of like Ferragamo, like a diagonal logo, and it would always be the sort of the, as I said, the really crusty older guys would wear it. And the, and it would always be quite old, and it would be obviously in like, you know, worn many, many times and tied up to like a tiny little peanut knot, whereas like the younger guys who had just got their first bonuses were like, you know, an Hermes with a big eight with HSI and it was brand new, bought this like two weeks ago. How did you all approach the, let me find his name, the tech CEO guy that's on Game of Thrones, Henry? What, how did you all, I, well, first of all, this is the first time I've ever pre-watched a show. I binged it in like, because I got the screeners in like two days. And it's such a strange experience because now people are processing and seeing it. And it's almost like you have to rewatch it again. If you're a TV person, you would just have to like rewatch it again to feel like in the experience. And because it was so crazy to experience this last season and not be able to talk about it with anyone other than my husband, just like, know what, I was like, I need to know what other people think about what just happened in the toilet or whatever. Like, it's, I was just like, like shocked again and again. But, oh, just like tech CEO, but like really, really aristocratic posh guy. And what that person in this life wears now, like was the, like how much are on these sort of ancillary, I know he plays a big role in the season, but like, a sort of, how much are these like secondary characters, how much are you spending time on kind of crafting their wardrobe story? That's unique. Well, you really, you really think about it because they're no less important, because you've got to believe them. You've got to know them when you see them immediately and say, ah, I know that guy. And I know that woman. So you spend as, yeah, I mean, it's kind of like the thought process that goes into it is the same, because they've got to have a level with the person that they're appearing with in the same scene. They've got to have complete parodies, because you're making a world and you're asking people to buy into that world all the time. So for Henry Muck, you know, it's, you kind of encounter him, you know, I've encountered him in different iterations all over the place. You know, he's a charming, yet difficult man who will appear and then sort of disappear. But you will, I mean, it's sort of, yeah, you meet people like that in London in the film industry all over the place regularly. But then, yeah, so it was looking at just the different kinds of choices that he would naturally make, the kinds of labels that he would go to, the bits of, you know, sort of like you can map London in terms of wealth in some ways quickly. There's sort of elements of West London and where they would go, you know, his country seat is in the West country. And so it sort of makes sense that he would choose the things that he wears in the show. He's trying to appear to be very much part of this kind of a meritocratic society. But when it comes to it, he can always draw on his connections to get him out to situations which he frequently does. And this is what he does in the show. There were little details like, for example, when you first see him when he's in Lumi, he was wearing a Lumi t-shirt, but it's sure and he had like, you will see that like, it was very deliberate, but like one of the colors stayed under the t-shirt and one was outside of it, which was to suggest the kind of a disassembling, not altogether kind of guy who, because like as successful as he is, it was very important part of our conception of him. And there was a slight element of a chance about him, like a slight element of someone who due to his schooling, due to his university education, where he was from, that there was a kind of sailing upwards to him. And there's someone like that, I guess, we drew through charm, obviously through intellect, but also through the power of bringing people within in terms of what his accent conveyed the moment he opened his mouth, was able to get it right to the top of a company like this. But that, you know, like the thing we talked about, me and Mickey, there was this kind of Boris Johnson, I wrote into him, and part of Boris Johnson's ruse or if it's facade, it's to constantly look a little bit disheveled, a little bit underdressed, a little bit like he doesn't think about that stuff, that it's part of his, you know, full staff here and whatever you want to call it, charm that makes people think that, you know, keeps people not looking in too closely, but also keeps all of the attention on him all the time. He has one of the specific dress senses in the show. And as Conrad said, like, if you look at that first two first couple of scenes in Lumi, and he's really scruffy, there's loads of signifiers of actually who he, I mean, like what he's at least trying to be. There's like his Apple Watch, there's his ordering, there's the Lumi shirt, there's that horrible white, you know, bell the posh people wear, and if other posh people can spot from a mile away, and then he's in his suit, he's in his, but then when he's out for dinner, he's in his like, even hawk suit, which is like, looks perfect. And then he's at an aclimate conference, and he's in this sort of, you know, kind of stealth wealthy thing with a first gila. And it's like, and then he's away and like, willing to include tales at the end. And when he's playing five, he's got his old winches, the shorts on, there's like, loads of specificity in that character, which signals if you know, you know, and even if you don't, they're like, you know, I've seen people know I should I should have spent some more time with Reddit, because it's very bad for your health, especially if you're a show writer TV show. Yeah, especially for you all, I bet there's a lot of really creepy shit. It's all the stuff that we are talking about now, the specificity, somewhere someone has found as pinpointed every single bit of, and that's really graphifying.

It's interesting though, because it doesn't feel like you all drop brand names in the dialogue much. Like the Net-A-Porter thing was funny to me because Net-A-Porter is about to get sold. Its owner, Richemont, has been trying to get rid of it for the last two years. And I think it might have been announced by the time that we do this. They're supposed to announce their new owner, and they're going to have a new business structure. But there was also this looming chance that it might just close. And it was like how hilarious it would have been if it closed before your... But thankfully it didn't. We all love Net-A-Porter. But the point being... You're not free stuff at a port, right? Yes. Mickey Conrad and Laura love free stuff. Please send them stuff. Alison Lownes, I love you. But yes, yes, it's going to be fine. They're going to be great. Everything's okay. Hopefully, let's talk in two weeks. But the point being that it doesn't feel like you... You're not talking about brands a lot or shopping or any of that stuff. Was that specific that you decided not to do that? Or does it just not come up? We did it a lot in the first two seasons. I think that was a function of the fact that we didn't have the partnerships with the brands to be able to actually put them on the actors. So we thought, okay, a shortcut to actually suggest that you're in a world of wealth is to actually say it. So there was... Especially season two, there's references like Laura Piano and the On-Nose and all that stuff. I said in figure three, Laura did just a fantastic job of actually dressing the characters in a way that we didn't actually have to talk about all the time. It was just everything we talked about before, which is all very specific and well thought out. Yeah. Laura, I thought your take on Yasmin and obviously, she's the center in many ways of this season. But I thought your take on her... I noticed a dial-up, a really sharp dial-up. I don't know if that was also a character thing that you all had decided on. But I mean, she's gorgeous. She always looked great. I also thought her hair looked amazing this season. So props to the hair person. Well, man, it looks like a joke. It looks incredible. I'm going to put on my inspo board for my book tour this fall. But it was much more clear to me before she looked like she was wearing sort of the stuff that like a girl who just got a job at one of those companies or a law firm or something that's really pretty would buy. This year, it looked like, oh, this is a person who buys expensive shit. And I don't know if that was a real bag from the real, but it looked like a real Margot bag or whatever. And so I'm just curious, was she a big focus for you all or was there like a specific decision to sort of dial her up in any way? Well, she's actually meant to be kind of hiding this season. I mean, she's one of the things that I had on my boards were sort of references for kind of Italian Jalow horror pictures, because she's kind of in her own awful horror film with what's happened to her with her father. So it was kind of, I don't know, elements of old possession and then sort of very Argento-y kind of like the heroines in those kinds of movies, because there is something kind of horribly filmic about what's happening to her because it's like a wild spiral, but she's kind of visible and invisible. So everything had to be sort of a beautiful silhouette, a really great shape. And Marissa is a very beautiful woman, so that she can put clothes on her and she just wears them so well. So it's, but we were kind of going for shapes like soft knitwear and always kind of had sort of ballet elements that kind of quite fragile. And so they kind of like, she's a sort of ghost in her own life, because she's kind of moving through some of the places that she moved through before, but it was trying to heighten that somehow. And, you know, going for like lighter weight fabrics. So there's kind of quite a lot of, she wears quite a lot of kind of John Smedley pieces, which are very beautiful, luxe knitwear, but it's still very work wear as well. It was just trying not to draw attention to her. So giving her great accessories. So we worked with a great brand called Metier and those are some of her bags in the show. I think the upshot of that, which is really nice though, is that she's tried to be invisible, but yet just can't help but be very visible. Yeah, exactly. We wrote in a scene which a part of it was, yeah, which was cut where she's talking about having to sell all her watches, because she talks about selling her Pathleg Nautilus, and she says, I couldn't sell the Cartier and all this stuff just like reflects the fact that she loves being visible at this point, but she told me because she's being handed by the press. But then, I mean, like one of the running jokes of the season is that she's trying to be invisible with this baseball cap, but she's wearing a baseball cap, which is constantly signaling how wealthy she is. This is wearing like Crestmore, Samarit, she's wearing Saint Bart's hat, she's wearing a hat hat that show off her love of the grownies. And like, that just is who she is, and she just can't help it. So I think actually the way the Lord styled her was really, really, was really perfect for that. You'd also scripted that as well. And we talked about is like, I think that we should try and work up some phrases that we can have, we can rotate through those things. So they're all exclusive merch caps. So she can keep rotating these things, so she can just pick them up. And, you know, then there's not any old baseball cap. They are, yeah, totally exclusive. No one could ordinarily get their hands on. Yeah, I was going to ask about the merch. Do you, so you all make that is I know that there have been pure pawn like pure, pure point, right? Sorry, guys, I had three hours of sleep last night. I really have watched every single episode. But I can't remember my own name right now. But I know there were pure point and sweatshirts available on the HBO website at some point, right? Yeah, they are. They're great. Well, now I think they've actually got a new iteration of them. There's a sort of like, buy them. Everyone should buy them. Shit, there's a story about this because obviously it's the in season one, there's this purple hoodie that Eric wears, which is a pretty, it's pretty simple hoodie. I think we in Conrad designed it on the train. And it had just supposed to be like his merch from his offside management, like bonding session. And it's just purple, the pure point logo and offside management offside on the back. For some reason, it took off and people thought it was the height of you know, if you know, you know, because this is the show that Noah was watching. Very, very. I was watching. You were watching. Thank you, Lauren. You were watching. But then people just cottoned on that there was this hoodie in it. And then Virgil Abloh put it up on his Instagram. And suddenly people already thought this was a really cool thing. And Virgil, I mean, like he wanted to do a whole line for off white with this hoodie. And he said, you know, him or one of his collaborators do these amazing drawings. And unfortunately, you know, it was just before he passed away, but for should be we couldn't make it work. But then HBO released the first version of the hoodie. And it was just like it was a hoodie, but had like a bigger HBO logo. I think actually they've they've made they've changed that now, because they just end up with the logo on the back. I think they need to put their logo on it for it to be an HBO product. But yeah, so but it is available to purchase. They need to make all of that stuff. They should make Yasmin's hats. People will buy it buy it. But so like, how do you guys do that? Do you have Laura, do you have like a supplier in the UK? Is it just like Zazzle? Or is it a more complicated process? It's a bit more complicated. I have a friend who's a graphic designer. And I've worked with her on a lot of previous projects. And then we had somebody in the house in on the who was on the team anyway. And they did some graphic work for us involving the cuff links for Eric, but then for those caps, and named Anna Hague, and we were sort of working together on creating the graphics and what to do with those. So that's the sort of you obviously saw you saw the cap. And then you get that embroidered. But it was yeah, it's very fun to do. And Mickey and Conrad came up with these really fun phrases. So it's like, just create imagery around that that will work. So we kind of had a selection, and then created the best ones from those. And now I didn't for me and Mickey, it's quite an expression of our creativity. Like a lot of people, it's not, you know, like a lot of people talk about the ADR in the show, like why is the background dialogue so good compared to the foreground dialogue. And often it's because we're not thinking about it as much. And it's just more of a creative impulse with some of the clones. It's exactly the same thing. Like me and Mickey will ride the scene, or set the scene, all the story points and character points will be here. We got in the right location. And then we'll think literally the 11th hour, like why doesn't this person wear a Bear Stearns t-shirt? Or like why don't I wear a Lehman Brothers t-shirt? And it's like, it's immediately for us, it's like a way of making the scene 10%, 20% more funny. Like if Jesse Bloem in season two is talking about something collapsing and he's doing a Lehman Brothers t-shirt, oh my god, the whole scene has an irony that it didn't previously have. So it's like, it's just another expression of our creativity. And Laura was very Laura, obviously, out of her own pitch and stuff. It was just incredibly good at like us giving her something at the 11th hour and then coming back the best version of it. Yeah, there were a lot of sort of like, I wouldn't call them visual jokes, but there are a lot of visuals that you can kind of the MK sort of talk about. And then you go, okay, yeah, let's make that happen and make it, yeah, like Conrad said, it just adds to the picture. Like, you know, you want to look at something beautiful and interesting and engaging. And that's what, you know, my job is to make be part of that and do the best that I can do in that scenario. If you all for next season would like to borrow our giant Enron mug, your it's available to you. Wow. It's like a clear plastic giant mug.

This is kind of a, I guess, a little more philosophical question. But why do you all think that the fashion industry has or like fashion editors and writers have glommed on to the show? Like I had no idea because it dropped in like the first season was the height of the pandemic, right? Yeah. It was like August 2020 or 2021. Now it was 2020, November 2020. Oh, November 2020. So I was like two months pregnant and living in it. Like it was just, I didn't, we didn't share it with anyone. So it was like a very isolated experience. But then more people I talked to, the more people I realized that my friends watch it and really like it, the clothes are very cool, but it's not, it's not like a fashion show. If you know what I mean. Like it feels like real clothes that people would wear and it's not like put on or it's not the big conversation at the end of the episode is like what people were wearing. It's more about what they did. Whereas like other shows that are great. It was just much more, I don't know, it's interesting because it seems to be a lot of fashion fans, but it's not like that's the lead, the leading thing people are talking about. I'm curious, as people who are interested in fashion and like fashion and are enthusiasts, like why you think that industry has been attracted to this industry? I think kind of to go back to the point you made earlier about everyone feeling they've been individually dressed and not just feeling that there's sort of this, as I guess I said before, but like it's kind of quite bland, kind of sort of dark suits. I think it's the specificity again, which makes people think that it's, it's dealing with clothes in an interesting way and they are actually revealing character. I'd say I'm not going to down a great other show set in finance or in the business world, but like, I mean, in the, I mean, I think, you know, the shows are succession to a very, very well as well, but like in the old days, I'd say like a show like suits, like I don't see no many lawyers like I think it's just like, we're going to make everyone look really good. And I have this really like thin skinny silhouette, so pretty much everyone that's small ties and it's going to feel like everyone's kind of wearing the same thing. They all look like they kind of like fashion-y people at work rather than actual people who have dressed themselves, who are trying to make themselves look good. And I think I'll show, like, it showed how people actually dressed where they stayed in a contemporary way and what they were wearing to get how they could express themselves and how important they felt they are via their clothes. I mean, that's really, that's really how people are dressed in finance or they did only spend me a contract work. You kind of like, you know, you'd be wearing an ad-nails or a pair of gamma attire because you know, it's good. You're gonna say something about you. I'm gonna wear like, like, you know, really expensive like Keats church is like that's gonna put me above someone else's go the leg lift is like, that's the way people think about it. And it's all this like signifying her hierarchy. They signifies a higher. They're telling you also two factors have nothing to do with clothes, which is like, why people adopted it. The first one being that I think there's a kind of an analogy between workplaces that they feel just the idea of hierarchical structure, people at the bottom of it, people at the top of it, people being shattered by people at the top of it, the idea of like, constant like, wanting to secure the next stage of your career. And the idea of the bottom rung being the rung that's abused, I think is very, very common in the fashion world as much as in the finance world. And then I think it's just a function of like, the not to put like, to a higher point on it. And I'm not trying to like express say this in expression, mine and Nikki's taste. But I think people thought the show was tasteful from season one, like they, they listened to the sonic, like they listened to the music choices, they listened to the overall sonic palette. I think the music was a huge part of the show show success in season one. And people thinking, oh, whatever is behind this sort of punky aesthetic and this kind of weird show about people like a group of actors that I've never seen before, there's a kind of hand that's guiding it, which feels like it has a little bit of some sort of expression of taste or whatever that is. And I think that maybe that's kind of why people thought it was a more tasteful show than necessarily mine and Nikki's dress. It did remind me the first season, especially of the first newsroom I ever worked in, like a very similar vibe. Everybody's crazy. Everybody's going out all the time. Everybody's working all the time. Everyone's intermingling and in it, and those the dynamics between the different characters felt very true to like a newsroom in 2004. I don't think now it's a little different how journalism operates. But yeah, that all, that all makes a lot of sense. I mean, I'm curious, like, what are you guys into right now fashion wise? Like, what are you wearing? What brands? What show do you want to be invited to this season? Like, if I can help, I will. Yeah, the first time we ever beat one week, we went to the top four one in Milan last year because Nathan, the composer of our show, a dude of music, and it was nice. The thing that I was struck by the most is how short it was. Oh, yeah. Well, I went to the Ralph Lauren show last night. That one was not short. Oh, really? I tried it. Yeah, I was just, I mean, I love it. God bless them. But it was a long show. Yeah, the weather, Prada, I guess, but a girl I like to take her. These are not actually clothes that we I necessarily wear because they're, they're slightly out by price point. And I don't really like buying first hand clothes from high end places. Because it's a bit like buying a car straight off a lot. You kind of like, you can feel the value decrease the moment you take out the shop. Me and Mick talk about fashion a lot. Like, Mick, what do you like to wear? You like to wear like home, plus saying stuff like that. You tend to have a uniform, which I think is really quite good because it means you don't really think about it all that much. Yeah, that's true. I've got like this code behind me has like maybe 30 different isimiac things that all the pretty much exactly the same. It can be both smart and they can also be pajamas that I could wear around London. So yeah, I think I comfort is something I actually think about more than like I did in the past. Because probably because I'm getting older. Yeah, I don't want to reveal my sources, but I'm meeting with one of the brands that you said today and I'm going to float that they should invite you guys. 100% we'll go. I think that's they're very fun. We had an amazingly good time of the land. As Mick, he says we're out in and out in seven minutes so we could go and have a nice night. Yeah, they're not all like that. That show is also run by the PR firm KCD. And they're the most efficient PR firm to do front of house for a fashion show. So when you go, they know who everyone is, you don't have to wait in line, they pull you, you don't have to like deal with stupid stuff like check in at the front. And they're very good. They're very on time really quick, like the most professional of those types of agencies. So you got lucky, they're not all like that. You could be sitting there for an hour. I'm fascinated. I'm fascinated by anywhere in the modern world where you can like feel hierarchy. The moment you walk through a door and never in my life have I been made, and never in my life is the stratification of people more obvious than I know one of those things. It's kind of amazing how people talk, especially like me and Mickey where people didn't really know who we were. It was like kind of amazing where we got pert and how we would deal with compared to like all the Korean influences and stuff. It's fascinating. Laura, are you into labels or are you like wearing obscure stuff that none of us have heard of that's like very cool and utilitarian? Oh yeah, all the time. Now I am wearing a t-shirt I really love, which is by Sportsbanger and I really like it a lot. It's a Nike NHS matchup, which I think is quite funny. I know it's not just those. Yeah, I like lots of different stuff. I mean, in terms of shows, I would love to have gone to the Margella, John Galliano show because that looked amazing just for the effect. The actuality was phenomenal and the makeup. It was like the whole world that he created was amazing, really beautiful. And yeah, that's a one that I have FOMO for sure. Too bad. But you can't go to every fashion week. That's the issue. So we're, this is going to run a couple days before the penultimate episode. Is there anything that the fashion people, followers should be looking out for style wise? Like is there going to be any change or any indication or anything that like any hints or Easter eggs you can, you can tease? There's a time jump. There's quite a significant time jump near to the end of the season and people look different as a result of it and feel different. And they're actually great examples of how styling, makeup, hair and flaring actually set a time jump and a jumping character without actually having to stick to that atmosphere. Yeah. Yeah. So great point. How was that for you Laura? Was that fun to do? Really fun to do because it was there were just elements for like Harper, Yasmin and Robert that were brilliant to kind of bring out finally for them. So Robert's character for the first time, we really see him outside Peer Point in a non sort of banking way. So it was being able to put him some of those brands like Stone Island. That was really fun. And then Yasmin sort of becomes more herself suddenly. There's a kind of G.L.A. story in the last, I mean, there's so many different elements in the last two episodes that are just different sort of stylistic play things. You know, the Sweet Pea has her own like what a way to go story, which is sort of one of her references. Amazing. Yeah. It was really fun. She's got a good, yeah, Shirley, Shirley MacLean inspired looking that. So yeah. What a breakout hit is Sweet Pea. Finally, I know you all are in the middle of this breakout hit. But have you ever thought about doing a show about the fashion industry because no one's gotten it right? And I feel like you guys could do it. I'm re-watching How to Make it in America now and absolutely loving it. That's such a good one. I think the fact it was counted off the two seasons probably isn't a great, but great that I did a fashion TV shows will do. But I guess Emily Parris is a fashion show. Oh yeah. But they don't, I have issues with the how they, how they depict it. But no one's like really nailed it. I think they do a great job at depicting an annoying social media person. Exactly correct. I think as an industry, I think the best person to write that would be someone that's lived there or has a first hand, can do a first hand account of it. Because I think like the specificity of that world, I mean, it's, I think it's to do it without someone who actually lived there would make it feel like a caricature. And that's the biggest, you know, that's kind of the biggest obstacle to making something in that world. It's a bit like writing something to do the art of all. It's like it's very, very close to parody with thunder all the time. Yeah. That's Jimmy and Larry's cute to fire up, find a draft and get writing. 100%. They better give us a commission if they get a development deal or whatever they're called. Guys, thank you so much for taking the time. This was really fun. Thank you. Thanks, Erdyn. Thanks so much. Good to meet you, Lauren. Thanks so much, Lauren. Fashion people is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck, hosted by Lauren Sherman. That's me.
