I am joined for this upfront segment today by a very special guest, the one and only Dan Fromer, publisher of the new consumer. Dan, welcome to Fashion People. Thank you and honored to be on my favorite podcast. A quick disclosure, Dan is also my husband. We've known each other for a really long time and we actually started working together. Our working lives have intersected for many years. We used to actually do a podcast together. Do you remember? For many years, yes. Of course. No one looked it up. No one looked it up. I think I stopped paying the hosting bill, so hopefully it's gone. Oh, that's kind of sad. Remember when Squarespace was our advertiser and we were really proud? It was amazing. It was. It was a great moment in our lives. True legitimacy. Anyway, I wanted to have you on really quickly this week to talk about this annual report you do about consumer trends. Sarah Shapiro wrote about this for Line Sheet on Thursday, so everyone should check out. She pulled out the Line Sheet adjacent information, but you gave me a little preview earlier in the week of what was going to be in the report. Yes, to start, tell me about the consumer trends report, how you put it together and what the big idea is. This is the 11th report I've done over the last five years with a venture firm in New York called Coefficient Capital. It's a collaboration between them and me, the new consumer. We're fascinated by huge shifts in the consumer, whether it is spending behavior, shopping in different channels, sentiment, and how they think about their personal finances or how they think about things that are happening in business and society. We started this report in 2020 when every chart looked absolutely crazy. In fact, this report starts with a little bit of a retrospective going back to five years and what's back to normal now, e-commerce spending. Remember that crazy chart of how all the money went online and then went back away? We're actually back at that COVID level now of e-commerce. In fact, e-commerce spending has doubled in five years, more than doubled. We always look at a bunch of different topics, things that we think are growing, that are going to matter for the future, things like TikTok shop and a bunch of other topics in this report. Okay. Explain to me what happened with e-commerce because I noticed this during Black Friday day where the sales in store were essentially flat and they were busy, but I think people just didn't want to sit in traffic or try to get into these crowded parking lots, which are really scary on those types of busy shopping days. But e-commerce sales were up 15% or something like that. They increased dramatically. What's going on that online spending is picking up so much again because people are out and about. It's not like they're sitting at home. Yeah. E-commerce up in the US 10% on Black Friday and 9% for the whole online shopping season through early December, according to Adobe. I mean, I think a couple of things are happening. One is just it's a lot more convenient to shop online. I think the bigger thing that's happening is there's just profound discounting. It's much cheaper to shop online. It feels at least much cheaper to shop online than it does. In a store, the discounts are in your face directly in your email or sometimes via text. A huge growth in online shopping is mobile shopping. Another thing is buy and out pay later, which is a lot easier to do online than in the store. So it's a little less fun. You and I love going shopping in stores, although we probably do most of our buying online. Yeah, but we don't go shopping in stores at home. It's true. Well, part of that is the quality. Of the stores at home. Well, that's true. But that's the thing. Most people don't live in New York or Paris or London and we travel a lot and you're going to Tokyo next week. What do you do in Tokyo? There's nothing else to do but shopping. Just shopping, coffee and shopping. This is part of our professional lives. Generally, though, I don't want to go to the Americana at 5.30 on a Saturday when it's a clusterfuck. I don't want to get in a car accident in a parking lot. That does not seem like a good place to have a car accident. I don't know about you, but that's not my ideal. Agreed. Especially with that new big car that you just got. So let's talk about some of the other trends. The other big thing is TikTok, which obviously in the last two weeks, there has been a lot of reporting about the potential TikTok fan. They have told January 19th to sell it to, I guess, an entity outside of China. I don't know if it has to be an American company or not that buys it, but I assume there will be some sort of deal that happens before January 19th, but it's a sort of wait-and-see situation at the moment. What did you find out about TikTok shops that surprised you? TikTok shop launched, which is their in-app shopping, launched September 2023. So it's not even two years old. What's going on there? Yeah, so three kind of mind-blowing things about TikTok. One is, and we kind of feel this, but to see it in data is to really comprehend. We asked our survey panel, part of our work is we do a survey of over 3,000 Americans. It's designed to be a nationally representative survey. Among people who know about TikTok, more than 60% of Gen Z say they use it every single day. So this is something that is just built into young people's lives in America. And so that, I think, is, and this story, we've talked about content to commerce for, I don't know, what, 20 years that we've known each other. This is a massive content to commerce success. This is integrating a digital storefront into a wildly popular entertainment platform, and it has worked. A year ago, we did some research on TikTok shop and said, I don't know if this is going to continue. People are spending some money here. They're buying goofy novelties that their favorite creators are arguing about. Is this actually going to keep growing? It's more than double year over year. And if you look at the credit card spending panel data that I have in the consumer trends report, TikTok shop in Q3 was bigger than Sheehan, was bigger than Sephora, and was way bigger than old school home shopping among US credit and debit card accounts. So in less than a year and a half, it is now a larger business than Sephora, which is absolutely wild. And then the third thing is, you mentioned the ban. The number one reason people told us they haven't shopped on TikTok shop is trust issues. They don't trust TikTok with their credit card number. They don't trust the quality of the products. They don't really trust TikTok. Another wild data point was that almost 40% of Americans think that the Chinese government is using TikTok, specifically its content algorithm, to make Americans feel more socially and politically divided. Even among people who use TikTok every single day, less than half of them told us, no, we don't think China is doing this. So there's a lot of cynicism and a lot of mistrust around the TikTok ecosystem. But somehow it has built this massive business about people buying cheap stuff, $8 workout clothes, $11 viral hairbrushes. And it's just become so huge that it's almost unfathomable how fast it's going. Yeah, we did buy that hair. I did buy that hairbrush. We did. I forgot about that. Yeah. It was fine. I don't even think I have it anymore. No, it's long gone. I wonder what happened to it. Okay. So do you think that this, what do you, because we do talk about this content to commerce thing a lot. It doesn't normally work because there are various reasons why. But I think mostly because when you try to get someone to read something and then buy something, no one wants to read anything. But the video stuff doesn't always work either. On YouTube, it seems to really work. If a YouTube creator starts, does a merch shop or something, that becomes successful, et cetera. I think the company that owns the Holdco, that owns Starface is interesting. The way they do content to commerce, I've talked to a couple of the people who manage those specific businesses, like Overdrive, their new business. And they are really interested, the way they manage it is interesting from a legitimate product brand maker. But do you think the reason it's been so successful is because it takes like what makes the potency of QVC or home shopping network and applies it to Amazon marketplace, essentially? I think there's a level of shamelessness that TikTok has crossed that Instagram or YouTube won't, which is they really just cram the shop in your face. You can't miss it. And they really incentivize their, I hate the word creators, but their creators to make videos about these products and generate controversy. And one of the craziest things about TikTok shop is you can see the unit sales of every single product. So you can see a huge brand. I won't name any blue chip brands on here that have sold like, I don't know, 5,000 units. Why? You can name one. I just don't remember. I got to look it up. But then you see that almost half a million people have bought this cheap teeth whitening kit TikTok shop or 2 million people have bought this kind of no name shape wear brand. So I think some of it is it's the kind of stuff that organically would perform well on TikTok. Like, oh, this is too good to believe. This is too cheap to believe. Plus just the shamelessness of TikTok to just shove it in your face. They've also heavily subsidized it. They're discounting like crazy. That's something I haven't yet been able to measure. But if you're a data provider and you can tell me the discounts that TikTok is providing on each order, get in touch. But it's a totally different world than something that Instagram would be comfortable. I'm sure Instagram looks at TikTok, she goes, this is wild. We would never do something like this. I mean, who knows? Who knows what will happen in two months? They might have to someday. Really quickly because we don't have much time. What's going on with OZempic? What's the latest? Because you always have a lot of OZempic or GLP1 data. Yeah. We'll probably have more for our spring report on food and wellness. One thing that was interesting, there's this narrative that alcohol is on its way out and it's just not true. Most people plan to drink the same amount that they were drinking before. Booze is not cigarettes. Cigarettes consumption has gone way down in America, but alcohol has been actually very steady. The non-alcohol substitutes are just super niche right now. Younger consumers are more interested in them, but it's just not that big of a thing. What was interesting is one of the groups that said they plan to drink more next year in our survey were people who say they're also on GLP1s because got to get out to the bar and get drinking while we looked this good. But the thing is, when you're on them, you supposedly A, don't have any desire to drink and B, are not like, I don't think you're supposed to drink a lot when you're on them because they probably affect your liver and kidney and all that stuff. Yeah. And of course, there's a disconnect between what people say they want to do or plan to do and actually do it. So yes, in a lot of other studies, you've seen GLP1 users actually do cut back on drinking, but more of them intend to drink more next year than the average person, at least in our survey. One theory, I did speak to one person who's been on them for a long time and is in maintenance phase. And they told me that they can drink now and enjoy it. I think at the beginning, when you're on it, if you're on it, if a really intense dose, you can't. But maybe you... So that's an interesting point. Okay. Well, interesting. I guess no dry January. Something like 22% of drinkers say they plan to have zero drinks in January. About half of Americans know what dry January is, much higher among rich people, though, than the average. Yeah, I bet it is. It is. You know what I do. I drink sugar January, which is super fun for everyone. Actually, prior healthier. 107 slides, newconsumer.com, slash trends. Get it. You're too good. Thanks, Dan. Thank you. Yen's greed. Welcome to fashion, people. Thank you so much for having me. I'm so excited to be with you today. What'd you have for breakfast this morning? I have the same breakfast. I think I've had the same breakfast for probably seven or eight years. It's a smoothie. I have half a banana, half an avocado, spinach, mint, various powders, creatine, protein, and that's it. That makes me feel great. I feel like creatine is the trendy powder of the moment for women in particular. It makes us look good, but it has some real cognitive benefits too. I don't really do smoothies, but it apparently helps with muscle recovery or something? It helps with muscle recovery for sure. If you work out, you'll find you'll have a bit more strength during your workouts. The reason I take creatine really is for cognitive health. Your sleep deprived, let's say, and I have four children, so there's moments when I am. Creatine really helps you function a lot better with less sleep. There's a lot of evidence pointing to that really helps with cognitive health as we get older, which we don't want to be. We don't want to get older. Creatine me up. I remember I had a friend who was in college when I was in high school whose boyfriend used to take it because he wanted to get more muscles and he thought it would help him. But it didn't work. Come on. If you can, if you can have more muscles and better cognitive health, I think it's a pretty good supplement. I like smoothies because it's hard to consume all the stuff that we need to consume that's good for us in pill form. It's just an easy way to access all of that. I get on with the rest of my day. I agree. I'm going to start taking creatine and I will report back to the fashion people listeners how it goes. Not sleeping thing. I'm pretty good about sleep, but when you're really busy, I only have one child. I don't have four. It does make it hard to sleep seven or eight, which is what I try to do normally. So that's a really good point. So you're shifting time zones. It really helps. And I think there's a few things we can do to help our brain stay healthy through periods of sleep deprivation. And I think it's incredibly, incredibly important. We function so much worse when we don't have quality sleep. That's true. Speaking of time zones, where are you right now? Are you in New York or Los Angeles? I'm in Hollywood, California, at my office. Are your offices are in Hollywood? I'm a trailblazer. I guess so. And are you going to New York this week for the store opening, the skin store opening? Yeah, I'll go tomorrow morning. And the store opening is Thursday. But today we're of course dropping the North Bay Skin collab. So I've heard it's pretty wild at the stores right now. I think it's crazy traffic this morning. How do you manage that type of collaboration drop online? When you all first started, I mean, you had done e-commerce sites prior to skins, obviously. But I remember those first few drops and stuff would sell out in what, an hour or something. How do you manage the traffic to the website so it doesn't crash? Is that a big challenge for you all? Or are we in a post-crash world because of technology advances? No, sites can crash. It can for sure crash, that happens. It's normally a technical oversight. And if you haven't prepared your partners for the search and demand, I mean, this morning we decided not to crash. We were well prepared for it. But the whole collaboration sold out in about, I think, 10 minutes. It was like something I've never seen before. We had almost 200,000 people on waitlist as of last night. And it just went. How much of that is you being conservative about the order and how much of that was in this case like you didn't expect the demand to be that high? I mean, it's a combination of a number of things. It is, you know, how much inventory can you get, right? I think customers don't see how actually part of it to manufacture excellent product in a somewhat timely fashion and getting that into a warehouse. So it depends when those conversations start, how much inventory we can actually get. We were very inventory constrained for this collaboration. So that's one part. The other thing is for collaborations, you want them to be special. You're not trying to buy so you just have infinite amounts of product because it kind of dilutes the specialness of the moment. And lastly, very hard to know what customers will think. We think of these things, you know, a year or so before they come out and it's hard to anticipate the mood the year from today. And we've had a, I would say, pretty warm fall and early winter until now. So I think people were finally very excited about, you know, buying winter gear. So I think all of those things kind of pay in. But also I think the execution of the product, the campaign around it, the moment right now, it just created a demand that was four or five times higher than you could ever have anticipated. It really took me by surprise. When you do a collaboration like this is because the North Face is the technical brand, are they the ones doing the manufacturing? How do you manage that? Because I assume when you do a collaboration on underwear or something, that's probably you all in your factories. But in this case, would it be their factories or is it a mix of both? How do you manage the manufacturing for something like this? It's normally a mix of both. I would say it was the Dolce or Fendi back in the day. It depends to be who can make what thing at the right quality and price in time. It's not like just one partner does everything, a true collaboration. You know, the nature of it is that you are allowed, as a brand, you can do something that you wouldn't normally do yourself. So you have larger creative freedom to expand, you know, what customers is expecting from you and it should be fun and innovative. So both brands really want to do something they don't normally do. So you kind of use each other's strengths. And that goes from a factory base, but I think it's equally true for design and marketing. How did this come together? Was it something that you all thought, I mean, I thought that the campaign was brilliant and looked so good. And that, I mean, first and foremost, it looked great, but also traveled and people were excited about it. But like, where did this idea in particular come from? And then you pulled in Vanessa Beerkroft and the North Face itself. Obviously, they've done a lot of great collaborations, but you have to have their buy-in and your buy-in. How do you make something like this work? Having most great collaborations start organically through a conversation between principals. Kim has been wearing North Face for as long as I've known her and she has been tailoring her North Face jackets for as long as I've known her. So I think we approached the North Face about this several years ago. And then, you know, I can't really say the moment it turned like we're doing it. I think over time, it kind of just like we're doing it. But yeah, it's a conversation that I think first happened a couple of years ago. It was not overnight. It took us a while before we actually pressed play. But yeah, no, it really started organically with that's something we were all wearing and we contacted them and said, we have this way of wearing North Face and customizing North Face and we'd love to skim-sefy that. So one of the reasons I was excited to have you on here is you, to me, have a very unique approach to retail and branding that is defining this era of the mall or whatever, the conceptual mall that lives in our heads. And something I think you have in common with a lot of your predecessors is this ability to sort of latch onto a cultural moment or make a cultural moment and make it feel like the product you're making is embedded in that moment. And this thing with the North Face, like an algorithm could have spit out that you all should do this. But the Kim tailoring her North Face jackets is why it's going to be successful. You could have just done a bunch of North Face stuff in skim's colors, but it wouldn't be enough. Maybe we can go back a little bit to how you got started in this business to sort of explain like how you get to this point when you execute something that is so on point sells out more quickly than you could have ever imagined and sort of exemplifies why skim's in particular is best in class, but why you generally have had so much success in the world of retail. Well I've been in the fashion industry my whole life and I started as a journey at the age of 19 and then through the wallpaper group, then I started my own agency with my best friend Eric that grew into something called the Saturday group and you had to be around a long time to remember the Saturday group. But it was really the first kind of fashion marketing PR entertainment group of scale and it was a real scale. And some of those companies that we either created or co-founded or invested in or back, they are still around today and incredibly successful businesses like Tomorrow or agencies like General Idea or the Wednesday group. And I really spent the first 15 years of my career building this group and as an image maker working with the greatest not just designers but also entrepreneurs and leaders of the fashion industry. And at some point in my early 30s or mid 30s I felt I rather be like the people I work for rather than just service them and that led me to ultimately we sold the Saturday group and it was a large business at the time and we sold it to Omnicom and we sold it to the public group and private equity and we dismantled this first chapter very successfully and I decided to focus on being a brand owner and brand builder myself and it started with Erick and I creating this company called Frame that we still own to this day and of course later on partnering with Kim to create skims amongst many other things that we've been involved with directly or indirectly over the past. So when you moved from being a marketer and a person who helped create brand images into creating a brand yourself that obviously that the marketing is a piece of it. What did you learn in those early days of Frame about because Frame is hugely successful denim and now lifestyle brand that continues to grow and have different iterations. A lot of those denim brands that launched around the time Frame launched what 2012, 2013 they don't exist anymore. What did you learn in those early days that you feel like are the foundation of what you do now? I think I learned from Rema Ruffini who is the CEO of Montclair and bought that brand when it was long forgotten but it had been a popular brand both in the 70s and 80s and he bought it at the low and he's created a global powerhouse in Montclair over the past 20 years. What I saw in Rema Ruffini he took this performance led product and he really attached it to the values of the fashion industry in design in terms of how you build stores, how you create excitement and theater in those stores around the product. I saw how he brought in designers like Pishi and created a way of doing fashion in winter kind of redefining that category. I was very inspired by it and if it wasn't for Rema I don't think I would have started Frame because I looked at the denim category and Eric and I really pursued something similar. We had lived and worked in the fashion industry our whole lives. I can't even remember when I met you first Lauren but it must have been a very long time ago in a totally different lifetime. That was our world. When we started Frame we attached it to the people that we knew, the people that surrounded us and we connected this brand to the fashion industry at large. I think many of the same principle applies to skims. It's a very technical product, it's a category of product and we tried to reinvent the category for product design for innovation but also through the theater of retail and attaching it to both fashion and popular culture. One thing that I remember from the early Frame days is you did a jean with Carly Clarks, correct? Did you learn anything about the power of personality and celebrity that turned you on to partnering with big names to launch brands because you've done that so many times? No. No, that's a better answer. I'll tell you first of all, I love Carly. She was a defining factory in the early days of the success around Frame that was just something that hadn't been done in that category. So it was incredibly important for us and we're so grateful to Carly for doing it. Again, that was entirely organic, something that came up at dinner once. Eric asked, Carly, why don't you wear our brand that she said, they don't really fit me. He was like, well, let's just make them fit you and then out of that collaboration. Again, I come back to the same thing which is great things happen organically and you kind of feel like a consumer when it's fake. When it has sense of authenticity, it tends to resonate with people. Coming back to the idea of quote unquote celebrity brands, I really don't like the idea of celebrity brands. To me, it's things of the fragrance shelf at CVS. That's the smell that I have in my nose when someone says it. Because what I recognize, brother, is the shift in our culture. If you look at our most successful designers, on Ford, Demna or Heady, they're all celebrities. Ford put himself in his own campaigns. They are designers, but they're also multidisciplinary creatives. Mary, Kate and Ashley are also celebrities. They're also multidisciplinary creatives. So is Travis Scott and so is Kim Kardashian. We all start doing things and then through our creative journey, we develop. If I look at San Ra, San Ra's celebrity brand, I mean, it uses Hollywood all the time. It has had famous designers who's in popular culture. It dresses stars. I would say that San Ra, when it's a Burberry or whatever, is far more of a celebrity affiliated than the Rose. And I don't think anyone buys the rose because they love to watch Fuller House. No, but they do love Full House. Have you ever watched it? I actually used to watch Fuller House when I was a kid. And I do actually, I love it. Me too. I'm obsessed. But what I think it comes down to is that I think brands have, some have more integrity, some brands have less integrity. And that's really the red line. Travis Scott has a lot of integrity in his process. It doesn't matter where he comes from. He has a lot of integrity in his process. It doesn't really matter what the story is about. So for me, I think it's about integrity and fame. I think generally is really a poor thing to trade because if celebrity could simply sell anything and that is a gross simplification, everybody would like to, you know, or let's say, confusion people like to get to. Well, if so, celebrities would really dictate the outcome of our elections and we all know they don't, right? Well, arguably they did because Donald Trump is also a celebrity. But I know, I know what you mean. Yes. Yeah. If they, if they could influence more celebrities, endorse the Kamala. Yeah. And it's like every brand that worked with big celebrity would turn around their fortunes and all of these brands that celebrity has dreamt up over the years would all be successful. And I just don't think consumers are that stupid. I think just because you love someone's voice or acting ability, I don't think that means you love their yoga leggings or cold brew. So I think it's a simplification and I think the cultures move past it. And I think we look at things that are created with integrity and a person, a known person can have more integrity in their creative process than a corporate entity, which sitting in strategy meetings and trying to figure out what consumers would like through algorithms research data. I don't think that's any more pure, you know, just because there isn't a person behind it. In fact, I think people today like to understand that there is a person behind it and that person has appointed you that they're trying to bring out. So that, that makes sense to me and you're using the word integrity. The thing about you that I've been trying to figure out is like, what is your pattern? Like all investors, all brand builders, people who own, like if you look at like a Les Wexner or a Mickey Drexler or people who kind of came several generations before you, but what made them successful, they had a particular way of doing things. And so the thing that you tend to identify is like the way Les Wexner worked is that he looked at trends in the market and was able to quickly adapt them for the masses. So like he looked at trends in the sort of advanced consumer market. If he went on a trip to Europe, everyone was wearing butter yellow. He bought a bunch of that stuff, came back and told his team, we need to make a bunch of stuff in butter yellow. And that was in the 80s, the way to turn it. But you're saying your sort of method of identifying what the culture wants is looking for people who can bring integrity to a product. And, and that is what resonates today. Yeah, I look for a, an aesthetic and a worldview that I can help make a better business. And I saw that in him. I see that in Eric. I have saw the same thing in Greg with the elder statement and aesthetic that doesn't look like anything else. And that's honestly what gets me excited. I get incredibly excited. I can't help myself, but then get involved. And I see an aesthetic that I just can't place anywhere else. I hope to be involved with brands that when you look at it across the board at the span of my career, they are, you know, they are easily distinguishable. They are perfect for what they are. Right. And no one else had exactly that point of view. And I think that when we came out with skims, it was a different point of view on a category. It was a different way to, to market and build that category. It was a different view of product. I was extremely excited about helping Kim make that vision a reality. And I'm equally excited now a week after we opened the first elder statement flagship in New York to help build an American luxury brand that has this tension between Malibu Surfer and cashmere and luxury and Americana and we're opening actually another store for elder tomorrow in Aspen. And so I'm equally excited about that. I just, I get excited about creativity. But the, going back to the last Wexner, I think that was a very different era where information was very hard to come by. And some of these retailers, they, they were able to build this format. And it was like a way of educating the customer regionally through the malls about what was happening in the world. I don't think that's placed apart anymore because we all have access to the same information at the same time. And I think Mickey Drexler is an unbelievable merchant and perhaps closer, a little bit closer to how I work because I feel that Mickey is a great customer of his own brand. And that's really the key to everything I do. And I preach it all the time, which is I tell people, stop thinking like a company. Like just tell everybody that works for you not to think like a company. The company and the customer are not the same thing. You are, as long as you think like a customer, and I try to push everybody to go after things that gets us excited. So going back to the North Face, we wanted to make North Face Jacket. We're excited about it. We're the customer of what we are making. And if you love what you do, chances are someone else will love it too. But I can't stand this kind of over strategizing, trying to figure out what someone else would want separate from what you want. I'd say to everybody all the time, what do you want to pay for? Will you buy this if you didn't work here? Will you pay this for it? Would you know about it? And I think that goes from adult shade to a North Face. I think that goes from do I want to see Lana Del Rey at Valentine, etc. Everything we do is that are we excited about doing this? Are we excited about seeing it? Am I excited about buying it? And I think businesses where we all feel like we're the customer and we act like we're the customer and we create it for ourselves, it tends to be well. And if you don't do well, at least you love it. The process of accepting insurance outside of a group practice can be tough.

I mean, like founder mode, trying to turn micro managing into something like sexy. No, I think there's... No, I mean, I think micro managing can be very helpful. It can slow things down, but it can also keep the quality up if you do it in the right way, if you optimize it. No, I'm not a micro manager. The speech I give every single person who works directly for me is that I'm a basketball coach. And I'm going to put my starting five on the floor, but you can't count on me running in and sinking it free in the fourth quarter, but I'm going to deal with you in the off-season. So I spend most of my time trying to build a team of people that are as like-minded and competitive as I am, but hopefully better at the individual tasks than I would have. I want to talk a bit about product itself. Quickly, how much do you think you work with your wife, Emma, who helps run skims with you, also CEO, right of Good American? You have your investors and Greg Chaitz, elder statesman, as you mentioned. You all are still connected to frame. Do you think that having Emma, because I've interviewed both of you, I've written about your relationship, do you think that having that person who is your life partner and someone you trust implicitly partnering with you on all this stuff, do you think that that is a big- I mean, obviously it's a key to your success, but do you think that's like super charged? You all being able to work with so many different creative people. Like you work with Kim Kardashian, you work with Greg, you work with Eric, all these different people, and it does feel like a real potent- like concentrated power between the two of you because you work so closely together. I'd say that all of the people you just mentioned have been friends first. Eric is my best friend in the whole world. I'm both father to children, he's both father to mine. I couldn't dream of not having him in my life, both as a friend and as a business partner. When it comes to our spouse, I mean, we all work with our partners. I'm lucky enough not to have to do too much of the who's picking up Sunny and bringing out the trash. There's a lot of everyday things that we don't have to work out to see. That's because we're fortunate to have a lot of great help around us. But so we all work with our partners. I think that Emma is an exceptional merchant and I think she's exceptional pretty much every single way. I'm very lucky to be married to her. I'm very happy to be working with her. There are elements of our work which overlap. I think we have really, I think the key to our working relationship has been that we have defined roles. But I would say the same thing about Eric and I would say the same thing about Kim. I think that there is aspects where Kim, whatever Kim says goes and there's aspects where she would defer to me. I'd say the same thing about Eric. I think I've been lucky working with friends where we have clear lines of responsibility and I think that's been a key. I don't think my relationship with Emma is that different as a work relationship to my relationship with my other partners. I think we've been lucky to treat outside of work and work differently. Keep that in mind. Yeah. Well, I think you also, there's something about, and you and Eric started work, Eric Torrancem, by the way. I was called out by a reader that, a listener, that I never say the person's last name. We just talk about people like everyone should know and I'm sure everyone does know Eric, but Eric Torrancem, you all started working together first, correct? I was 21 years old. I do think there is something about a relationship and you also worked with Emma and I started, I met my husband at work. There's something about a relationship that begins as a working relationship and then gets personal, whether that's just a friendship or romantic or whatever, that is there is such an intense amount of trust on both sides and you can go back and forth working with the person and having a personal relationship with them because you've gained the trust. I think what's harder for people is being friends with someone and then going into a working environment. I don't know, and you've done both, but I do think that starting as a working relationship and then becoming personal in some way, the level of trust there is so is just so great because you have to respect that person on a professional level and then you learn about them on a personal level and so you can volley back and forth in a way that if you start personal and then go into, you might be surprised about how someone operates at work. Oh, for sure. I pride myself on being a good partner and what that means is that I'm very consistent. I'm very, very consistent in the way I approach things and I'm very emotionally consistent. I believe that it's better to make a decision, whatever that is, right or wrong, than not make a decision. So if you, Lauren, loves red, then I love blue, who is to say I'm right and is that the most important thing? If you really care about red so much, have red. I'll take blue next time. That's kind of my attitude to all my working relationships. It's just highly pragmatic, maybe because I'm Swedish. It's kind of in me to approach life like that, but if you really care about red, I can't say red is wrong. Go for red. If I have a strong point of view, I'll put it across, but ultimately, if that's what you want, then I'll go with it. We'll see how it works out. It's not the end of the world. Do you read a lot of management books and then we'll get off the MBA track? I'm just curious. I think I used to when I was younger. Yeah, not so much anymore. You could probably write one at this point. Maybe one day. Maybe one day. I have way, way too much things I want to accomplish to stop and write a book about my philosophy. So what is your philosophy on product? Because as you know, I wrote this book with Chantal Fernandez about Victoria's Secret. It's a really interesting category. I want to get into category specifics with you. But the thing that what we sort of determined, when less bought Victoria's Secret for, I think it was a million in cash or four million in stock or something, really small amount of money in the early 80s, the category really needed to be disrupted. And he disrupted it by scaling this concept and providing cute bras and underwear for people at scale. The thing that he never really focused on though, and as you know, it's very hard to make an underwire bra in particular. It has a lot of different parts. But the quality of the product wasn't the thing or the comfort of the product or anything to do with how the product made the person, how it felt on their body. It wasn't what was driving him. It was that he would often use this rev sing quote, we sell hope not help. Like whether or not the bra actually fit the person wasn't the point. The point was that he was inspiring them to buy it. I would argue that the reason that Skims has been so successful is yes, because you have amazing marketing, because you have it looks cool. You have an amazing person sort of creating the signature idea or personality of the brand. But what it comes down to is the product wins on like even if people say they don't like certain parts of Skims, they own it because it's the best thing on the market right now. And sometimes for me, it feels like the only thing on the market. And we were asked quite a bit when we were being interviewed for the book, like what has changed about the way the consumer is right now. And we kept using this phrase, the product is the marketing. I'm curious if you believe that. And if you do, how important is the quality and the fit of the product for what you all do compared to all the other components that make it so special? Oh, I think product is number one, number two, and number three, and then comes everything. I think product is everything. I think the consumer is so much more educated today than they were in the 80s. I would also say we are comfort seekers today. I mean, try to try a pair of jeans on from, you know, 80s or 90s or, you know, try a sweatshirt on like we have, we have put comfort as number one or number two of our, let's say, decision tree, like our purchasing. So that's one. The other thing is consumers have so much more choice today. And what drives business more than any endorsement than any form of marketing is actually what consumers are telling each other. And I'm not talking about influencers that are paid or, you know, that whole network of bringing awareness. That's just another form of advertising, essentially. I'm talking about consumers one-to-one, the way that we share with our friends, the way that we share on a text group or a chat or a DM or something forward or something to try and we bring our friend and we say, look at this. So I think that we have so much information and we're so discerning with how we spend our money today that there is simply no way to build a brand without exceptional product today. It's just, I cannot see that. And when I failed, and I failed many times, it's always because the product hasn't lived up to its promise. It's always the how do you measure success? Is it sell through? Is it engagement with a product? Like, what are, obviously, you need your revenue and your EBITDA to be good, but what do you, I'm sure there's products that you all launched that aren't the best sellers in the world, but that you're really proud of. How do you kind of overall assess this stuff and say this was worth doing? It's a combination of all of the things. I mean, first of all, if dollars is the only measure of success, I would make very different decisions than I made in my career. I have never, and I've said this before, which is if money is the goal, it's actually very rarely the outcome. And so your starting point has to be you want to create something that solves the need for yourself or something you're excited about. So I think that's the starting point in everything. So that's really, I think if I wasn't proud of what we were doing, then I wouldn't feel successful, regardless of what dollars comes with it. So that's my starting point for everything I get involved with. It doesn't mean we always get it right. Sometimes we get it wrong. Sometimes we don't get there, but that's always the starting point. As a company, you have to measure success based on what is my expectations versus the result. What's my financial expectations? What's my expectations of growth? What's my expectations of the type of organization and the strength not of the individual product or collection. There'll be hits, there'll be misses. What's our consistency? What's our consistency in creating great stuff? Looking back at the launch of SKIMS in 2019, it's no surprise that those first few drops sold out, but the success was so swift. A, because you had launched several brands already prior to this. Obviously, Kim is one of the most famous people in the world. She may have been the most famous at that moment, but how did you manage that quick success? Because I can't imagine that anyone would anticipate it would scale up so quickly and so efficiently. It's not like you had to do a bunch of paid marketing to make this happen. It just happened. Yeah, I think that the success became very quickly a positive spiral. Brand can get into negative spiral, into positive spiral. According to positive spiral, I think that people liked the look. There was almost a sneaker-like urgency around the brand. It took us by total surprise. It took us years where our supply and demand was even somewhat even dematched. It took a long time. In short, no, we didn't manage it. It's incredibly hard to manage. Product takes a long time to make and ship. It took us years for that to start balancing out. You can't anticipate it. You really cannot. You have to try to do your best. I think undersupplying demand to some extent is not a bad thing, but if that gap is too large, obviously you disappoint people and you turn them off. I don't want that either. I think one of the most common misconceptions about Kim's today, we have millions of customers and we speak to millions more. We get the feedback. I didn't go to skin because I thought it was sold out. A lot of friends of mine still thinks that something they love is still sold out. It might have been an inventory now for a year or two, but just because we were so consistent, we had a stock for a long time. So I'm super grateful for that start. It was totally chaotic and it took us a moment, more than a moment, it took us a long time to balance. Each spring, 23 Pulitzer Prizes are awarded for Distinguished Journalism, Books, Drama, and Music. There was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize-winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out it was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th. Follow and listen on Apple Podcasts, the Odyssey app, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcast. I have a couple more skims questions, but I'm curious to know your thoughts. You're an investor in a luxury brand. You have worked with pretty much every luxury brand in your previous life and some in your current life. There is something going on in the luxury market right now. I keep saying a split between there are these mega luxury brands and then there are fashion brands and it's two different businesses. What do you think is happening with the customer's relationship with these big labels? It's obviously changing it as someone who's been a student of it and in that world for 15, 20 years. What do you think is happening at this point in the cycle? I think there's a few things that are converging. One, it expanded so rapidly over the last four or five years. Some pull back is to be expected. It can't simply continue. Secondly, and you've spoken about this before, they really priced themselves out. They really priced themselves out. They felt like they had infinite demand and they raised prices to a degree where it's just really hard to stomach, I think, for a lot of aspirational customers other than the super rich. Lastly, it's the industrialization of luxury. I think that plays a huge part. You asked me earlier, we were talking, I was ranting about my feelings about celebrity brands as a headline and I said integrates the defining line. What is it that we're responding to right now with the role? What are we responding with? With that new and product? What are we responding with on the cosmetic side of companies like that I'm an investor investment at Tellier, for example? Big fan. Great, great, great. Wearing it today. Great, great, great friend. She's done, she's just done the most amazing job with her company. I'm so proud of her and happy to be an extremely small part of that. But people are responding to a sense of integrity. The role has integrity. It doesn't feel mass produced. It doesn't feel like everybody has it. It doesn't feel like people say marketing and distribution plan that was executed to maximize the sales per square foot. You just don't feel it. I think that Prada and Ume also has a sense of integrity about them. Many other brands, Lueida has a sense of integrity about what he's currently doing. I think customers, at least at the top of the customer funnel is what I'm saying. I'm not saying the whole customer funnel. I think the world at a whole would still buy all these brands on mass if the price was lower. But I think the top of the customer funnel is looking for more integrity. Brands that have it seem to be having no issues. But brands that have lost it and feel industrialized and soulless seems to be losing. That's my feeling. It also feels like the internet in some ways has flattened the way consumers evaluate brands. They are evaluating skims in the same way they evaluate one of the luxury brands. The price is different, but it's that equation in their head, is it worth it? They are judging it similarly. When you look at the list of launch metrics, the top performing or list, L-Y-S-T, skims is on there with mostly luxury brands and some sports brands because it's about the brand and not the price. One question on this I have for you is, one thing that has come to the fore in recent months is this luxury brands really over stored, which was something I never thought they would do. They opened way too many stores in the hopes to rev up. The more product you ship, the more revenue you automatically do, the more stores you have, the more sales you have. That has backfired and now a lot of these retailers are closing stores. With skims, you have been very slow to open stores in my mind. How many stores you all have? Five or six at this? You just opened this big flagship in New York. If it was another person running this brand, I bet there would be 70 stores at this point. You've been very careful about the rollout. Can you talk a bit about your retail strategy and why you haven't just jumped in? I know it costs a lot of money to open a store, but you have the money. You can do it. That's not the reason. Going back to the point about luxury brands over stored, so to speak, it's what I said earlier when money is the mission. It's sometimes not the result. I think that money became the mission in fashion and at this luxury goods, they used to have other values too, that balance, longevity, brand equity, a feeling that it was hard to come by. You felt special as a customer. If there's a luxury store from brand A on every single corner in every single city, that will get lost. The money was the mission. I think it's that simple. With skims, it took a long time. Honestly, it took us so many years to just scale the demand we have online. By the time we start thinking about stores, I also think there was an expectation if we can just open a store. We're opening a store, it's going to be different. It's going to live up to customer's expectation of what a skim store is. We spend a lot of time conceptually with that. We then had a store, a secret test store in Austin for a year. We never publicized. We just wanted to learn what they wanted to buy and how they wanted to improve it and what was different from online. It's been the beauty of the whole skims project that Kim and I have been in control of our business and how we want to build it. There's always a lot of speculation, why don't we do this? When are you going to go public? We never spoken about it in public. All I've ever said is that at some point we probably will, but I've never actually spoken about it. I think with the stores, it's kind of the same thing. We did it when we focused our attention on it and we're perfectly happy with having six stores right now. We think we've landed in this great environment, in this immersive environment where people can experience the whole brand. We're still learning, but at the end of next year, there's going to be a hell of a lot more stores. We're going to open a lot of them because we think we've done it right rather than go after. Yeah, we've got to maximize the dollars. That's open stores. It's open as quickly as we can. What's our payback period? How cheap can we build them? The money wasn't the mission. The mission was to build an unbelievably exciting, beautiful store wherever we show up. I believe we've done that and I'm excited about opening stores all over the country in the coming years. The first rule of journalism is don't ask two questions in one, but I'm going to do that. I don't know if it's the first rule, but it's definitely a rule. I'm not going to ask you about the IPO. Someday, maybe I'll get the filing and dig into it. It will all be very excited for you and for us to be able to cover that. Two questions. You are around a billion dollars a year in sales from what I know, from what has been published. I don't know the exact number. I should have looked that up and sprung it on you today. What does the next, you will double in sales at some point. I feel like you don't have to do anything and that would happen. The first question is, what size of a business do you think this is? Because there are a lot of companies and obviously Victoria's Secret in a similar space to you, but also in apparel, whatever, that are six billion, seven billion, eight billion dollar businesses. A lot of people think they're too big and that they need to be smaller given the way the consumer buys things today and just the way the market works. How big do you think this business should be? What does this next phase of growth look like? You mentioned stores, but what else do you do to keep the integrity there, but continue to allow for the growth that is generally natural? Like I said, you wouldn't really have to change anything and the business would keep growing for a good amount of time because all the tools are in place, but I'm sure you will change things. Two prong question, one is how big do you think this business should be? Two, what do you do in the next year or two to manage what is inevitable growth? Here is Roussel, who is the CEO of Tory Verge, but he used to be a big fan. I used to be the chairman of LVMH fashion. He once told me, maybe 10, 12 years ago, he gave me one of the best pieces of advice when I asked him, what was the success at LVMH? He said, we transform on the way up because once we put toe, it's already too late. And at the time, that made a ton of sense to me. So I don't exactly know how we are going to transform. I hope we're in, we try to be in constant slow evolution of what we do and how we do it. I try not to think about what it can be. Kenny Rogers is not a philosopher, but a country artist. He said, I never count the money while you're sitting at the table. They repent, it's plenty enough time to count them when the dealing is done. So I don't try to figure out where we can go. I try to figure out what's more in the more immediate future. But what I would say is, I'm really trying to get it with him to define a new category of retail that sits between lounge and intimate and in the way that we need to build our wardrobes today, where that has a big, big room. And I think when you create your own category of retail, the sky is really the limit. And 15 years ago or 10 years ago, someone would have asked, how many more black leggings can do the lemon sell? I remember sitting with Remy Ruffini at the Mercer 15, maybe 12 years ago, talking about Montclair. And he told me, I wake up every morning in a cold sweat thinking, how many more black top jackets can I sell? It turned out he could sell a lot more. So I'm more focused on creating a new category in retail and see where that takes us. The brand resonates globally. We have as much traffic from outside of the United States as we have in the US. So we have a lot of opportunity in physical retail expansion, both domestically and internationally. We have category expansion opportunities. We're very early in our journey with men. So I think we have no shortage of levers to pull over the next couple of years. Right now in the more immediate future, it is expanding our stores in the US and hopefully we'll have a couple of big flagships in Europe. I can't exactly know when they're opening. It depends a bit on the planning process, but hopefully in 20 or 6, that should be the case. And we are next year starting really to build an infrastructure in Europe that can start delivering the demand we have from the region. You have so much more demand than we're fulfilling in Europe right now. And we really need to put some infrastructure on the ground. So that's kind of our focus for now. Jens, this was so fun.
