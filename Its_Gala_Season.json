Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Pucks Fashion and Beauty Memo Line Sheet. And today with me on the show is Kate Young. We're talking gala season, Taylor Swift, the state of luxury, the state of the world, and so much more. Let's get started. Hi everyone, hope you are having a great week. I'm in Los Angeles. It's very busy here, a lot going on. Just so much going on. First up is a new line sheet where I publish on Monday, I dig into the state of tomorrow, one of those groups that owns a bunch of indie brands, including Coville, Capairnay, a Coldwall, and more. I've done a little reporting on this since I got to Puck and also had reported quite a bit on tomorrow, previously at my old job. But basically it's one of these brand incubators that were really popular in the late 2010s, where a service provider would do all the back-end, do the dirty work for you, like do your sales, do your operations, do your HR. And then the idea was the designer would just be a designer. And all the manufacturing and the distribution would be handled by this larger group. And there are a bunch of these different companies, like New Guards Group was one of them, Dover Street Market, and Comde Garc√≥n, they have a sort of similar situation. And tomorrow was backed by private equity. It kind of came out of the tomorrow showroom. And their idea, they owned the majority stake in most of the businesses. But similar idea, let's grow these businesses, maybe some of them will get sold, maybe the whole thing will get sold to a larger group. Seems like now a Coldwall is going to be sold off. Probably by the time you listen to this, there may be news of who's buying it. And then some of the other brands, we'll see. There are a lot of layoffs in late October. It sounds like the way that Three Hills, which is really involved day to day in the management of the business, is positioning it is that these are redundancies. A lot of the business was set up in London, but had moved to Milan post Brexit, post COVID. All that's COVID was really tough for them. Who knows? I have an incremental update. If you all are interested in me doing a bigger thing on these incubators overall, I think let me know, send me feedback. I think they're very interesting and the overall concept makes sense. It's really hard to own your own fashion brand. The margins are terrible. If you're using shared services, then maybe it would be easier. But generally, they haven't worked super well because these businesses all have different needs, all that stuff. And I think it's just hard. I mean, it's a hard business. Why are any of us in this business? As Kate and I get into later on the show, I also checked in on Gap. There are some big changes in the way that group operates coming. And Richard Dixon, who's the group CEO, he's just making tweaks and phasing people out, bringing new people in. I think it indicates a lot about a strategy, which I would say to the powers of the B, that the thing about Richard Dixon, he just did, I think he talked at a WWD conference last week or something. And I looked and I was like, oh, maybe all this reporting I've done, some of it's going to be in here. He doesn't really say anything. He talks very big picture when he talks publicly and he never gives specifics or details. And maybe that's the fault of the journalists that are writing up these talks. But I've listened to some of them straight on. And I do think he would benefit. Depends. Like if their earnings are really great and they keep... There's nothing specific. There aren't a lot of... He doesn't call it a lot of specifics. He mentioned a collaboration with Calcaya. A lot of those collaborations were set up before he even got there. So I think the thing that I would love from him, because he does seem like he's becoming a really important leader in retail, but also in San Francisco, where the gap is based, gaping is based. I would love some... Instead of big, broad marketing speak for him to give some real talk at one of these conferences. Because I think he's capable of it. I actually think he's doing an interesting job, but it feels very superficial the way he communicates it. And that concerns me that the results are going to be superficial. So it's going to be okay for a while and then it's going to kind of go to the dumps. Hopefully that's not the case. Also, some news on the state of Fendi. I've also been getting a ton of feedback from people at LVMH regarding the exit of their long time head of HR. And I'll have more on that this week. And also, if you're in a voting guild in Hollywood, you should join us on Friday, starting at 5 p.m. for stories of the season in Hollywood. It's a big event where a bunch of different Puck talent is interviewing people from the industry. Matt Bellany runs the Hollywood section in entertainment at Puck. He's going to interview Denis Villeneuve and also Mikey Madison from my new favorite movie, Enora. And then a bunch of great people are going to be there. I am interviewing a group of costume designers, including Colleen Atwood and Jonathan Anderson, who designed both queer and challengers for Luca Guadagnino. So he's in the running for two movies this year. So it's really interesting. You have to be a Puck subscriber. Don't try to get away with that. But if you want to go to this event, I wrote about it. I think pretty much all the other talent has written about it. Email fritz at Puck.news and CC me if you want. And we can hook you up with the seat. But you should be a member of some guild and vote for things to come. That's the point of this. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this conversation with Kate. As always, she had funny and smart things to say. That's what it's like. Kate Young, welcome to Fashion People. Thanks for having me. Welcome back. How was your week? You know, not the best week I've ever had. Weird week is what we could say. Weird week. Yeah. Yeah. How about you? Yeah, it was fine. I don't really process stuff, so I'm OK. Yeah, I'm trying. I'm not watching news anymore. And I'm not talking about politics. I think that's a great way to approach life and just live as a good human being. I can't vote again for a while. I'll read the news before that. Yeah. I want to talk a bit about the state of luxury today. But I thought first we could jump into it's full-fledged gala season. And I've seen you posting a lot of your clients are, do you call them clients or do you? Yeah. Like, OK, a lot of your clients are out and about wearing different pieces. So this past weekend was one of my favorite moments, baby to baby, which I just love. Do you go? No. So I have never been invited. I am not fishing for an invite. I swear to God. But I would go if they invited me. I think it looks really fun. And I know a lot of people, like industry adjacent people are friends. I'm sure you have many friends who go. I have friends who are there. So I would totally go. It just, it probably doesn't make sense. There was a reporter from one of the papers who messaged me and said, are you going to this? And I was like, no, I'm actually, I went to see Enora and then I went to dinner at this new restaurant. Enora was so good. It was crazy. I was like, yes, this is one of the best movies I've seen in so long. It was it was so great. But no, I didn't go. And if I had been invited, I would be like, oh, I was invited. And then I would dread going and potentially. And they knew it would have the best night. True. It looks fun. It does look really fun. Did you dress anyone for Saturday for baby to baby? No. Well, why do you think baby to baby has become such? It's not just celebrities like Charlize Theron was there. Big time celebs were there. Jennifer Garner, but it's also like notable people. Obviously Kelly Sawyer, who is very fashion industry adjacent, is one of the organizers of it. But the foster husband is a major producer of movies. And they all have kids who go to school with all the celebrity kids. Like my take on it has always been that these are moms they know. Yeah. It does feel like a really, really super sized mom's night out. Yeah. Which is great. And it's so much money. It's wild. It was like $17 million or something, right? Yeah. I mean, I'm on the board of a public arts organization. So I'm constantly dealing with like, how do we raise money? How do we raise money? They raise major money. Like those women are no joke. What do you think it is about that organization other than the fact that it's like helping children? And the fact that they are very obviously well connected in Hollywood. Like what do you think has been the like convergence of all that stuff to make it become this thing that people talk about? For like a week afterwards? I mean, I think first of all, Kelly, they're all glamorous and fun and well connected. So the party's always gotten a lot of press. But then when you talk about, especially in an election year, people don't give us much money usually. But when you talk about a charity that's for babies and moms in the US, people are moved by it. Like it's very real. It's not, you know, I love the party. But save Venice is a big party in New York. And it's always like, why are we saving Venice? Why aren't we saving Americans? You know, clearly there are Americans suffering and like who need assistance. And this is a party thrown by a bunch of people who have too much or people who don't have enough. And I think everybody can relate to that. Yeah, or really feel compassion and feelings by that. And feel inspired to give maybe is the best way to do it. And they also hit up all these corporations, which is so clever. You know, there are all these corporations who sell baby products, who need a charity aspect because they're benefiting your mothers, obviously. But like that's who you give your money to. Great. Yeah, totally aligns. There is also something about that crew of women. And I don't know how close, I don't know who's close with whom, that type of thing. But there's Kelly Sawyer, there's Aaron Foster, who has this massive hit TV show, massive hit fashion line. Then there's Jamie Mizrahi, who is a big stylist and has sort of become a force in LA. But also to an extent in Paris through her work with Louis Vuitton. Then there's Sophia Rossi, who is, you know, has entrepreneurs done all this different stuff, is friends with all of them. It's a really interesting crew and extended crew that I feel like, I don't know, they do a lot. And they are, I don't know if it's soft power, but they are far more powerful than I think people have given them credit for. Maybe with the success of Aaron's show, they will all sort of come to the, if I was at the, at Sunday Styles right now, I'd be doing like a big article about that extended front group and how they've all like infiltrated different parts of culture and charitable giving and all that stuff. It feels almost like modern swans or something. I don't know. Yes. And I think it's interesting because when you look at the pictures of the party, it's really easy to be like, oh, it's just like a glamorous Instagram party and it's very clearly not. And I think Aaron Foster too, it's like, her whole shtick is kind of like, I'm like a basic bitch. Check me out. And in fact, she's not, you know, I think it's, it's great. I don't know what soft power means. What does that mean? Does that mean exactly what I said? Yeah, I think so. I mean, it's stealth power. It's basically like, let's, let's look it up and look at the Wikipedia in politics and particularly in international politics. Soft power is the ability to co-op rather than coerce. It involves shaping the preferences of others through appeal and attraction. It's non-coerce of using culture, political powers and foreign policies to enact change. So yes, like it's like, exactly what you're saying. She says, oh, I'm just a basic bitch. But the reality is she actually is far more complex and compelling, but she doesn't come out and say, you're going to do what I say because I have a lot of money and I'm powerful. You know, I can buy you. And that's interesting. And also, you know, a lot of these people don't need to work and they choose to do and do and do. Yeah. And they do interesting things. And that is always, I mean, I maybe I give people far too much credit for that, but I think it means that they have character. And so it's, it's a lot more compelling. I agree totally. So moving on to the dresses and the clothes. I'm curious, you've been dressing people for these different events. There's already been so many things in Hollywood in sort of prepping for awards season. There was the Academy Museum gala. There was LACMA. How do you feel like the, I thought the Academy Museum gala people looked really, really good. And LACMA, I was still in New York, but it looked like from the pictures, people looked very pretty. That's a little bit different because it's so much Gucci. So it's not as dynamic. But how have you felt about what people are choosing this season and what is the, what's the inventory like for you? Is there, are there a lot of options right now? And, and are they already thinning out? Are they better than usual? What's the, give me the temperature on the dress options. I mean, I thought that like LACMA with Gucci, everybody looks chic. You know, the Gucci thing, it's hard because on some level, it's a little bit boring. But then when you look at a bunch of people wearing it, you're like, they all look chic. Yeah. You know, no one looks tacky. No one looks crazy. And I thought what you said in one of your podcasts, you were at the Academy gala and you were like, people look great in person. And, and like a lot of the photographs don't speak to that. And that is like the reality of my life. I think that is the truth a lot of the time that something that looks incredible in person doesn't always photograph that well. And at big events like that, a lot of people don't get the right photograph. Like they're not, it's not Steven Miselle on the red carpet with great lighting. I wish that like the step and repeat was a walking image. I wish like there's a reason we see things on the runway because when people walk in an outfit, why street style works? When people walk in an outfit, it looks so much better than when they're standing flat in front of a wall with someone photographing them straight with straight light. It can just like flatten an image that doesn't really work. Yeah. But sorry, I'm off topic. In terms of dresses, there were a lot more dresses this year on the runway. I mean, like there were more dresses in New York, Pro-Enso did a bunch of dresses, which was super exciting for me. And like having Valentino back is exciting. We have some of them here now. They're so pretty. Like the work, the skill, seeing Alessandro have the skill of those workshops is pretty impressive. So I feel like there's a lot more to choose from. I love all the Louis Vuitton evening and it seems very custom and one off, but like it's great. Yeah. I think even like the Louis Vuitton that, God, like who wore that black? The Heim girls wore it. Yeah. It looked very chic. Divine Joy Randolph. She looked great. Yeah. It looked really good at that, at the Academy Gala. Yeah. And the row has been doing more red carpet that looks incredible. I don't know who they hired, but somebody's doing really good dresses there. So like, it's exciting because it was feeling very like, hmm, a lot of black slip dresses, a lot of naked dresses and not much else. And I feel like, although like I'm not bohemian, I'm like pretty minimal in my personal taste. I think that having the Chloe influence is like bringing back some of that romance, which is in fact like a lot of what women really like to wear and a lot of what looks good and inspires red carpet. Like not everyone looks great in a black slip dress. Yeah. I mean, you have to have a very specific body and that is magic if you have that. But dresses with some interests do a lot for a lot of different types of women. Yeah. Does that make sense? For sure. And Becky Malinsky had a newsletter this weekend about Chloe and sort of like, it just makes you feel good even if you're, and she actually did buy a piece from it. This jumpsuit that sort of looks like a dress. It's really beautiful. But the thing I think from my, because it is totally not my style, but I really like it and think it's pretty. And what I have been more drawn to since that turnover is lighter colors and color generally. So softer like blues and pinks and things that I probably would have never, I tend to wear bright pink, bright red, orange if I'm wearing a color and have been more attracted to sort of softer colors. And it just feels optimistic. And on the Alessandro beat, it really going back to this idea of things being photographed versus what they look like in person. I have a follow up question for you on that. That collection in person looked so incredible. And I was like, Oh my God, this is amazing. The shoes in particular, I was blown away by and thought, wow, these are going to sell really well. There are so many different options. They're really fun. They have, as you said, interest and most people do want some kind of flair to what they wear. And I thought the bags looked decent. Like bags, I think are very hard generally, but I thought they had some really pretty options and the clothes were beautiful. And it also for me, I understood Gucci and respected it, but I never, I always thought it was sort of like there was something missing. And I think him having the Valentino archives to have to, that was a bit of a framework that it for me added something extra. But the pictures afterwards, looking at the photos, I was like, Oh, these pictures don't look good at all because it was so dark. So the question for you is, A, when you aren't at a show, like you didn't go to Europe this season, did you? You don't go a lot, right? So I usually go, I just had to fit. I mean, you have another job. Your job is no longer. If you work at a magazine, the editorial calendar, like blocks out showtime where nothing happens, but like New York Film Festival was happening. And Scarlett had a premiere, it just like, there was no way. Didn't make sense. So when you don't get to go, when do you start judging what you see? I guess that's the first question. Like because that collection, you saw the images first, like, what did you think of the images? And did you immediately go to the showroom to look at stuff as soon as it was here? How, or in New York, how did you? Yeah, or I start calling stuff in. Like, when can I get this stuff? I want to see it because so much of it is planned so far in advance. There's even a discussion like, I really like this dress can get it. Yeah, so that I can see it. And I think I called in some of his pre-collection. And I wasn't, when I saw that, I was like, oh, it's nice to see Alessandro back. I like him, blah, blah, blah. But it looks very similar. And when we got it in, just like the level of craft is different. Yeah. You know, like the Gucci dresses were over the top and fun. And there was a lot going on. But just the level of craft, I was like, oh, and it changed the way I perceived the Valentino runway. Because I was like, I think I'm going to really like this when I see it in person. Because I think it's going to be magic. But you can't really tell on these photos. Yeah. And when you are dressing your clients, how much are you thinking about what it's because so like the divine joy, Randolph dresser is a divine. I'm terrible. Someday I'll learn how to pronounce things. Her dress in person was amazing. She looked gorgeous. The photographs, it looked washed out because it was a pale-ish pink. And it was also like sort of a warmer pink. And there was something that was lost in the flash or whatever. Those colors are so hard. Like, are you thinking about terrified of those colors? Yeah. Yeah. My like greatest Oscar fail was, God, I don't know what year it was. It was Jennifer Connolly for Beautiful Mind Oscars. She wore Nicola Guesquier, Blensy Aga. She's obviously got super pale skin. She had on a pale, pale, pale, pale pink dress with a pale green scarf. And the whole thing looked like a dish rag. In person, the colors were so magical. And like it was a real learning curve. Like, red carpet is not about subtlety. Like some of the things I like, we try on these dresses and I'm always like, that's a great dress for your best friend's wedding. You know, where you actually want to look so beautiful and celebrate something. But there are dresses, the red carpet, things need to be a little bit more archetype. You know, like the color also can, I tend to go more extreme with color because the way you perceive it is much less when especially if it's on that crazy primary red carpet, like Pantone red carpet and then LA sunshine, it makes color, it changes the way the colors photograph. Okay, I just looked this dress up and oh my God. She looks amazing because she's beautiful. But like, she really is just so gorgeous. But yeah, I'm sure in person, she looked truly incredible. And the dress, it's a beautiful dress, but the colors look like it really does look like a dish rag. A dish rag. Yeah. Oh my God. Yeah, I learned something there. That's interesting. It's also, I mean, I think about this a lot with online retailers and how they, how they photograph pieces. And I think consumers have gotten more used to it. So they can understand the nuances a bit better than maybe 10 years ago when it seemed like a lot of retailers were buying for how it would look on their websites. And I'm sure they still do that to an extent. But I think it's, people are a little more comfortable. So they, I'm so confused by, by how artsyvogue.com is and a lot of runway shows where I'm like, this isn't just for those people who are in the room. Like, yeah, there are certain runway shows where you literally can't tell is it a dress? Is it pants? Is it a cape? Like, I can't tell what's going on. It's dark. It's all piled on top of each other. And then, you know, it's hard to request clothes when you can't see them. And people should look books that are super artsy and put them on vogue.com. And it's like, I don't know what that is. Yeah. And I understand there's a difference between e-commerce and practicality, but sometimes I'm like, I think what we know is that most people who are in this business don't think about making money. It's too bad. Because then you, then you miss out on, you miss, you can't do more. The more money you make, the more you can do. That's true. Look at Jonathan Anderson. Like, he gets it. He's like, I'm going to make this stuff sell. And then I get to do all this crazy shit and have a great time. It's, it's a art. Yeah. And collect art and be a costume designer for movies. I'm, we're doing this big event in LA on Friday, where Matt, who runs the Hollywood section is going to interview Mikey Madison and Denis Villeneuve. And Peter's going to interview a bunch of actors. Oh, your friend, Jeremy Strong. I don't know if you're dressing him for it. I'm not. He dresses himself most of the time. I did the met cause he was in a play. Oh yeah. I saw him at the San Vicente bungalows a few weeks ago and he was wearing like a very narrow look that potentially brown. It was definitely brown and a very small bucket hat, like very small though. He loves clothes. I love it. It's so fun. I mean, especially in LA where every guy is just wearing like two tight khakis and those, what Brent, what sneakers are they all into now? They've moved on from the Laura Piana, Lisa. It might, they, I'm sure there's a lot of that, but they all wear, I forget what it is. It's some just like very expensive white sneaker. Who knows? But anyway, he's an inspiration to us all. But anyway, I'm doing a costume designer panel and Jonathan's going to be on it. So it's like him and Colleen Atwood. Yeah, it's amazing. I mean, what a life, but there are so few of them that sort of understand and few people in the fashion business. Like you look at the margins on these businesses and you just think, why would anyone, you know, why would anyone go into this willingly? That's true. That's true with restaurants. It's true with carouselons. There are a lot of businesses that have a cap, right? Like you can only, I always think about those businesses where there are chairs, you know, like there's a limit on what you can make because you have to empty the chair in order to turn it over. But like you go into it not because none of us, we'd all go be bankers or something or consultants or whatever rich people do. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes I'm like, maybe I should have been a banker. I didn't know that what that was when I was 21 years old. So you're right. And then there's this other part of the industry, though, that there are, you know, like 60% margins and they're making tens of billions of dollars a year on one product, 100%. I was talking to someone last week about the Mu Mu hype and how everybody needs to chill out because at some point they're not going to have 100% year over year growth. And it's going to be fine. They're still going to sell a lot of stuff, but the world just like hypes the stuff up. And it's just, I want everyone in the media and everyone in surrounding the media who reads the media to understand that this is not forever. So that when it slows down, people don't have a connection. It doesn't mean that the business is going to share. Right. Right. Right. What do you think about the last time we checked in about the state of luxury or whatever, we discussed like what's available, what's not, what's missing for the consumer. But since then there's been all these earnings reports and, you know, everybody has essentially missed analysts expectations other than Hermes. Hermes is a very unique business. Prada is still doing really well. Prada sales wise is being sort of uplifted by Mu Mu. But I would say if you look at the underlying Prada business, it's still pretty good also. What do you think's happening in culture that is creating this sort of quote unquote crisis, whether it's a crisis or not is debatable. But I mean, I think a few things, I think exhaustion, you know, that designer bags are starting to feel like boring. Everybody has one. You know, when you, when you go out on a Saturday night, it's just like Celine Bottega, YSL, Celine Bottega, YSL, Chanel. And it doesn't feel so unique or cool or statusy. I think like there's an exhaustion with it. And you texted me before and said luxury crisis. And I was thinking about it, trying to think of something clever. And I was wondering if could the luxury houses actually be producing every time someone spends too much money? They say, I'll have it forever, which is a fallacy. The pant shape changes. The shape of bag we like changes. It's called fashion for a reason. You won't have it forever. It won't be cool in five years. But maybe are these things lasting longer? Maybe is someone buying a Chanel bag and not buying another bag for two years? You know, because they're more expensive and they're more timeless, say, than like the latest Louis Vuitton style that comes out every six months. Yeah. I think that's possible. I definitely, when I spend more, I buy less, not only because I don't want to be in debt, but also because if you're going to spend so much money on something, it feels like you should get your, your money's worth on it. I bought a Chanel flat bag. I think it was 14 years ago now. And I've never bought another one, but I still use that. It's not like my regular everyday bag, but it, I've gone through phases of it and it still feels like really special. And at the time, I think I paid $2,500 for it. That was a huge amount of money for me. I mean, it still is. But then it was like really crazy. I was making like $65,000. So I was, I was thinking about that. Maybe, you know, the number of people who actually can afford to buy a luxury bag, if they're at an uncomfortably high price point, maybe they all bought them. And they're good for a couple of years. You know, and maybe it's also feeling like, I'd rather get some bag. Like I bought a bag this summer. You know, James Scully opened a shop in Hudson. Yeah, I heard that. It's so good. And I went to visit him and have lunch. And he has these handmade bags that are like vegetable dyed leather made by some interior designer from Antwerp. And I bought that because I was like, I like this. It feels luxurious. It feels handmade. It feels luxury on a scale of a fancy bag. And everybody doesn't have it. Yeah. So like maybe my buying pattern is representative of the way people, you know, I think people really like those stores that feel special. Yeah. What's James Store called? Oh, it's called Jamestown. Jamestown. Oh, great. Yeah, I love that. I love plain goods, which is in where Washington, Connecticut are around there. It's true. I agree. I had a long time. We've never met, but sort of like acquaintance who has been covering fashion. She really focuses on American made stuff, messaged me yesterday on Instagram and say, what do you think about? She might buy the Alaya Tecl. And which one's that? The tube? Yes. Yeah. And I said to her, she was like, do you think because it has the foil? Because you know, my I'm very anti the gold foil embossing on bags. I just think like it's over and they need to stop all of them. Like it is really upsetting to me. It feels like something Phoebe Philo did. And then everybody copied. And on her bags, it's just like embossed no foil and I that's fine. But my personal preference is no, I have a bag from the row that just has the little circle, I guess it's an R or something embossed with no, and it doesn't say the row. I mean, it's almost 10 years old now. I mean, somebody needs to be the new man, Sir Gabrielle. Yeah. Right. Like, I do think that bag was a palette cleanser at a time when people are a little exhausted with luxury that yes. Yeah. And it felt like, oh, I have good style. I'm not trying to prove I'm rich. This feels chic and good looking and well made. Yeah. You know, there was something to that trend. Yes. Yes. Claire V to that same kind of thing. Yes, I agree. I think interestingly, APC is doing really good bags right now. They have the gold foil. I would recommend they stop because I would have bought one. Like the bag shapes are really good. You know, you can get the gold foil off. I know. But like, would I need to take it to the leather guy? No, you just you put alcohol on it and scratch it with a toothpick. Maybe I'll do that. I do like them. I don't know why I know. Oh, I do know why I know that my son wanted a wallet I had that I got as a Christmas gift with my initials on it. Really big. So I went on YouTube to see how I could get it off. Amazing. And I did. It works. That's very funny. Yeah, I like those bags and I need something. I have a lot of New York that like I have bags that fit my laptop and that are large for New York City. And then I have clutches, but I have no bag to take to lunch here. This is a really big issue. But it's true. Like, I just don't have like I need like a picotine size bag, that type of thing. I tend not to carry bags. I put my wallet in my pocket and a lip balm and go. Yeah, that's what I've been doing this year, because instead of buying a bag, I bought a leather jacket. And so I am just using the leather jacket. But that's usually only works for nighttime in LA. You know, I do have one like status bag that I'm sort of coveting right now. And I was at a party and this older woman said, oh, let me give you my business card. And she pulled around a little leopard Fendi baguette and opened it. And there was like a pack of smokes in there and a lip liner and like a stack of business cards. And I was like, you just showed me the bag from my twenties. Yeah, like this bag looks like fun to me. And it made me really think like a beaded Fendi baguette. I think I have one in my storage. You probably do it or you can find one on the real real. It does feel like it's Fendi's moment, 100th anniversary next year. It's time for that to really and also they're pretty roomy, right? There's a decent amount of room in there. You can just pack a smoke and your wallet in there. And like your Nokia. What else do you need? So one thing that has been sort of following me chasing me around the internet is our friend Taylor Swift's look this weekend. Speaking of it bag, speaking of making fashion choices, feels like Taylor has really gotten into fashion as of late. She was wearing this mixed print Vivian Westwood dress, a pair of velvet. I don't know if they would be called mules. They had two straps on the front. I personally didn't mind them, but I got several responses to me posting this outfit on Instagram where the people were like the shoes, but the shoes, but I thought the shoes were fine. I would wear those shoes with a pair of jeans or something. I think I said, oh my God, the shoes. It's possible. You, Alison Roman, comment, if we want to talk about boldface names commenting on the shoes, Alison Roman also commented on the shoes and there was another person. It was, it was definitely shoe driven. My personal take on this look in particular was the hair, which is like prom tendril thing happening. Look, I am very pro Taylor Swift. I am pro her. Well, I don't know if I want to go as far as to say I don't endorse anyone. This is a swiftie disclaimer. Yeah, I don't endorse anyone. I know like but I'm pro her being into fashion and not wearing stuff that everybody will like or think is cool. My question for you as a professional, if you were working with her, like, how would you guide her because she clearly has her own ideas and has her own way of doing things and she vibes with her stylist who she's worked for with forever, who seems awesome and they have a great time together. And I think on the red carpet, generally, many times she looks, she does like a stupid thing that doesn't look right. But generally, like, I think she looks always looks fun and whatever. It's, it's at least we're talking about it. It brings interest. But like, if you were working with her, what would you, how would, how would you advise her to, because she's not going to look like Zoe Kravitz who's wearing this like a beautiful, speaking of slip dresses, slip dress with sheer tights and black tights and like looks all elegant and shit. Like that's not going to be what she is. Honestly, when I look at the outfits a lot of the time, I would tell her to stop watching Sex in the City. I think Sex in the City, watching Sex in the City leads people to make some of the most bizarre and unfortunate fashion choices because it worked on that show. But people watch that show and they start buying kooky shoes on the real, real and prom dresses and doing their hair crazy, putting clips in their hair. Sex in the City leads to the worst personal style known to humankind. And I love that outfit. And I'm like, she was drinking wine with some friends and she wore that dress over to watch Sex in the City, which would have looked really cute with sneakers or some brogues. And she was like, Oh no girl, I need to borrow your heels. And I need a necklace and a tiny little lady bag. Let's go out to dinner. And it looks crazy. It's so crazy. It looks like mommy drinks. No. And I'm here for it in the way that it's entertaining. And on some media level, it's genius. Just keep us all talking. But it does look to me like Pat Fields is casting a spell on people. I hope someone listening to this who gets to profile Taylor Swift, I guess she never does interviews, but she did do one last year. Maybe she'll do another one asks her if she watches Sex in the City. I think you're right. It is very true. It's kind of like Leandra Medine's similar situation. She has amazing style. I get tons of inspiration from her and ideas, but no one else can dress like her. No one else can wear. No, it's a straight line. So she avoids ever looking like she can go naked and it doesn't look vulgar. And she can wear crazy prints and weird shaped pieces and they work because there's no bumps anywhere. But it's highly impractical for most women with a body. And I think also her attitude, which you could see in the photos is an attitude of like utter confidence in whatever she wears. She's not trying to project anything. She's projecting who she is. And that kind of like pure, clear confidence is very rare too in any human being. It's like very much about her personality, but that it's a similar thing of, as Sex in the City, I don't know if there was like a lot of inspiration to be taken, honestly. But like with Leandra, if you pull one thing, I often watch the colors she's wearing and we'll be like, oh, that color, that's interesting. I'm going to try to incorporate that more. Oh, she's a great fashion editor. She also has an incredible eye for trends, definitely for runway trends, but she'll be like, I am seeing this and here's how I'm going to interpret it. And it's just something in the ether and she's so good at finding it and articulating it verbally and then physically on herself. But I think like, you know, there's like a pinterest problem, which is people often share these pinterest boards with me, clients saying, oh, I want to look like this. And I'm like, you've pinned a body here. Yeah. Like you like a five foot 10 body with legs that are, you know, roughly five foot of that body. You don't have that body. I can pull that dress when you try it on. You won't like it. Yeah. And like we can never, like so much of my job is fashion being practical. I know like my clients are more beautiful and perfect than the average American because that's their job, but they're still real. Yeah. Model's bodies, they look that way because clothes look good on them. Yeah. So like I, clothing has a function on bodies for me to use it. And like Leandra has a body like a model. So everything functions. That's like, it's not part of the equation. Yeah. It's interesting. She's not hiding anything or masking anything. Yeah. I sent her this dress, this reformation dress, which was like a red turtleneck knit dress with a bubble hem and a very like thick, almost like a tire thickness bubble hem. And on reformation site, they had like a normal commercial model wearing it and honestly didn't look great. Then she had, then they had Dree Hemingway wearing it in like advertising and she looked amazing. And I sent it to Leandra and I said, you would look great in this dress. Like I want someone to have this dress. It's just, it's for someone with really long legs. And she said, I'm really into tights right now. Cause that's who she is. Like she's, yeah, she could do it, but she's not, she's dressing for herself and no one else, which is so interesting because if it were me, I'd be like, oh yeah, I'm going to like put a lot of moisturizer on my legs and wear these high heels and wear this fun dress out. But for her, she was like, I'm into tights right now. So she's, it's, it's so interesting. She's, she's definitely someone who I think 15 years from now or 20 years or 30 years will be on people's speaking of Pinterest boards, but like mood boards of collections and things, her influence on fashion, I think is, is far greater than she's been giving credit for so far because we live so much in the moment right now, but looking back, it's going to be interesting when there are like books about Leanne.

You have brought two sub stacks up in this short conversation. And I have sub stacked the T right now. Yeah. I reached a point where I was like, I'm tired of all these people selling me stuff. Yes. Yeah. And have you experienced that? Or are you still really into it? Are you able to like... This is a great point. I have experienced it and have unsubscribed from quite a few. I would say someone who's very smart said to me recently, sub stack, people are thinking of sub stack is like the new journalism or whatever. It's not, it's the new Twitter. And so it's an extra long Twitter and it's a place. And there was a really interesting conversation with that writer, Kyle Chaka on his, I think his personal sub stack and a bunch of other writers. And one of the writers said, I subscribe to sub stack to keep up with my friends. It's not about, like, yes, there's like KC Newton tech reporter who breaks a lot of news on his sub stack, but like, that's not going to exist. Those kinds of people are going to have roll ups and they're going to be companies like Puck or whatever where those kinds of writers, like I could have done a sub stack and I had no interest in that because I wanted to have an editor and health insurance and all that stuff and not run my own business. The sort of more traditional journalists will sort of form. And there may be some outliers, but mostly that's going to be a place to like release thoughts. And what I would say is Becky and Leander are two of my closest friends. So would I subscribe to their newsletters if I didn't know them that well? Sure. I subscribed to Laura Riley's newsletter and we're just acquaintances. I think she does a good job at like organizing. She's very front of book. So it's like fashion news, Amelia Petrarcha, same thing. Like, I obviously know Amelia. I really like her. Is that shop rat? Yeah. And I think like it's interesting. It's not, I don't subscribe to any of the ones that are just like other than Laura, shop, shop, shop, shop, shop, shop, shop, shop, shop, shop, because I don't care. And I also, I do that every day and in my own head. So, but I think, yeah, I think that like, it'll evolve of what it actually is. Like if you look at someone like Emily Sumberg, who I'm having on on Friday, we're supposed to record tomorrow. So we'll see. She does, it's like business news. It's a lot of aggregation. She definitely gets a little, some scoops and things, but really, if she had started 10 years ago, she'd just be like a really famous on Twitter. Like she has that kind of quick, it's those quick insights. So I think like, yes, there's too much of that stuff, but also it's just evolving into something else. So the question is, like, is there a business around Substack that for people who aren't, Becky and Leandra make their own money, they could have their own website and they wouldn't need, I mean, Leandra has done that. Like they don't need Substack to make money. They have, Becky has a whole personal styling business. She, they work with brands all the time. So do they need Substack? Whereas a lot of these people, they don't have that sort of robot. Like how are they going to make money and how is Substack as a larger entity going to make money? Like they're very good at getting people, subscribers, but are those subscribers of high quality? What is the sort of business model around something like that? Twitter never really figured it out. So, so yeah, so But Substack, you're paying at least Twitter was free always, right? Now you pay for the check or something. Yeah. I mean, I haven't looked into Substack's financials deeply. Maybe I should for a future column, but I don't know like, they're, I'm sure they're not profitable, but if there is like a path to sustainable profit, maybe they are. I mean, they may have lower overhead than I imagine, but I think right now what their, their strategy has been is to invest as much as they can in different writers in the hopes that like it would become an ecosystem that was, that they could like make money when they're sleeping or whatever. The other thing is you can't do a lot of advertising on there. You can't put a lot of types of ads. They don't encourage it, really. They want it to be subscription first and that's okay. But it makes it, it's just a, it's a tricky balance. Like most of these writers really need the need Substack to grow their audience, but then once you get really big, what's the benefit of staying on there? And that's something I think they have. That's what I noticed Yolanda Edwards went off. Yeah. Oh yeah, she did. That's very true. Yeah. And yeah, it's, it's interesting. My husband is thinking about, he's had a newsletter since a paid newsletter since 2019 or so. And he's thinking of publishing on Substack and on his own URL, just to get his unpaid subscriber base higher, because you can pick people up so quickly that's just, there's so much like cross promotion that happens. Yes. He hasn't done that yet. That's breaking news for, for all the people who read the new consumer. But it's a fascinating thing. But are there any that you still read that you really like or any that have nothing to do with fashion? Oh, I, you know, I like some cooking Substacks. Yeah. Like I do really like to cook. And if I have a weekend off, I like to have people over and cook a lunch or cook a big dinner. And there are tons of people who used to work at magazines or people who have one cookbook, but who I like their Substack because they travel and post pictures and are inspiring. Yeah. And then the rest is fashion. Yeah. I like Claire DeBoer's Substack. I, I love Allison Roman's Substack. Colu Cook's, you know that Colu? Oh yeah. Colu Henry. She's great. Yeah. She posts amazing recipes. We also do Molly Boz. I like her stuff. Oh, we have that cookbook. Yeah. It's all such like teens food. It's hilarious. It's a hit with my children. The language takes some meat and put cheese on it and get it hot and melty. And also you can't use the full word. It has to all be abbreviations. Like instead of Caesar salad, it's like sea salad. My husband just interviewed her. He's going to have her cause she's launching Mayo, but it's called like yeah, or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Or just like some insane thing, but it's really good. We have it. It's delicious. So we've been trying it, but yeah. So on the fashion editor beat, and then we should wrap up because I have another meeting. Oh, wow. I mean, the one thing we didn't say, I think about luxury, that luxury is that I guess the economy is going to be great. Right? I mean, I mean, none of us want to say this. The Bitcoin is like $85,000 right now. It's just like everything's going up, up, up, up, up, but then I don't know tariffs. This is not my expertise. Yeah. Look, it's I'm going to be on the powers that be on Wednesday discussing this specifically anyone who wants to listen. I would say that first of all, the economy is in pretty good shape right now. And we just got out of a bad like the interest rates are falling. Like we just got out of the toughest part and it was way, way better than anyone thought. So like, yes, it's going to be basically four years of fixing all the mistakes happened. And now the mistakes have been fixed. And now we will have a decent economy for time. The question is like this tariff stuff and is this going to make things way more expensive, slow down the economy, things are already too expensive. The thing that is frustrating is this idea of like bringing manufacturing back to the US because it's just not going to happen. Like if it happens, it's going to be automated manufacturing. And I'm a huge proponent of localized manufacturing because of speed to market. And if you want to actually reduce like environmental stress and all that stuff, like localized manufacturing makes sense, but a lot of that's going to be automated. And the other thing is it's not easy to find people who want to do these jobs. They say they want jobs, but like when it comes down to it, that's not how our society is built anymore. We're a society of consumption, not a production. So I think for the next couple of years, someone really smart who worked at one of the big luxury groups for a long time, I saw last week said to me, this is a very much on the same lines of like 2012, 2013, which didn't feel that bad then. But we were also in like, there wasn't as much media and it wasn't minute by minute. And also there was an uplift from, there was such a terrible crash. We haven't had that. But this person was like, 26, 27, 28 is going to be awesome. The next couple of years for luxury itself are going to be challenging because what you're saying, like even if people have money, they're probably going to spend it on other stuff because they're just kind of sick of it. But this person predicted that it'll be like 26, 27, 28 will be like 2015, 2016, 2017 when like Alessandro and Demna and all those people sort of came to the top. So yeah, I think you're right. And also we just don't know, we don't know if Trump's just going to threaten all these tariffs to get these people to do things he wants them to do. It may actually happen. It may not. He's going to do what he wants to do. And there are going to be no other outside factors he will make his decisions. So I think that you're right. I do have to run because I'm going to be late to this meeting, but one final question. Mark Jacobs editing, December issue of Vogue, speaking of fashion editors, I haven't gotten to see it in person yet. I love the cover obviously. You can. I tried to buy it this morning. It's not on newsstands yet. Oh, okay. It's just on the internet. So I'm going to have to go to Larchmont. The remaining newsstand on the east side of Los Angeles to buy it at some point. But what do you think? My first take is so gorgeous, so fun. It's gorgeous and fun and exciting to see Vogue do stuff that's so impractical. I mean, those insane shoes and clothes that don't really work. It's fun. Like it made me feel like old magazine times. Yes, me too. And it felt like, oh, this is what a magazine should be. It felt really exciting. Yeah, artsy pictures that make you want to dream. And I was more scandalized. Mark reposted that video of the vlogger talking about it and he like trashed Vogue in the middle of it and trashed Anna. Amazing. He was like, they never put anything this good. Was it I deserve couture? I don't know who it was. I thought on Mark's Instagram. So funny. It was just like a repost. And I was like, ooh, you're just counting on no one at Vogue watching the full video. So funny. I love how open Mark is to different projects and different types of media outlets. He contributed a gift to the Puck gift guide, which is very exciting. Amazing. Yeah, it was very fun and sweet of him. It was really, I was like, just make it funny. And they made it funny. But I love him. Final question. Do you think this is an endorsement for the Chanel job? Oh, no. No, I don't think that's going to happen. Do you? No. Maybe I'm crazy. No, I mean, I think it would be really fun. But I don't know what, I honestly have no idea what's going to happen. All I know is how much they're paying people. And you can read if you want the number, subscribe to Line Sheet. And it's not that much. I read. Yeah, it's not that much. It's not that much. And which, so it makes... That wouldn't pay for his nails, man. That's true. And the thing is, it is this thing of like, if they want to set it up like Hermes, then that makes a lot of sense. We'll see. I think whoever ends up getting it, I think the world is going to be excited about it. But it would be fun. You know, we can dream. The whole thing that Mark wants everyone to do is dream. Yeah. That's the thing of fashion. Kate, it was so nice to see you. Thanks for being here. You too. Thanks for having me.
