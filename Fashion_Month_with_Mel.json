Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of pucks, fashion and beauty memo line sheet. And today with me on the show we have interview editor in chief Mel Ottenberg to talk fashion month's greatest hits on and off the runway. Let's get started. Happy Friday everyone. Hope you had a great week and a great fashion month. I am back in LA for a quick stint and then Monday morning I'm off to New York for the launch of my book, Selling Sexy, Victoria's Secret and the Unraveling of an American Icon. I wrote it with my former colleague Chantal Fernandez. I'm going to be promoting it all week next week. I'm going to be super annoying. Feel free to mute me during this period or at least buy the book. I'd really appreciate it. Buy it from wherever. Doesn't matter. I don't care if you buy it from Amazon. Care if you buy it from bookshop.org. As long as you buy it, I'm happy. This week in line sheet, there is a lot. The main thing on Thursday was that I had a bunch of details and analysis on Elviam H's off-white offloading. They sold off-white to Blue Star Alliance, which is one of these licensing firms. To be honest, look, does Elviam H own off-white at this point? Probably not. One thing I do believe is that Virgil Abloh's legacy needs to be preserved. I think putting this in a licensing firm isn't a great idea simply because they're not going to manage the brand properly. I almost think, look, it still makes a good amount of money, I'm told, but it could always just close it for a while. I don't know. I don't think that it's worth it to do it this way. I'm sure 25% of the story that I know, there's 75% that I don't. Maybe someday I will. If I find out, I'll let you know. It's a complicated situation and just a bummer. There's also just lots of news and scoops. Elviam H is just making all these moves. They are selling stuff. They are potentially buying stuff. There is obviously all the executive changes and lots going on over in Paris. Obviously, the Eddie, Celine, departure, Michael Ryder coming in. We're all very excited, but what's Eddie up to? Today, it was all about he bought a place in Milan and he's going to go work at a big house there. I'm not even going to say it because you know what, this is too out of control. Let me do a little reporting and I'll let you know hopefully on Monday what I hear. I'm really excited to have Milan to talk about all the crazy fashion week stories and not so crazy fashion shows. I think this was a pretty tame week, nothing revolutionary I can think of, but some fun stuff. Mel's fun. I like chatting with them when we're sitting in the seats. I like chatting with them other times too. We'll have a good time. Also, he made these jeans for Redone. They're just really good. I just ordered a pair actually in two sizes to see which ones fit, but they're like the exact jean that I want right now. Medium wash. I think there's a lighter wash too, but I got the medium wash. Mid-rise based on an 80s, 505. They're really good. He wears the best jeans, so I'm excited to try them. We're going to talk about how you make jeans and what he thinks about American style. I hope you enjoy it. Hit me up if you have any tips or comments or concerns or you want to harass me. I'm happy to receive it. We'll talk soon. Let's get going with that. Mel Ottenberg, welcome to Fashion People. Thanks, Laurie Sherman. How you doing? I'm good. How is Paris? Post-Fashion Week. I did a two-day outdoor night shoot in the two nights after Paris Fashion Week, so I'm a little destroyed right now, but I'm happy. How late is a night shoot? Is that like you start at 11? I worked from like 8.30 a.m. to 1.00 a.m. one day, and then I worked from 2.00 p.m. to 2.30 a.m. the second day outside. It was actually really fun, so it's all good. I'm definitely a little destroyed from a big month of no days off plans, shows, blah, blah, deadlines, closed an issue of interview, launched a jeans collab. There's just a lot of stuff, but that's the name of the game. That's we're going to talk about all of it. Before we get started, we usually ask on the Friday show what you had for breakfast. What did you have for breakfast today and also do you eat breakfast during Fashion Month? I absolutely eat breakfast during Fashion Month. Breakfast is an essential meal. I never skipped breakfast, and I definitely never skipped breakfast during this whole thing. What I usually do is I wake up and I order an American coffee, hard boiled eggs, some berries, and maybe some bacon. That's it. Sometimes I go jogging, and sometimes I don't. It sounds perfect. This time it's been pretty good. I got to say. That's the exact right food as well, because the new thing, other than protein, is fiber. And berries have a lot of fiber. Okay, that's great to know. Oh, by the way, I was eating, sometimes I was eating some bread with butter. I am on a serious no sugar thing. I think I have 65 days off of sugar right now, but sometimes we need carbs during Fashion Month. It's like, you can't eat. You do. It's going. You really do. I mean, I tend to not do any running because I'm walking everywhere. The crazy thing is, have you ever trained for a race during Fashion Month? I have not. I have, and you end up doing like 35,000 steps. Right. Like half marathon, marathons, and it gets a little bit crazy, because I'm walking so much. But it is amazing to me how I never, I'm never like full. I'm always hungry all Fashion Month, because you're just going constantly. I have a really good thing going with my driver, Arash. He is my rock and he feeds me nuts and figs sometimes in between. And he really helps me find like good restaurants that I can eat at and piece by myself that are real local restaurants. And that is just, oh my God, Arash is the best. And that really helps me stay saying, eat a. It's important. These are important details, Mel. So let's start from the beginning. Let's start in New York and maybe go through and talk about our favorite shows and your favorite moments and maybe some of the other stories that were brewing during this time that had nothing to do with the runway or maybe something to do with the runway. But what in New York, what did you start with? Did you start with Alaya and go on or Proenza? I was at Alaya and I, oh my God, New York seems like such a blur because we were closing. We're always closing our fall interview. I'm a veteran chief of interview and we're always closing our fall issue during New York Fashion Week. So I'm always really trying to do as much work in the office with my team as humanly possible because I'm going to be leaving. This time it's our 55th anniversary issue that we were closing and it's a huge issue. So it's more insanity than usual. We had some big shoots during New York Fashion Week. I kind of always do. So it's like all that. And it's so hot, which I really, I don't love, but it's always hot. The weather is always a big problem pretty during New York Fashion Week. It's always brutalizing me in a way that is fundamentally depressing, I think. It was so much better this time and I think that's why it was better, why people left happier. And I had basically packed. The weird thing coming from LA now is that I have to pack for that time period in New York and it's not a great time to be in New York. You want to be in New York a month later. But I packed like summer clothes and I ended up, I had to buy a jacket. Had to buy a jacket. I was happy that the weather was better. But anyway, I was barely able to go to shows, but I went to some, I went to Alaya. I went to the Alaya dinner that was great. It was like a really heavy duty dinner at the Brand Foundation. And I won't even remember what else I did during New York Fashion Week, except for work. I was also working on all of my stuff for my Redone launch. I did a collab with Redone, Mel by Redone. I was working on all of that there. So all I remember doing is working. What other shows did you go to? What did I go to? I went to everything and don't remember any of it. I think my last show was Michael Kors, which I love him and think, I can't wait for this merger to happen so that these companies can move on. He had Giant, I think you were, did you go to that? No, I was working at that. He had like Giant Bulldozer Rocks as like, they must have been sculptures or something. But the message I felt like was like, these companies, he can't do anything because these companies are stuck in stasis. And so it was just funny that it was these big, big rocks. I don't know if that was a subliminal message or not. I didn't ask him. But it looked lovely. I just was like, damn, it really sucks. You need to get your... Because I think that the trial to fight the FTC wants to block this merger with Capri and Tapestry. And Capri owns Michael Kors. And it started, I think, the first day of New York Fashion Week. And Michael had to testify and talk about how much his brand needs to be changed. It was very stressful. And so I thought he had a good... He did his best given the crazy circumstances. But it was one of the only examples of the real world sort of seeping into the runway. But I loved Eli. I thought it was great. And it gave that week such an amazing energy. And I was so happy that I was there. I loved Tory Burch, which was... They did this basically tiled space that looked like a pool. Like an indoor swimming pool. Really beautiful, tiled pool. And the clothes were fun too. But I swear to God, it's about like chlorine. It was very fun. Tory and Michael, you know I love you both. And I'll be at your show next season. This season, Lio was one of the only shows I was able to go to because of my schedule. But I mean, I love Michael Corris and I want whatever happens to be in his favor. It's gonna be... I think so, yeah. I think the world is moving in the right direction for fashion. Good things are happening. So did you go to Burberry? I did not. So you started in Milan? I started in Milan. Wait, let me put up my calendar one second. I also didn't go to Burberry and then I'm gonna try to go next year. Well, I like going to Burberry because I like... It's a nice... I didn't go to Burberry. What I ended up doing was I flew to Barcelona and I shot the Jackmust campaign, which came out literally 10 days later. Fun. Yeah. And so that was so fun. How long have you been working with them? You know, I have known Simón since he was working at Dauvers, at Comte Gresson. And I was like, oh my god, that guy's such a star, clearly. So I guess I met him 10 years ago. But this is the first time I worked with him and I styled this campaign. I styled this football superstar, Jules Condé. It was so great. And so anyway, I was in Barcelona, did that. How do we get in Barcelona? Was closing interview and then flew to Milan. So my first show, I'm going to tell you right now, right about now. Wait, what day was that? Was it like the 14th? No, the first show was Fendi on the 17th. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fendi, Marni, Boss, Prada, Moschino, Emporio, Todd's, Valentino, Gucci, Versace. So where, what did you love in Milan? Well, my favorite thing of the whole season was a look at the end of the Botego show that was like, it was a long sleeve black top and a black skirt. If it was like below, it was a below the knee black skirt with matching long sleeve black top and that had these matchsticks embroidered matchsticks that were flying off it. And I thought that is cool. That is luxury. That is new. That's taking the 80s vibe that we're all feeling and doing something really cool with it. I was so impressed. Nothing surpassed that excitement for me. I liked a lot of things this season, but that was my favorite, favorite, favorite. I love that also. And I went backstage. It's almost like, you know, all those little, that like mouth motif that a lot of designers used over the years. I don't know if it started with Scaparelli or not, but just like lips, red lips, like a tiny little, you mean, didn't jewel red lips? Yes. Like it reminded me of that, but new. Like at first I was like, is that what that is? And backstage, he was talking about a lot. Matu was talking a lot about childhood and it was supposed to sort of be like kids dressing up like grown ups, first day of school vibes, first day of works vibes. He talked about the first interview dress, but he said about that dress in particular, it's a dangerous game. And A, he's so good at those scrums backstage. It was so calm and he's so clear and he communicates so well, but it was, I thought it was fabulous also during that week, you and I chatted because there was the whole like Olivia Nuzzy Ryan, Lisa or Ryan, Lizza, Olivia Nuzzy, Ryan, Lizza, gate that happened in RFK. How's he gay? Yes. So what would you do if you're the editor of interview? I feel like someday you would you like have her interview someone? Like how would you use this cultural moment? I can't tell you, but I have something I've already made my decision about how to use the cultural moment. I mean, I'll tell you, I'll tell you, I'll tell you off the record afterwards, but I don't reveal your trade secrets. Yeah, but I made a decision the day after that about how, what that inspired in me. I'll tell you afterwards, but I, I'll tell you right now, but I'll talk soon. I love it. I'm glad that I understand your work to know that this would be something you would be interested in. Okay, so that's what I'm doing. And then I was like, oh, duh, like that's, that's what I want to do. Yeah. Moving on. I love, I mean, I was really enraptured by that. You know, when the post, I do not agree with the New York Post and all their political stuff and the thought bullshit, but, but when they really grabbed me, they grabbed me, and that's where he grabbed me. We also, I also didn't see, I didn't see Cheryl Hines at Valley of a Wow. She was there and also looked great. Larry's wife. I spoke to her. I saw, I read that. I felt compelled. I felt compelled as, as the puck reporter in, since we were leading on this story to speak to her. She was very nice and also amazing. Well, I also, it's interesting because, you know, listen, RFK Jr. is hot and Olivia Nuzzy is hot and really smart. And, and I really like her writing and also she's a bae. So yeah, and also while I am not into RFK Jr. in any way she performed besides what he looks like, I think he's hot. So, you know, I'm, I'm clicking the link in bio. And look, she, I mean, she also has a very particular style, which I feel like is interesting to hook into. Like you, you're doing an interview and you're wearing your sweater off the shoulder. You're 31 years old and you are that like made up and put together. I think it's, you know, it's very interesting for all our listeners who don't know what we're talking about, Google NUZZI, LIZZI RFK, and you'll get all the news. The thing that I found interesting, LIZZI, LIZZI, yeah, sorry. The thing that I found interesting about it was just zooming out and looking at page six and how they cover things. They really do, do an incredible job at sending these breaking emails about very minor things. But for some reason, do you get their emails? I don't get their emails, but I definitely feel like they, Instagram knows that I want all of the New York Post and page six Instagram posts when I, as the media is possible, because whether or not I agree with them, which again, I don't. And a lot of their stuff is like, let's throw this out there to ignore this crazy Trump stuff for advanced stuff for anti-abortion stuff or whatever or anti-Protroy stuff. You know what I mean? They'll like throw this stuff up very effectively, right? Yes, for sure. And it's with the emails, it's like yesterday they sent one. Let me just look it up. And I was just like, you know what? Yes, I really did need to know this. And it was something about Dave Grohl, something about Dave Grohl not wearing his wedding ring, exclusive. If I could handle one more email, I would sign up for page six emails. You really should. And the thing is they are so, they don't stress me out because it's always something really minor. It's never, I mean, if someone dies, if a celebrity dies, that gets one too, but it's always like these very small incremental updates and they believe it's worthy of an email. So what you're saying is it's giving you the small incremental update and all the information right there in your email. Yes. And I don't even need to open it. Okay. So I do need that. It's very calming. Okay. Message definitely received because I also like that I can open an email. I can open an email from you Lauren Sherman and read the line sheet without clicking the link. You know, the link clicking is, you know, I already have to do so much. That's a big reason why we bully people about forwarding because we're giving this very luxurious experience where you don't have to click through. So why forward? We're giving it to you all in the email. I agree. I think it's, I like that too. And it makes it also that I, even though obviously I write a lot, it makes it so I restrain myself because I know that people are going to just only be able to read the email. Right. Which helps.

Make the switch to Bokeh for the whole family at BOKA.com. In Milan, was there anything else? Did you like Bali? What do you think about Bali? I'm a big fan. I think Bali is interesting. I think I'm interested in seeing where Bali is going. I'm interested in seeing where Todd is going. I also really like to prod a lot. I liked to prod it in the show and I loved how they had reworked the room. The Prada show is always in the same place, but it always looks different. This time, it was very, very different because you were right up close to the clothes. You could hear the metal banging against you. There was a lot of hardware. I really liked the mix of Prada basics, of which I am a consumer of, mixed with extreme fun fashion, retro, futuristic fashion. I liked it even more when I went to the showroom and really looked at it and saw that every look had a different handbag, every look had a different shoe. I thought it was really cool. I thought that was cool and there were really cool people there and it was a cool vibe. I talked to some people that really liked it and some people that didn't really like it. That was my first Bali show and that's 100% on my list now. I definitely will be buying the Black Men's boots. They're so cool. They're just exactly what I want. Exactly. I love it. I think it's a very particular carve out niche of person who is into it. It's like someone who's a little preppy, but who likes high fashion. The first season, I remember, I tweeted, I was trying to still post fashion show looks on Twitter, which I've stopped because what is the point? I remember, I think Joe Ellison DM'd me and was like, yeah, this is really good. Penny Martin really liked it from the beginning. My friend Becky Malinsky and Jacob Gallagher from the journal, we were all really into it. It's also, all of us would wear it and it's our thing. It's this thing of, I think he has interesting ideas and it's also just hitting the nail on a particular aesthetic of a person who works in fashion. Because you love classic American looks or classic clothing, I could see you getting those boots for sure. They're very good. The boots are mine if they come in my size, but I'm interested. The clothes made me interested and tried them on too. I was interested. I'm intrigued by the whole thing. I thought Prada, I really liked it as well. The interesting thing about the two of them is you can really, especially her, but both of them, you can really see how they're feeling through the clothes that they designed, which is the point of fashion, but most designers can't do that. I got the sense that they were really going at it this time, back and forth, a lot of debate. It turned out to be this amazing collection. In backstage, I said to her, I was like, it looked like you were ticked off about something. Are you mad about something that's happening in the world or whatever? I think she thought that I meant she looked annoying, in that moment, which I didn't. Their answers were interesting about the reason they did a different pair of shoes for each or a completely different look for each person was this idea of fighting the algorithm. I thought that was interesting. It felt like they were pushing back against something. Again, when do you go to a runway show and feel like you can actually see an intellectual idea in it? It's pretty rare. Sign me up again and again. I mean, I'm always into it, but I really, really enjoyed this one. I think the clothes look great. Looked good. I really do. So then we got to Paris. Did you go home at all or no? Oh, no, no, no. When would you go home? Well, a lot of people go on Sunday and they don't come back till Friday. If they want to skip Saint Laurent and Dior, they will do that. Why on earth would I skip Saint Laurent and Dior? That's true. Well, first of all, those are two of my big advertisers, but also I need to go to those. First of all, I wouldn't skip anything. I would never skip Picara to the end. I love Paris. Paris loves me, Lord. It's always treated me well. I'm like, I just love going to Paris and I love soaking up the vibe. So I wouldn't want to be missing. I don't want to be, I mean, I go to as much as I can humanly handle. I was listening to you talking about, you know, your mental health skips. Like I'm not, I'm not someone that needs to go to every single thing, but I need to go to every single thing that I'm excited about. That is essential for me. It's hard enough to do this and then like miss some of the big vibes. You know, I want to get, I want to get really the real. True. And I also feel like you're, you have, you wear a lot of hats. You're the editor of a big magazine. So yes, you have to, you know, show face and, and be in the mix, but you also style a lot of commercial things. And also you have this collaboration. You're just like a fashion online personality. And so you, I feel like your presence, if you're not, if you're not at the Kara to, to sort of add to the vibes, it could be, you know, I'm just psyched to go cause I'm interested and well, thank you. But also I really, I really want to go and also in Paris, it's a good idea to just get out there and go to stuff and, you know, I, again, I've got my, my driver, Arash, and he takes me everywhere. He told me we did 110 rendezvous during Paris Fashion Week. And I just love like zipping all over the place and, and seeing stuff. So what did you see that was under the radar that you really, really loved? Is Duran Lantink still under the radar? Cause I absolutely loved it. I think enough. Yeah. I mean, like other than the big, big brands will like, they more indie designers, what did you see that you loved? Duran? Yeah. I mean, I loved, I loved Duran Lantink. I think he is so talented. And I think that he's really doing something interesting. And he's playing with all these avant-garde shapes in a way that's compelling and convincing and also funny and fun. But everyone takes it seriously. And you could think it's the dumbest thing on earth, but still love it. I don't know. It's just got a lot going on for different people. And then I also really liked how he was also making stunning dress. He was doing all these extreme weird shapes, but he was also making these stunning dresses. So I was left wanting more from next season. Like, oh, I'm interested in where this is going. I'm interested in where he's going with like red carpet. But it's his fantasy version of something. I'm interested in these exaggerated shapes. I see them developing. I'm seeing someone that's taking their LVMH prize money, I guess, or their, or their, or people's interest and excitement in them. And they're really stepping it up. So I love seeing that. It's fun. Just see that every season. It's like more of a thing. That's been a show that I feel like everyone in Paris that works in fashion has really decided, all right, can't miss this one. They can't miss this like quote, underground show, you know, and I really got a lot out of that. Also, shout out to the camera because I feel like I was talking to them backstage with me like, you know, five years ago, I remember being like, you need to figure out like one sellable thing that you could actually sell. And now they're one of the top brands at Dover Street and they're making a lot of stuff for many moods of many different people. I think that that's great. Yeah, they're so interesting because they, I remember being backstage with them in New York and then someone asked them a story, a question about their business. And they were like, we have a three tiered business, blah, blah, blah. And I was like, I was, I mean, I write about the business, but I was like, guys, we don't need, you don't need to have a three tiered business. You just need to make interesting stuff at this point. But what I will say is they've been extremely like persistent and they made this change to show in Paris. And it's really impressive. I mean, the biggest challenge in fashion is just being able to like, keep going. And so many designers give up or really fade off. And it seems like they have managed to sort of dig into it and stick around in an environment that makes it really hard for these kids to make it work. I think that moving the show to Paris was a good idea. I don't think it's always a good idea for Americans to move their thing to Paris. For them, it's been a good idea. And I was talking to Adrian Jofi about them afterwards. And he's just very ecstatic about them and about the customer that they've created at Dover. And I think that's so fat. So what else is like an under round thing? Oh, I was listening to you on, on an earlier this week podcast talking about waiting in line at the row for an hour. And I was taking the horn, you got to go to, you got to go to husband because that's, that's, oh, we were talking about husbands actually. We were talking about it. I love husbands because I did go there and I didn't have to wait. And I ordered some shirts and just little boring shirts for husband. They look so good. I think I need to order a shirt from husbands. I think you do. I went in, I ordered, I ordered five this season. I'm really into it. But anyway, I can't remember if I, if I think the Duran and Vicar are my favorite undergounds. Of the big shows, what did you really, really love? Well, actually, funny enough, my favorite collection in Paris is Celine, not a show. But when I went in to look at when I went in to do a reese, I was really amazed at, wow, Eddie really did a thing and really snap. I just felt like one of those moments where he's really snapping and making just unbelievably good clothes that are so ham and they're just so good. And these ones were, you know, all the street elements are taken out of it. And then there was, I think 20 of the looks were couture and they just looked so good. And there's this one leather jacket that I just can't stop thinking about. So insanely good. I also thought Louvée was so brilliant. And I thought it really excited me and made me love fashion. I love being at the show. Love the way the clothes look. I'm excited to work with the clothes. I'm excited to play around. I liked a lot of stuff. But those were, I think the two big guys that I was most into. I think I would agree. Mew Mew too was just beat me. Oh, yeah. It was fab. It was really fab. We talked about it after the show, I think, because we were at LaCos together. Who was that guy we were sitting next to? Wait, what's his name? He's so cute. Wait, hold on. I gotta look up his name. He's so nice. We just did something on the interview. I'm sorry. He's like a movie guy. He's like selling people on movies all the time. Yeah. So I just started talking to him about movies because I knew, but wait, this name is a theater male. Hold on, please. I loved Mew Mew. I mean, I always, I'm a Mew Mew fan of Mew. They really know how to put on a show. They really know how to get you there. I make you really remember them. So like the last, it's like the last day of the shows. They're like cool collection, great music, very good, front row, but we're going to snap cast in a way that we haven't done in a while that's going to remind you that we really got it going on. Yeah. I thought it was, it felt really fresh always. It's just always like boom. And then not, you're right. It's so how dead is every person by that time? And it makes you feel so good. Okay. The guy that we, that was sat between us at LaCosta's Reese Feldman, his Instagram, his guy with a movie camera. I mean, he was just so cute. That's so cute. I love talking to him and yeah, look, curious at the Met Gala. Yeah. He's adorable. Yeah. I loved listening to your conversation. So I have a question as an editor at these shows. Are you like looking for looks and pulling looks for upcoming shoots as you go? Cause you have like, again, you do about 15,000 things and you're styling your, I'm sure you're talking to Darra, your fashion director, but like, are you all, are you all doing that whole methodical email to PR right after and say, I want these five looks type thing or does, you don't have to do that? That's a great question. I mean, I'm definitely talking to Darra, our fashion director, Lucy Gaston, our market director who's at the shows and we're like divide and conquer and Reese's and they go to a lot of the more Reese's than me. I mean, they really see everything and I, and I'm doing a lot of appointments with the brands and the, and we're definitely catching the vibes about what we really like and are talking about it. Yeah. For sure. Was there like a big fashion idea this month that you all were like, very into that, that you kept seeing like any big trends? It feels like that doesn't exist as much as it used to. I mean, I'm definitely, I, for me, one of the things that I'm interested in the futurism that's going on, I'm interested in the like weird seventies stuff that was going on at Mew Mew and Versace and also I saw, I was sorry, Mew Mew and Prada and I saw it at Bottega. I just really liked that. I love Mew Mew. I loved Clara 3000's weird seventies soundtrack as well. So cool. And it's like a mix of like dead stock seventies stuff and futurism that I think is really interesting and that excites me. Also, Chloe, I'd really done Chloe. I know. I really liked it. Did you like it? Yeah. It feels so, it makes you feel really good. Like positivity, like a wash of positivity. And the thing is, it's not, it could go the other way very easily. There's just something about the way she does it, like that blue jacket. It just makes it feel good. And again, like fresh. Like, I don't like using that word to describe things as overused, but I thought that felt really fresh. I thought Mew Mew felt really fresh. And it's in a time when everything feels very heavy and sort of dark. She just like, it's all about light and air and making people feel good. And I would never wear any of those clothes, but it doesn't matter. It's like, I know the woman who would. And that's what's cool. Right. And also, it's like, okay, she understands the assignment. I think she's just a really good fit for that brand. And then when you see that show, you're like, oh, damn, she really gets the assignment. She really knows what the Chloe woman is. She's probably been looking at the Chloe show being like, oh my God, if I was doing this, I would do blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and she knows how to do it. So she's just doing it. I also think when I look at that show, I see something that's so cool and confident about what she's doing. Because I really, I mean, I love the mood board that they show backstage. But to me, I was like, she's taking the best bits of Phoebe Chloe. She's taking the best bits of Stella Chloe. And she's taking the best bits of Carl Chloe or some amazing bits of Carl Chloe. Because I mean, there's so much of that. But yeah, she's taking all that stuff. And then she's doing a fresh, new, confident, her version of, I think it's great. She's just well cast. And I think then that's great. We're about to see a lot of new casting, whether they're good or bad remains to be seen. I have no idea. But that's gonna be really interesting too. You know what I mean? That there's gonna be a lot of change. Some will work really well, some won't. But it's exciting to see it. So, so much of this week had been about like, who's going where, who is negotiating what, all of that stuff. What do you think about, I mean, Eddie leaving was sort of everyone new. But it was like, is he actually going to leave? That was the thing because it, I think his contract ran out in June. And he was basically on a like month to month, not month to month, but collection to collection. That's what I was told. And so there was this kind of question, is he actually going to leave? My guess is that this was very managed and that he was because Michael Ryder, who's now the designer of Celine, he left Ralph Lauren, I think in May or at the beginning of May or the beginning of June. And that was communicated internally there. So, he left to go work in Europe. So if he, I don't know what the actual deal was, but like, what do you think about that change? Where would you like to see Eddie go if he is gonna go somewhere? Well, he is one of the best of our lifetime. So I hope he goes somewhere. He's still in his prime. He is an incredibly brilliant fashion designer and merchandiser and stylist. It's all those things. It's just so interesting. And I can't, I don't know where he's going. I'm really, what do I know? But he's definitely going somewhere. We need him in fashion. He's so good. He's really good. I also love that collection and did, did not go to, I don't usually go to Reese's. Sometimes I'll go to them just if the, I try to go to the Prada, but that's basically it. But anyway, I was sitting next to someone who went to the Reese's at, I think at Gabriella Hurst and we were looking through and she also looked at the Couture collection, I guess. It just looked incredible. It's insane. It looked incredible. It just, it looked so beautiful. And to be, to not be phoning it in when you know you're leaving is kind of remarkable. I mean, obviously great rehearsal for another house, but who knows. Perhaps another house with a very legendary Couture history. I don't know. All I know is that these clothes are phenomenal. And you know, I wish that more people would know that they're as phenomenal as they are, but maybe he's 100% right to not be doing a show. And to be like, I'm just going to make the best clothes and then not do a show and have the right people see them. And I'm going to put out pictures that I really love in a video and the video and the pictures look great too. I mean, they really look great. But wow, when you see the clothes up close and you see there's this black beaded dress that I'm sure in a picture would just look like they have really cool dress, but in person, I'm in awe of the lightness of it and the the modernity of it. And there was this beaded Couture jacket and then there was a ready to wear leather jacket that just really blew my mind. And that's when, and me and Celine in the time that he's been there, which has been six years, it's always like, wow, this leather jacket blows my mind and everyone's going to copy it. And wow, I'm looking at it for the first time. I'm looking at like this particular thing in the first go around and it doesn't matter that it was like maybe a vintage leather jacket from the archives or what. It's amazing. And this is going to be influential. People, people are, everyone's going to know this is it and everyone's going to copy it. Totally. He is very consistent, but also knows exactly what people want. And so he does what he wants for himself, but also for the customer. And I love it. Huge fan. Me too. Really hope. You know, my, my wish is for him to be at Chanel. And if he's at Chanel, he'll have to do shows. So we'll see. But whatever happens, I will follow him anyway.

So one other thing you were working on this past week was the launch of these jeans with Redone. Yes. Which congrats. So tell me about. Thank you. So let's talk about the style of the jeans. It's a 505, like inspired by an vintage 80s 505, can you talk about the 505, what it is and what? Yeah. So I'm wearing vintage 505s right now from the 80s. I'm going to show you. They're pretty high waisted. And the leg is just wider than the knee and below is just wider than the 501, which is a little deeper. I wear 501s too. I just after a while was like, oh, I just realized that I bought a bunch of jeans and I can't stop wearing these ones. And then these ones, I don't think I look as good in it. It was just the 505. And I was like, oh, shit. I mean, I not, it's really just what I think looks good on me. I was like, I think that's a sprain on my ass. It makes my legs look longer than a 501. And so then I had, I've always been aware that redone makes really good jeans, really good t-shirts. They're just high quality stuff. And Sean Barron from redone reached out and asked me if I want to do a collab. And I just instantly said, yes. So I was like, yeah, I've been waiting for someone cool to come at me with an offer because I want to do a good jean. And I think that people will buy jeans for me because I really wear denim a lot. I wear denim on denim a lot too. And then we, I brought my favorite pair of 505s to read on. They told me, and I brought a few pairs, but I was like, this is my favorite pair of the last, okay, all of your 505s that you like are from the 80s, great to know. And then we developed a jean off of that. And then to make a denim jacket, I was like, all right, we got to make a really good denim jacket because I keep losing my denim jacket. And then I'll find one that I like, and then I'll lose it. It's fucking nightmare because I'm like, people are like, where's the denim one? Done. I'm like, I lost my jacket and nothing's cool. I don't like any of these denim jackets. It actually took read on a while to find me a denim jacket that I liked that I wanted to copy. And unfortunately, I lost it in Barcelona. But because you know, sometimes that's warm, you know, September and oops, you lost your jacket anyway. But so we really worked on the fit and it was an effort in going into read on really working on the fits and the washes and it was really fun. And then it just came together. And now I'm really excited that they've launched. I wanted to send it to Charlie XCX first. And I was like, oh, then then she wore the club. Oh, sorry, club metal is what I call my apartment or my state of mind or whatever. Here's, I don't know. It's just like something that I use as a geotag. And I took a Ottenbergs athletic club t-shirt from the 80s. Also 80s. It's like I found in my dad's drawer 30 years ago. And you know, my dad was a fourth generation bread baker. So I think that Ottenbergs athletic club would be like a softball team from the drivers of Ottenbergs bakery or something like that. And I took that and developed the club metal t-shirt with them. And the fit is unisex. And we tried it on myself. We tried it on female models, male models. And we developed something that's unisex sold in women's sizes, men's sizes. There's two washes. We also did an upcycled Levi's 505 program. And I know I'm psyched about them. And I'm glad people are liking them. We launched it first on Redone and that's shop redone.com and on Essence, but it will be in other stores too. It just was so any day now, I think it'll be at Saks at Bloomingdale's at Shop Bop. So I don't know how sold out it is exactly, but there's more. I'm very excited. I bought them. They are, they look ideal to me. I really wanted a medium wash and that cut is good. I wear 501s usually, but yeah, I like that idea of it being a little less tapered. And I do also just feel like generally end up wearing vintage jeans. And I'm happy when someone does like a really great new jean. And also I just personally love your style and feel like I would wear anything. Like I'd wear that sweater you're wearing right now. So good. Thanks, it's Laura Piana. I love it. Yes, it is Laura Piana. It's so good. But you have, you really, to me, I love what you do. I think you're an incredible editor. You have such a sense of like what's happening in the world and bringing that into the magazine in a way that like is so hard to do in this time for publishers. But you also just have an incredible sense of style and like really great American style. I don't know, like if you feel like there's other stuff that's missing in the market that you would love to be able to make for somebody. I feel like you could have like a whole big line of clothes. I mean, it's funny. I always wanted to be a designer. Like that's what I always wanted to do my whole life. Actually, Sean Barron was who was one of the founders of Redone was my first Boston fashion. I was the trim guy at Katya Nadelli in 1999. And Sean was like a business guy at Katya Nadelli. We didn't realize she's so good. She was so good. She was so good. We both didn't realize that when we remade. And after a while, I was like, dude, you were my first boss. Anyway, he was like, whoa, anyway. So I've been so psyched to have done this collab, like really deeply like fun to me to have worked so hard on something and worked so hard on the fit and in the collaboration. And yeah, I want to do more. I mean, I would love to I would love, I love my job. I love being the editor of interview. And it's really fun for me to work in media. But also being the sometimes I just want big brands that I have loved my whole life as a very American person and consumer, I might go be around the world and have lots of worldly experiences. But at least style was I'm always coming back to America. I'm a big American guy, like I just have big American bones and I don't look good in fashion. So like it's really like I even through trial and error realized that the perfect American style is what works on me. And I think it works on a lot of people. But also I think that some of our greatest makers of American fashion need some help. And it would be amazing to work on a big brand. It's like a dream of mine, actually. It's funny because I love what I'm doing. And I love editing interview. I love editing a magazine, but I've always wanted to work on a brand. I've always wanted to be like, okay, if I was in there, I would do this, this, this and this and and through what I do and really making my point of view clear in the way that I make it clear or that people caught on to it, which I really appreciate. I think that working with clothes will be really fun. I think it's the same skill. It's that idea of like, what feels right right now? And how do you like, obviously we use the word zeitgeist way too much, but like you are a you understand what that means. And especially in this era where like culture is so fragmented and there really is no culture, you somehow can like dig in to the Nuzzi, Lisa, RFK thing and get exactly like the like, you know exactly where to take that conversation for your reader or for your audience. And that's what a great brand needs to do now too. Like if you want to be in the conversation and all these brands want to be in the conversation, like yes, it helps sell clothes, but they also want the sort of recognition and you have that ability. I'm sure that you're going to end up being the creative director of like some giant brand. And you'll probably do that and interview at the same time. And then you'll have some like amazing issue where it all sort of comes together, all of that stuff. I started following you really, really closely when you did that big Carolina rara issue. That was three years ago. Thank you. I mean, obviously followed before, but like really closely because you just everyone should like, I bet there are some on eBay, Mel did a whole issue with the brand Carolina rara. And so it was like sort of sponsoring, but also totally editorial. And I just thought it was brilliant. And I was like, give this man all your money brands. Like if I was an advertiser, you would be the number one person on my list because people actually read the magazine, they read the website. And also, when you do do stuff that's like brand driven, it still feels really amazing and cool. And that is basically impossible. And that's what all these, these peril brands need to they need someone to like make it what they do feel real. It's funny that you say that about the like branded content, because my mother and stepfather had a company called the magazine group and they did custom branded content magazines that were from Washington, DC. And they did that forever. So that was so much of what I was hearing at the dinner table wasn't particular. That was not my dream to do it. It's just funny that later on, well, because actually when the the Carolina rara thing was where it really changed for me. That's right. When I was, it was like pre announcement of me being the new editor in chief, but it was, but I had decided that I was because you were the when you were the fashion director before, right? I was the creative director, creative director. And then when I started interviewing people to become the next editor in chief, when our former editor chief, Nick Kermis left after a few interviews, I was like, damn, I'm going to be the next editor. Yeah, yeah, you were. Wow. Okay. Like it just like came to me like, oh, yeah, this is all going to make sense to just like be the guy and do the stuff that I think is right for a magazine that I really love and that I have this like really clear idea about past, present, and future. And that was just the moment that it all really started changing. And I loved that Carolina rara project. And that was like a real, really inspiring moment for me to just start doing my thing. But also coming back to my parents, I, you know, it's always been really funny to think like, wow, guys, like, I really wasn't this was not the path that I was thinking of doing, but I think I have a real passion for working with brands and doing branded content and making it really good. Like that's that's the future in a lot of ways. And goddamn it, it's going to be good. It's a post selling out world. And you are at the center of it. And I'm not. I would also say that like, yeah, cool. Thank you. No, I'm a big fan. Thanks, dude. I appreciate that. And I am I like working. I like the branded side. I like working with our publisher, Jason Nickits. And I like doing like, I really like working with the brands. I also really like during fashion week, I will say a huge thing that I do is meet with all of our advertisers. And it takes up a huge amount of time. And that's really the important part that's fun because you can can you can tell vibes of what's going on and get the goss and yeah, Mel, thank you for taking the time. Maybe we could do this at the end of every fashion month, but next time I won't sleep in. Okay, well, this time I'll we'll talk. I think we should I think thank you for not trying to get me on the record about anything. But now I think we should place some depths on a phone call right after this. Okay, let's do it. Let's do it. You're the best. Thank you and happy fashion. Thanks, Lauren. Fashion people is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck, hosted by Lauren Sherman. That's me.
