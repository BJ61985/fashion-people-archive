So Blake Brown is Blake Lively's uniquely scented haircare line, which launched right around the time that movie that she did last year, I remember the name of, launched in. It's been a tricky, near year of business. Rachel also had a great estate lotter scoop. I have a very fun speculative piece on the Vanity Fair head of content hunt or editorial of whatever it is. It's definitely not the titles, not editor in chief. I also have a bunch of intel from Europe, Louisa via Roma, some rumors that were going on around that weren't true, and also just some intel about generally how luxury is doing and what might happen next in the market. Shapiro is back with the week that was in shopping. It was a very busy week. She's talking about all the spectacle, spectacle. There's a lot of smart glasses happening right now, and she has an interesting take on that. Never thought I'd say interesting and spectacles in one sentence, but it's true. She is also getting in a little bit into Everlane's rebrand. I think we'll explore that more in the coming weeks. There's just a whole lot going on. I hope you enjoyed this interview with Erin and Sarah. I think many of you watched Nobody Wants This, and many of you shop Favorite Daughter, and many of you listened to their podcast. That's what we call Flywheel people. We talk about the Flywheel. We talk about a bunch of the business-y stuff, their investment thesis. It's a really fun episode. I hope you enjoy it. Erin Foster and Sarah Foster, welcome to Fashion People. Thank you. You're having us. Thanks, Lauren. Thanks for being here. I'm so excited to have this conversation to start. What'd you all have for breakfast this morning? Okay. I made a smoothie with my Sakura greens in it and took it down to the gym with me, and then now I'm having my coffee. I had a large cup of black coffee with about four spoons of sugar. Very nutritious. I thought about lying. I thought about being like I had avocado toast because I had that yesterday. I was like, can't lie. I'm not going to lie to Lauren. I would say that that might be the most fun thing that anyone has had for breakfast since we started to. A coffee with sugar? Yes. It's not normal. I don't recommend it. I always say don't ever do what I'm doing. I tell our audience that all the time. But Sarah also does a thing where she's like, I just drink black coffee, which is a very cool thing to say, but then she adds a part about four spoons of sugar, which doesn't make it a black coffee. True. But what I would say is I feel like sugar is such the enemy in our culture at the moment that anyone who uses sugar and is open about it, I respect and appreciate because it's all in moderation, right? Four spoonfuls. Well, it's organic, I'll say. The caveat is it is organic. And then the other thing to that is you got to pick your poison. For me, I need coffee with my sugar, but then I'm not eating donuts at night. So it's like, you pick your poison. I agree. I feel this way. I'm always like, I'm going to save by skinny margarita so I can have dessert. Save the sugar for the chocolate. Exactly. So we're going to talk about many things today. And prior to recording, we were chatting about our mutual friend Claire Mazer, who when I told them I was going to interview you all, and she had been the one to suggest it in the first place. But she mentioned there's this word in startup universe, flywheel, that is used often. And she said, you know, they are really the best example of a flywheel that works and that actually exists and is a legit thing. So I want to talk about flywheels. That is a word that has never been used on fashion with people before. But we are really here to talk about favorite daughter, your incredibly successful fashion brand. And maybe let's start with everyone who's listening to this knows who you are. But if they don't explain who you are and what you all do, you're not a married couple, you're sisters. We're sisters. We're not a lesbian couple. I don't think everyone knows who we are. That's for sure. So let's tell them who we are, Erin. Okay. Well, I would say that we are sisters who grew up in Los Angeles and we went into entertainment. We did not go into fashion. I am a TV writer and Sarah and I are producing partners and we had a show together like what 12 years ago or something that we created together called Barely Famous that was really our first thing we ever did together, working together. Because Sarah had been an actress before. I was trying to be a writer and we put our heads together and created this mockumentary style show that was a comedy. And it really changed the path of our careers and that was really the trajectory that we were on. And then it kind of pivoted to some other things. We got into business, we got into investing and eventually we had this amazing opportunity to start a clothing brand with our financial partner, Centric Brands and the rest is history. And you also have a podcast. We have a podcast. And so this is where we'll talk more about the flywheel after we get into this. Who doesn't have a podcast? I mean, really, everyone has a podcast. But we felt like we were one of the last people to have a podcast. Our agent Jean, who's incredible, was always like, you guys, you got to start a podcast. It will end up being sort of the nucleus of, because it's really the only place you go to hear really Aaron and I. Social media is kind of a heightened version. Aaron's not even on social media anymore. So the podcast really has been this place where we've cultivated a real relationship with our listeners who then become our favorite daughter customers, who then buy the consumer brands that we're investors in, who then go and watch Nobody Wants This, the show that Aaron wrote and I produced. So that's the flywheel. The flywheel is it's all the same woman and man, we do have male listeners also. It's really the same consumer who's participating in all the things. Harvard Business School needs to do a case study on you all about your flywheel because it doesn't. Most flywheels are total bullshit, but you actually have one. But can I say though, we didn't sit down and go, what's our flywheel? That was never an intention. The flywheel really came out of, I would say, us trying to see what our career path should be. Like, okay, I'm trying to write a show, but the show just didn't get picked up. So then this person comes to us and says, Whitney Wolfe comes to us in 2017 and is like, do you want to work at Bumble? We don't know how to do that. We don't even know what that entails. And she's like, I just have a feeling that you guys know what women are looking for and you can speak to women. So she hires us. That sends us down this business path and we're like, okay, maybe this is our path and maybe the TV stuff isn't going to work out for us. And I guess that has to be okay. And then we get the favorite daughter opportunity. We think, well, this is a very cool path for us. And I think that, you know, it's all about follow through, right? Because you can start a million things. But what Sarah and I have been really lucky with is that we have partnered in every one of the things that we're talking about. We've partnered with really smart people who teach us how to be in that lane and how to do it well. We can't pretend like we would have known how to start an investment fund and run it by ourselves. We have a partner, Phil Schwartz, who teaches us and who guides us all the time. We didn't start favorite daughter by ourselves in our garage. We would not have been able to turn it into what it is today at all. We don't understand the supply chain or we didn't at that point, right? So we have a partner who teaches us those things. Like we have a great producer on our podcast who teaches us how to keep it consistent and how to get, you know, we have an ad sales person. It's not like we're doing this on our own. We know how to partner with the right people so that we can have the follow through so it could be successful. I think the idea of not knowing, knowing what you don't know is so important in business. 100%, I would also say too that there would also be no favorite daughter if we hadn't done this collaboration with this t-shirt company. And when this t-shirt company asked, Hey, do you guys want to do a collaboration? I'm not going to lie. I sort of felt like that feels small. That feels so niche. Like that came at a time where I was kind of like, who am I? What am I? What am I even doing? I'm doing this little t-shirt collaboration where I'm not going to make any money. No one's going to see it. I'm not a designer. Who am I? And without that little collaboration, there would be no favorite daughter. So it also, I would say, not only has it been this very not straight line of taking new opportunities, but also doing things that you aren't quite sure where it's going to lead, doing things that don't have a clear path to that thing that you think you want to be doing or should be doing. Does that make sense? For sure. And let's talk about that, that collaboration and what it was and how it did end up becoming a multi-million dollar company. Well, that came through Aaron. Well, okay. Do you know this company? They're called Suburban Riot. Do you know who they are? They made like the kale sweatshirt. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. For sure. Okay. They made this kale sweatshirt at the Beyonce War in a music video. Sorry. It said kale later looked like Yale. Well, starting it from a par churches in Vladivostok where there's stuff sometimes. They reached out to me and they were like, would you ever want to do a little collaboration? I was like, sure, do you mind throwing a bone to my sister and letting her being a part of it. And they're like, sure Sarah can be a part of it. Sarah and I go to Hugo's and we signed a contract without even a lawyer. We were just like, sure, let's do a t-shirt collab, Yeah. We literally didn't have a lawyer. We literally, she's not exaggerating. They were like, okay, here are the papers. We're like, cool, Sarah, we didn't talk to anyone about it. We just thought like, I don't know, sure, we'll do a t-shirt collab, we just didn't think that much about it. We liked the brand. They made sweatshirts and t-shirts that said cute things. So then we came up with all these different phrases and things to put on them. I really thought that my ideas were gonna do really well. I had like dying alone with a cat on it. I had like currently peaking. I had like, like undiscovered model. And Sarah was like, why don't we do one that says favorite daughter? Because we had this LLC with our sisters called favorite daughter. Because our sisters and I had to put together this LLC for something for our dad. So we, I came up with this name, favorite daughter. 10 years before. Just as a duo. Like 10 years. Yeah. Right? Every family. Who is the favorite daughter? It's me. It's me. Do people ask you that every single interview? Yeah. Yeah, sorry. But the difference is, Erin's really excited to be the favorite daughter. I like don't care. I'm like, I don't, I really don't care. Just why you're not the favorite. Cause you don't care. I'm like, I got my own problems. I can't worry about, you know. Anyway, so then Sarah's like, I want to do this shirt. And they write favorite daughter with a heart on it. And I was like, I don't love it. It's like cutesy. I don't know. It's like, so like feels so junior. I don't know. And, but we were doing like 20 things. So we did it. That fucking shirt. Oh, can you swear on this Erin? Oh yeah, you could swear. Oh, okay. That's a fuck. This is an NPR. That one shirt sold $2 million, $2 million of income from that one shirt. And we realized that parents were buying it for like, you know, three or four of them at a time. They'd buy them for all their kids and then they'd wear them in a photo. It was like a, like a kitschy thing. And it, it became a thing. So then from that, this woman, was it Jen or Suzy Jen? I think Jen Stender Hawkins, she who runs our company now, favorite daughter with us. She DM me and she was like, She DM both of us. Yeah, but I was the only one who responded. I didn't respond. And said, I have this idea. I feel like we should create. You guys, someone's like typing or something. I'm like hearing crazy, crazy things in my ear. I got a text. I'm sorry. Oh, oh, oh, oh, Jess. I don't care. I'm just saying, is this gonna be okay for sound? Oh yeah, no. It's fine. Okay, fine. But I won't do it again. That was rude. I'm sorry. I guess my story is like really boring. I just got like an annoying text that I was like, I have to deal with this, but I'm done now. Please, I literally don't care, but Erin, you gotta land the plane. You're really dragging this story out. Clearly. The point is, is that Jen Stender Hawkins DMed me and Sarah and said, I think that there's really smart IP in favorite daughter. And I think that it could be its own brand, its own fashion brand. They took us out to lunch. And I mean, it's not something that had ever occurred to us before, but these women were working at Centric. They were running brands like Joe's and Air Véliger. And they had like, you know, they had a history of taking brands and, you know, those brands were making a lot of money. And they wanted to do something. They had had this idea to have a talent facing brand, but they didn't know who to do it with. And it all kind of merged for them. And they thought like, we wanna test this out. So they really campaigned with Jason Rabin, who started Centric to say like, trust us, we think that this could work. And his daughter actually, Morgan was like, no, no, they're good. Like I think that it would be a good idea, but Centric had never incubated a brand from like, from start to, we were sort of like a case study in a lot of ways. And I remember saying to Aaron, I don't get it. Like we're not fashion designers. We don't even care really about fashion. Who's gonna buy clothes from us? I swear to God, I remember thinking, this is a very bad idea. Well, it ended up being a good idea. Really quickly on Centric. So it's one of these brand management firms, which means you mentioned, like they don't usually incubate brands. They take brands like Joe's Jeans that already are very well established and manage them. They're a big licensing. They do a lot of licenses too. So when they, so you think this is a bad idea, why did you say yes? And what were sort of how, as people who maybe you don't feel like you care about fashion, but you're, I would say maybe the better way to say it from my perspective is that you're not like obsessed with designer clothes or whatever. You just wanna be comfortable. Right, I guess the right way to say it would be, we are not obsessed with the culture of the fashion business or the scene or the fashion shows. It's just, we respect it, but it's never been anything that we've felt like, maybe we would have, we just never really felt a part of it to be honest with you. We're not people that get invited to all those things. So at the time, it just wasn't anything that was on our mind, but what was on our mind is that we wanna look and feel good, that we run in circles with people who do care about those things and are part of those things. So we wanna look good, but we don't wanna look good having to spend, $5,000 on a jacket. So that was the hook. We were like, okay, what if the brand thesis is really us? It's like, we wanna look good, we wanna feel good, we wanna be in tailored clothes that are so nicely good quality fabrics, but for a price that makes us feel okay. And why did you feel like Centric was the right partner? Because they were excited about it and wanted to do it with you or was it, what was it about them that made you feel like, okay, it's worth taking this risk? Well, it was their idea. It was their idea. There was no doing it without Centric. Many people advised us, just do this on your own. Like why would you give up half of the business to somebody else, but we never even considered doing this on our own. Running a business is so hard and there are so many challenges that are always threatening to take you down. We were not in a position to take that on by ourselves without people who were experienced in this field and in this lane able to support us and guide us. So there was no doing it without Centric. If it wasn't gonna be a Centric, then we just weren't gonna do it. They also, it was a great meeting too. They were very clear. The vision was so clear for them. They just saw it. They saw it. They saw that combining Aaron and I with the IP, with the name, Favorite Daughter, it lends itself to so many categories. They saw it. We did not see it. I did not see it. Maybe Aaron saw it. I didn't see it, but they saw it. And that has served us well in all of the ventures that we have participated in. Teaming up with people who are clear and confident in the road. Each spring, 23 Pulitzer Prizes are rewarded for distinguished journalism, books, drama, and music. There was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination, go into creating their prize winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out it was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not wanna live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th. Follow and listen on Apple podcasts, the Odyssey app, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcast. So what year did you watch? 2020, great year. Which five years? It's amazing. It's amazing how well executed this all has been and how well it's fit into your flywheel and all that stuff. But so you launched 2020, what does that first collection look like? What were the things that you all felt like? I'm sure they came to you and said, these are the items that you should have, but what did you all feel like should be in this collection other than the sweatshirt and the merch element? Well, it started as like, what's missing from Sarah's closet, what's missing from Aaron's closet? Aaron and I have really different style. We have different style. Half the time I wear things, she's like, you look terrible. We don't necessarily... I'm like, yes. I'm shaking my head, yes. And I'm like, what? No, I don't know. So that's how it started, but this was the end of 2020. And then everything got stuck overseas. So then we pivoted to a masked hoodie. Yeah, that was funny. We really launched with that. That was like a big thing. But also, I mean, I look back at our first collection and I'm horrified, because there's a lot that we had to learn working with Cintrick and a lot that Cintrick had to learn working with us. For instance, we had some ideas that wouldn't necessarily make sense when you put them into practice, but Cintrick at the beginning was like, whatever Aaron and Sarah want, we want to implement. So I may have said, like, I want a dress with buttons down the front and cutouts on the side. I want it to be this material. Well, each item of clothing has to have a fabric that makes sense. It has to have a cut that makes sense. The button has to make sense. The seam has to make sense. Everything goes together. And we were coming in flying blind. So we made some things that, like, looking back, we would never make that mistake today. You know what I mean? Like, we now have learned from them about how each garment has to work. I mean, Sarah's obsessed with fabrics, obsessed with knowing this has to have stretch and this has to have this and this isn't going to be dyed properly. And those are things that we had to learn. So I look back and I'm like, you know, it was a real starter. I am obsessively compulsive about fabric and fit because at the end of the day, Aaron and I are on the hook for things that don't work. We have a direct connection to our customer. They write us. They're going to write us and say, this is itchy. This is terrible. I just spent, you know, $250 of my hard earned money on this thing that you told me is great. It's itchy. So we think about that. Like, we talk to our girls and nothing makes us happy. We know that we're in the price point where people are spending money that they have saved up for. We know that. And we didn't realize honestly that we would also have the girl that can wear anything she wants. That's been the most surprising thing to me is like we have the girl who buys luxury, you know, Dior, Celine, all these things. And she's writing us going, I'm not buying the Celine belts anymore. I'm only wearing the favorite daughter belts. That is something I think we did not, I did not think would happen. Well, in some ways it's like you all are the proto of that. You, as you said, like you hang in circles where people wear a lot of designer clothes. You have access to designer clothes. But you are like, I don't want to spend, the price value equation for a lot of those clothes is not computing for people anymore. And so they want something that feels good, like you said, quality, but like it doesn't seem insane to spend that much money. Also, I think that's something else that really works for favorite daughter is that some of the talent front facing brands, they don't echo who that person is out in the world. And for Sarah and I, favorite daughter really represents how we dress and who we are as people. This is what we're wearing to a fancy dinner with our fashion friends. And it's what we're wearing day to day. It's what I'm wearing to work. It's genuinely the clothes that we, it's like really authentic to who we are. And I think other people may have gotten into it because they want to make money or they're seeing like their Forbes cover way down the line. They're not sitting there in the fittings obsessively like we are meticulously making the clothes that we want to wear. Because Sarah and I, while we might not, you know, present to people as like the everyday girls, we really do function in a lot of ways like that girl. We know who the girl is that's like 27 in her first job in New York city and she wants the blazer that she sees, you know, on the Kate runway, but she can't afford it. Like that girl has more in common with us than we do with our fashion friends. So we understand that girl. It's true. I mean, Lauren, you know, we have never, and this isn't just like us trying to, to inhabit some sort of personality. We have never at any point in our lives been the girl who walks into Louis Vuitton and buy something. I mean, it's just, it's just never happened. It's just we've never been that, and by the way, there's nothing wrong with that person. It's just not who we are. We have a mom who like shops on Montana, you know, like that's our vibe. Yeah, that's what I was going to ask. Do you think that has to do with just your personal taste or do you think that's a value thing that your parents kind of instilled? We, our mom is like very chic and she shops on Montana. And that's where she gets to- You should explain what Montana is, Erin, for the lesson. Oh, sorry. Well, Montana is a street in Santa Monica and it's got a lot of linens. And it's like earthy and it's, it's like small shops, you know, there's not like big brands, brands there. And she, she does like a lot of high low, you know, she might want to get a nice bag for herself that she'll wear for 10 years. And it'll be her favorite bag. But she just puts herself together in a very accessible way. And she's not a person, like I think something that she really instilled in us is, is not presenting in a showy way or a materialistic way. She never was impressed with the women who were like bags, shoes, jewelry. Like that's just not her energy. So we didn't grow up in a house that was focused on that. I mean, don't get me wrong though. I love my Minolos and I love, you know, I wear a row coat that I bought on sale at the Outnet. Okay. And I'm obsessed with it. I'm upset. It's the chicest, it's the scuba coat. It's so chic. I look on Moda when Moda's doing their 60, 70 off. That's when I'm going to buy a coat. Don't get me wrong. I want a row coat. I want a Kate dress. I for sure do. They're so chic. There's just something about spending $2,500 on a dress. I cannot, maybe if I was like a billionaire, I'd think differently, but I don't think so. Like I just cannot wrap my head around it. I don't know if I feel like guilt. It just doesn't feel like how I want to spend my money that I work really hard for. I think that is a sentiment that a lot of people feel, including some billionaires who are like, yeah, I can buy all this stuff, but it's kind of dumb. It just starts to feel dumb at some point. But I don't want to act like we don't love nice things, like we just did a commercial for Chase, which was like a big, you know, it's going to be like a national commercial. It's a big deal. Yeah, it's a big deal. Right. We would have dropped that in there, Sarah, like that. And our sister, Jordan, is our stylist. And I said to her, I was like, oh, I'll probably get to keep like what I wear. Right. She's like, well, yeah, I go, there's a Gabriella, her stress I've been dying for. But like, I'll never go buy it. You know, so I, but I got that Gabriella stress. So we do like designer clothes. It's just a, you get what I'm saying. Totally. I think it's a valid point of view and helps explain why this has resonated. So when did you all, because the first time I realized it was going to be a thing was, do you know this woman, Madeline Hill, she does this podcast called the sports gossip podcast, but I've known her since she was in college. She's just like a very interesting, she was like very early social media editor type person and she was a former teen model. And she, when she was like in grad score or something, she was wearing a lot of your stuff and kept saying, favorite daughter is so good on her social media. And I thought Madeline, who understands the fashion world, was involved in the fashion world, had access to these kinds of clothes, is buying the stuff. It's going to be a thing. And when did you all start to feel that word of mouth element of it, like DMS on social media, that sort of thing? It's a good question. It is a good question. There was a point where, I don't know what the point, where the point is, but there was a point where we went from kind of desperate to get people to wear our clothes to people asking to wear the clothes, us trying to push it, where people asking for it, like us pushing our friends to like, hey, get this pair of jeans to our friends saying, hey, I like those Jordy jeans, like can you send them to me in my size? That it just became like a shift from us wanting it to be a thing to it being a thing. And I think it's a slow progression. I mean, I'm sure you're familiar with like, sometimes there could be a micro influencer, like a random mom that has 3000 followers and like, she'll sell out a trench coat for us. And then there's going to be like a person with 20 million followers and like, nothing. I think I remember Lauren Santodomingo posted, LSD posted herself in her dentist's office wearing the favorite trouser. And that was like, whoa, you know, LSD is not trying to do favors for people. She is a business woman. She is the chicest. She's not going out into the world wearing a pair of trousers for a, for a, you know, she's not going to be nice to you guys if she doesn't, she's not going to, she does feels no obligations to be nice to you about this stuff. She's a nice person. She is a very nice person. Yeah. And we'll always be supportive and all those things, but there's a very big difference in, because early on I would ask her advice and there's a very big difference between, oh, yeah, that, yeah, you know, looking at sketches and then actually wearing the garment out into the world in New York City. So I remember when I saw that, I was like, whoa, that is crazy. And it's not like a t-shirt. It is a pair of pants. You know, like, I also think that like, I don't know how other people approach their businesses, but Sarah and I are not, there's no point where Sarah and I become hands off. There's no point where we go, okay, it kind of runs itself. It's never going to run itself. Sarah and I are in every fitting. Now I've not been as present with the TV show lately. So Sarah like really holds up, you know, her end and she'll send me pictures and stuff, but we are in every single fitting looking at every single thing going like, we thought that was going to hit the ankle, but it's definitely hitting the calf and that looks weird. And we think that that seam doesn't look right there. And that fabric doesn't feel like we thought it was going to feel like we are obsessive and I don't see a point where that changes. We had thought when we started it, like, we'll be in the first few fittings, then we'll sort of let it run. But the truth is like, we have to be hands on because it's us. And it's, and we, we're going to care about it more than anyone else. Not only is it us, but this is it. If this doesn't work, we're not going to go start another fashion brand, you know, like it's like, this is it. And we look, we treat it like that every day. This is our only opportunity is how we look at this is like, our dad used to always tell us, Erin, I'll probably butcher it, but like the microphone comes around one time, you know, you better grab it. And this is our one time in this lane. Yeah, we'll do other things. Wow, words of wisdom. I know, I know, but it's true. It's true. And so we do not take this opportunity for granted for one second. We know how lucky we are to have found the partners we have to, to be in this opportunity. To echo what Erin said earlier, if we were doing this on our own, we would not be a profitable business. The only way that we are profitable is because we have linked up with Centric, who allows us to utilize all their other things that don't even touch our P&L, which makes us have a profitable business. I mean, a lot goes into having a profitable business, but we just don't take it for granted. And I think that when you sit in your gratitude, not to sound cheesy, but I think we now know it works. Yeah, we're not like coasting. Like we feel excited to be here, lucky to be here, grateful to be here, and we're not going to fuck it up. Yeah.

Speaking of not fucking it up, what has been the biggest, like what are the, I assume denim is a big category for you, but what are the styles that have really hit with people that you feel like are emblematic of this thing that you're building? Actually, denim is not as big for us as you would think. Interesting. We want it to be bigger. I mean, we want to start investing into denim campaigns and things like that because our denim is really good. But as you know, denim is tough. The customer is married to their denim. It's very hard to get a customer. Our denim is so good. It's all I wear. I mean, obviously. I love it so much. It's so good. But we are working to make it a bigger category. It's really suiting, I would say, is the biggest category for us. And coming up with creative suiting, like we have something called the Phoebe Boostier. And it's like suiting, but it's strapless and it holds you in and it has buttons down the front and it has a matching trouser and a matching blazer. And I do think that that item, it kind of broke us out of this. There's a crossroad between suiting and fashion. And I think right now, kind of like in the 80s, like suiting is really fashionable. And it's fashionable to wear a blazer to the office. It's not dorky. It's cool. And so we blazers are very dorky. Ours are just really chic. Sure. But the concept of wearing a blazer is in a good place right now. And we're really playing into the cool working woman and how she wants to dress at work. And then also being able to wear that out at night and still feel cute. So that's been like a real sweet spot for us. We always say we want to do suiting kind of different, like with a little bit of a feminine twist. Like, yes, having your oversized blazers with maybe a little shoulder pad and a tailored waist. But then also we've been leaning into skirts. So like mini skirts, you know, in a suiting fabric, mini skirts with a short underneath it, with a little vest and an oversized blazer. And we're doing those in like colors and an electric blue in yellow. So girls, I feel like a lot of girls are in their sort of feminine era. So we're giving them suiting with a little bit of a feminine twist. And that's selling really well for us. Do you all feel, and I actually don't know how old you are, my guess is late 30s. I'm not gonna, you don't have to say it. I don't know if you all, I don't usually ask people how old they are. That's very sweet. I don't like asking personal questions, but do you all feel like, you mentioned feminine, do you feel like there's also something with your generation that is about like being looking like a little sexier than you did in your 20s? Sarah and I have very different takes on this. Sarah is very into sexy. And I'm not as into sexy or I guess what is sexy is a little different to us. Because I feel sexier when I'm wearing kind of layered drapey things. But I do think that our generation of women are struggling to figure out the masculine and the feminine, the working mom with the housewife. Like we are trying to figure out that balance of where we sit because there's been a lot, there was a lot of pressure on our generation as women to do everything and do it at like a very high level. And so we're always trying to figure out what that balance is. Yeah. What about you, Sarah? What do you think? I don't know you guys. I mean, can I just be honest? I don't, I don't know that I even think about it. I don't know. Maybe there's, as you get older, you care less and less how people view you. I'm actually in my 40s and I wear crop tops and I wear a dress with like a high slit in it and where some people might be like, oh God, like at your age, I literally do not care. Like I work out like a psycho. I'm really healthy. I take a lot of supplements. I'm more fit now than I was in my 20s. I didn't care about my body. I chain smoked. I was skinny, but I was, I didn't lift weights. I was, I wasn't healthy in my 20s. And in my 40s, I feel, I think a lot better about myself in so many ways. I feel better about myself mentally more than anything. So I don't know. I just don't really care what people say anymore. I mean, I do, but I don't. You know, it's funny you mentioned that being in your 40s and wearing what you want and then also sports, because I do think sports are having a real moment. So the fact that you all are just like, understand that and already making that stuff is great, but I had a conversation with a friend of mine. I'm 40, I'm going to be 43 and my friend is, I think 45. And I, there was a scort that I really liked and she was like, I can't, I'm too old to wear that. And I was like, I'm not too old to wear that. No, but I don't think I'd wear just a mini skirt with nothing under it. Like, I don't know. I just, I've never been a person that wears really short things without tights. I think I just, I don't know. Like, I just, we're not big leg people, you know, I don't, I don't know. But the, when you have a short under the mini skirt, you just feel a little better. At least I do. Maybe I'll try the favorite daughter's scort. I, I'm not, I have, I'm, my legs are the only part of my body that I'm not that I feel comfortable with. So I've always been like, it's fine because I'm going to wear like a big T-shirt with the skirt. But I just like the, I think the scort is so cute. It really is. It's so cute. Kiki. And with an oversized blazer, it's, it's a vibe. So let's discuss how favorite daughter, because since favorite daughter launched five years ago, A, it's been incredibly successful, very successful for Centric. I bet they're looking at you and thinking, wow, I mean, they don't have part, you're, you all are very special. So that's part of the reason it's been so successful. But since then, I mean, you have this podcast that's very successful. Nobody wants this has become a phenomenon. You have this, as we were talking before, this startup flywheel that means basically nothing to most people. You have created a flywheel. Tell me the ecosystem of how all this works together and sells more stuff and build your global business that you are creating. It works. It works very well together in a way that we didn't even know was going to happen. You know, like when I was taking time away from favorite daughter to work on the TV show, the TV show hadn't come out yet. I had no idea what was going to happen, right? I knew it was taking up a lot of my time. I knew that I wasn't able to be in fittings. And I, we would do fittings sometimes. So four times a year, we do proto reviews where it's like, you got to see it in person. You got to feel it. It's important. And so the whole office from downtown would come to the writer's room last year, and we would do eight AM proto reviews with a model. And then the writers would come into the room at 10 AM and like see a model walking around changing in the bathroom. And we were trying to like get it all done. And I'm like so grateful with how much everyone was accommodating to my schedule. And I was just feeling guilty that it was taking me away from the business. When the show came out, you know, there's not a ton of favorite daughter in the show, because there's a few reasons for that. Disney, which is 20th, which is our studio. They've got very serious, like, you know, legal boundaries about any kind of quid pro quo stuff. And so the costume designer, she pulled favorite daughter. If she liked favorite daughter, she paid the discounted rate that she pays for any other brand, brought it to the talent, anything that they liked in fittings, and that they wanted to wear great, if they don't want to wear it great. There's no like pushing of it. So I didn't really think it was going to have a big effect on favorite daughter. And then when the show came out and it was a hit just by osmosis, it like completely blew up our sales in the best way possible. And I was like, okay, well, it makes sense that I took so much time away. You're welcome. I didn't realize it was going to be a good thing. And by the way, we gain listeners on the podcast because people kept going, oh, the real life podcast is the world's first podcast. That is nothing I ever anticipated either. No. So all of it is, it's not like we're going like, oh, wow, this happened without us meaning for it to. It's just that we focus on each lane individually and try to be as present and do as well as possible in whatever lane we're in at that time. And then it sort of has like a unintentional synergy between all of these things. That's great. Like Sarah's the one who kind of came up with this idea when we were having a conversation with Booth at Women's Wear Daily where she was like, the girl who's watching the TV show is wearing favorite daughter, is drinking Julia wine, is reading 831 books, is listening to the podcast. It's like she's the same girl. And that's, I don't know if it's a happy accident or if it's intentional somehow, but it's amazing for us to witness. I would say that the thing that has been intentional with us is we made a decision when we took the bumble position, when we became creative directors of the company in 2017. We were like, we need to start coming from the place of yes. We need to start taking opportunities when they come. We need to start betting on ourselves. We need to start taking risks. We need to start living for so long when you're a struggling actress or a struggling writer. Every day you were at the mercy of someone else's decision. Are you good enough? Will they pick you? And when you live like that, I lived like that my entire 20s and then up until honestly, like 33 years old, I guess we started, we created Barely Famous when I was 33, I guess. Yeah. And that is when things changed for us, when we bet on ourselves. And it's been a long ride. This is not some overnight situation, but yes, we did not sit there with a Ouija board going like, ooh, like let's have this flywheel. And that wasn't the plan. And favorite daughter when we were focusing on it in COVID when it launched, I was honestly feeling self-conscious that I wasn't a writer anymore. You know, I was like, maybe my TV career is not going to happen. And maybe that's okay. Maybe I'm going to be, you know, it wasn't my dream to have a clothing brand. It was just this like cool thing that came into our lives that I really enjoyed. But was it like the thing I was put on this earth to do, like I was meant to be a writer, like I felt that pull inside of me to be a writer, you know, I felt like I was kind of abandoning that. And so the fact that they can merge now is like the ultimate success for me. And it feels like you all are not, I see a lot of people can get a little too myopic and too focused on this thing needs to point A needs to get me to point B needs to get me to point C. And it does feel like whatever you all are working on, you put your everything into it. And that's part of the reason that it all has come together. Like you said, Erin, about you, you still felt the ambition to have success as a writer. And I will say, I mean, you all grew up here. The thing that is craziest to me about this industry, Hollywood and living here as someone who works outside of it is the like, you just don't know, everybody's just waiting for decades for something to happen. I can't imagine operating like that. So it takes a lot of patience, but it does feel like you took hold of your own destiny in some way. But at the same time, didn't let the like tiny, tiny little details of how that you were going to get there, hang you up and like drag you down. Well, you have to have a certain amount of faith, you know, that like, I'm also really comfortable with failure. Like I'm used to it. And I'm like, you know what, if this doesn't work, that has to be okay. Everything has to be okay. Like, you can't put all your eggs in one basket. I remember when I finished the nobody wants this and I finished editing it, I looked at it and I was like, I can't tell if this is good or not. I think my friends will make fun of me for it. And that's all I can say. I think they will make fun of me for it. And that's all I know. And if it fails, then I tried. I really fucking tried. And I put my all into it. And I think that that is kind of how you have to approach things, because you have to take the risk and be willing for it to not work. And also, if you have friends, we're going to make fun of you for anything. I think that's going to get some new friends. That is honestly like in LA, it is true, though. People are so fucking judgmental. And that is something that Aaron and I have dealt with. You know how many people talk shit about us when we took the bumble position? Like, so many people talk shit about like, oh, they're going to go take this tech job. And then like, what do you see like a couple years later, everyone's looking for a different brand to, you know, be the chief creative officer for the chief, whatever. And I'm not saying we started that trend, but we've taken a lot of shit. When we started doing barely famous people, like, oh, what are they doing? Blah, blah, blah, you know. And then all of a sudden people are like, oh, shit, like how do we create a barely famous. So we kind of just keep our head down. We know people talk shit, because that's what people do. But you know what we've realized? And it's not like I've never talked shit, of course, I have. But I think that you hope that I have talked shit. No, but listen, you know, this world that we're all sort of living in or circle hovering over is just judgmental and jealous. And it's a huge bummer, which is why my circle is small. Like, I really only surround myself now with people who are happy for my wins, you know. And unfortunately, not everybody is. Well, I'm happy for your wins. I love it. And my last question for you all is you're also investors in different companies. What do you at this point, you've been doing this, you've been working together and building businesses for what 15 years? Not that long. I mean, barely famous. I was, you know, I don't know, like 11, yeah, 11 years. 10 years. Yeah. What do you see right now in entrepreneurship or brand building that you think is exciting? What are you looking for as investors? What do you, when you meet a founder, like, what do you all think, okay, that person has it? Or I want to support this person's attempt at having it? I would say there needs to be some sort of innovation in what we're looking at. You always have to look at who else is doing what you're trying to do in your space. You also want a founder to be really clear and confident in what they're building. Because as an investor, like, you can't feel confident in somebody who isn't confident in what they're doing. So that's really huge. I think women's, yeah. I was just gonna say, also for us, you know, there's a lot of red flags with founders these days who are thinking about their own trajectory more than they're thinking about the business. And as we all know, it's really hard to run a business. It's not glamorous. And you have to be really smart and really focused. And if you have a publicist already and you're looking to get invited to certain parties or get yourself on the cover of something because you want to be a known founder, that is a huge red flag to us. Because we live in a time right now where founders are more visible than they ever have been. And so a lot of founders get really distracted by that. And they're really like thinking about being whatever, quote, a founder is. And I don't know what being a quote founder is. It's just a person with an idea and a business that you have to run properly. So seeing that distraction, seeing like, you know, we live in a time right now where everyone's obsessed with profit. And profit can be the at the detriment of the quality of the thing that you're creating. So anyone who's focused more on that than they are with building something people need and want is a huge red flag. So final, final question. You've been in the fashion business for five years now. What is the like craziest or, or most surprising thing that you found operating? I mean, we're not even going to talk about tariffs and all that stuff. Please don't. But what is the thing that you're just like, I can't believe that it operates this way? Or I'm so shocked that we have to go through that process? I mean, it is crazy that you can't build, you can't make clothes in America that people can afford. You know, that's shitty. You know, we would love to make clothes in America that you that can have affordable prices. It's, it's shitty. But then on the flip side of that, I would say that in order to have a functioning global economy and global relations, certain countries just do certain things better. Like I would rather have my pasta from Italy. I don't want my pasta from America. I want it from Italy. I want my watches from Switzerland. You know, so I actually, we can talk about tariffs, even though I'm sure everyone's going to tell me, you know, say that we should not. But um, yeah, I probably should. So what's surprise do then, sir? You know, what's interesting? I've, this is just something that is, is very technical, but it's, it's about fabrics. I did not realize that you can take the exact same fabric and make it have a completely different feel and texture by how you treat it. That is something very technical, but it's something that is mind blowing to me. I mean, I've learned so much about fabrics in this process. Um, I'm obsessed with fabrics. I should probably do that full time for another business. I would probably do really well, but, but yeah, I mean, look, I'm going to be honest with you, we have been looking at other countries to do, you want to be diversified, right? You don't, and we are diversified. We've always been diversified. We've always done denim in Mexico and we're looking to doing t-shirts in Guatemala and we've been looking at Turkey for denim in Portugal for this, but you know, China does good suiting and China does great suiting as we know. And I think China's gotten a bad rap, but they are meticulous. They're artisans. They are really good at what they do. 100%. I mean, it's where nice clothes are made now. It is where nice. Yeah, this whole like made in China, like it's totally wrong. The optics are wrong. The narrative is wrong. And the whole thing has been a huge bummer to say the least. Okay. One, one more last question. I know I keep seeing that, but Aaron, you mentioned, or Sarah mentioned that Aaron, you're not on social media anymore. Like why? And also how is that affecting your flywheel? Because you all are like, my husband knows who you are because of social media. That's cute. Not because of barely famous, even though it was a brilliant show. We, you know, we're not watching that channel. So I think Sarah talks in extremes. Sometimes I am on social media, but I'm not very active in it on it anymore. And I think for me, you know, we were just talking about this yesterday. We had Tinks on our podcast and she's, she's really bright. And like for me personally, when I first got on social media, I was doing a sense of humor and bits that were unique to me. And now it just feels like it's what everybody does. Everybody's the same, you know? And it makes me feel like there's certain like dorky moms doing like funny bits that aren't really authentic to them that make me not really want to be a part of that group, you know? Like I just, my sense of humor feels like it's, I don't know, everyone has, everyone's like got a bit. Everyone's got a, like their angle, their stick, it feels very performative. And I honestly feel like it's kind of hard for me to remember how to be myself on social media now because A, when there's a lot of people watching and commenting on everything that you say and do, it makes you change how you behave inherently. And I really like to be open and honest. And I don't know, things get taken out of, taken out of context or it's just, it's kind of taken the fun out of it for me. I just say whatever the hell I want to say and I don't care. I mean, I don't want to say like, I'm so laissez-faire, like, oh, I don't care about it. Of course I care, but I just don't care. Yeah. Well, I think not caring what other people think is a big reason you all have been successful. I'm sure you care to an extent, but like, you can't care that much. I'll call someone, I'll be like, can you face tune my neck in that picture, please? Like my neck looks insane. I care. Like I care. I care about her neck than people's stances on her like political takes, you know? Yes. Yes. Yes. The neck thing is, it's tough. I didn't realize that was happening. Well, I sleep on my stomach. Do you understand? I sleep on my stomach and sleeping on your stomach if you are a vain person is, guys, for longevity, anti-ate, you do not want to sleep. Yeah. Doesn't Kim Kardashian sleep like a vampire, like on her back, without her head moving? You need to be doing that, Sarah. I know. You would think that I would because I care about that, but I just can't do it. I can't sleep if I'm not on my stomach. Yeah. No, but I mean, I think that we just, I think that growing up in the industry and in Los Angeles and in our circumstances that we're very used to people sort of having an assumption that they know who we are, how we live, what kind of people we are. And I think in our 20s, we were very defensive about it and felt like we had a lot to prove. And now in our 40s are kind of like, what are you going to do? All I can do is like, when I was making the TV show, I wasn't going around saying to my friends, I'm making a show. This is who's in it and this is what's going to happen with it. I knew if the show's a success, they will know. I don't need to tell them. And if it's a failure, I'll be glad I didn't mention it. But I also want to say that I have such respect for brands. You just like let that land. You know, you just let it land. So we had a moment, me, Lauren, we're having a moment. She looked at me like, wow, Erin. That was beautiful. And you just like jumped right in. Sorry. Okay. Well, it was beautiful. But I want to say about social media, like I don't want to leave this out, that I don't take lightly for one second that that is not a huge driving force in the success of our brand. You know, I don't want to be like, oh, we're not on social media. Like when I think about the Donna Carons of the world and the brands from the 80s and 90s that did as well as they did, and they had no social media, they had no click to buy swipe up, they just had to do it the old fashioned way. I'm in awe. Because when I see that something isn't selling well, I am the first person in my closet trying it on, showing it from all the angles, posting it. It is true. To generate. It's a big, big sell. I mean, literally this morning, Sarah texted our social chat and said, the Paloma dress is selling. And they were like, yeah, because you were posting it. Like it works. You know, it really does work. Yeah. So I just, I want to remind people listening that that is a huge part of why favorite daughter is successful. So yeah, I'm grateful for social media. I'm very grateful for it. We love Instagram. Yeah, we do. Thank you, Yvette Chen. So I thank you both. This was so fun. You're such pros. Everyone also listened to Sarah and Aaron's podcast because it's really professional. It's very unhinged. No, no, ours is very unprofessional. What are you talking about? Yeah, no. I can't wait. I'm going to look at the, oh, I'm looking at the Paloma dress right now. It's beautiful. By the way, are we getting knowledge that you and our dress the same? Yes, we have the same. So Aaron and I are both wearing, are you wearing gray T-shirt also? And a black V-neck sweater. It's a real uniform of a certain generation. Yeah, it really is. And Sarah has on a great favorite daughter sweatshirt. And sweatpants. Yeah, not cropped. Not cropped, oversized. Cute. Thank you both so much. You're awesome. Congrats on all of your success.
