Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Puck's Fashion and Beauty Memo Line Sheet. And today with me on the show is fashion journalist Max Berlinger. We're talking the Proenza guys at Loewe, the Nike Opportunity, and queuing up at Pompom. Happy Tuesday, everyone. Hope you had a great weekend. It's beautiful here in LA. It's not always beautiful, I swear, but it's really nice this week. And I am heading out tonight to attend a party at the Chateau Marmont for Kim Haystrider, her book Stuff. Kim curated a very good show in relation to the book at Jeffrey Deitch in New York. She's their very good close friends. And I was lucky enough to catch it on my last show. It was super fab. I hope she brings it out here. Maybe she is, and I just don't know who knows. Anyway, Kim seems to be out in about all week. So if you happen to be in town for a design space and all that stuff, please don't hesitate to also come down to the Pacific Design Center on Saturday, March 30th at 1 p.m. Or is it, no, it's March 29th at 1 p.m. Or I'll be taping an episode of Fashion People with Jesse Lee, the guy behind Design Space, which is an art and design fair where you can buy stuff, but also the guy behind Design Miami. If you've been to Art Basel, you've probably gone to Design Miami and also Basic Space, which is the e-commerce site that's connected to it all. Jesse's been on the PAW before, and this time we're going to drill down on this theory he has that has sort of become his tagline, which is design is the new luxury. It may sound like a little hokey, but it's true. The thing is, it's true. And so I love that he's like building a whole brand around it. So if you're interested in attending, hit me up on Lauren at pock.news and I'll put you in touch with the team or just visit DesignSpace.la to register. Jesse also has a lot of opinions about designers and which designer should design at which house. So if you're into designer musical chairs, we'll talk about that as well. Speaking of designer musical chairs, this week on Line Sheet, we are busy as usual. On Monday, I talk about the low-eve Proenza stuff that Max and I are going to get into as well. I guess I can't really say that anymore because Jack, Makala, Lazar, Hernandez no longer work at Proenza School or they are on the board, but they are solely the designers of low-eve. They start April 7th, so congrats to them. Again, Max and I get more into that. And on Monday on Line Sheet, I provided all the crucial updates for the future of sex global that I know. And as you probably know too, as of January 2025, sex global included Sex with Avenue, Neiman, Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman. So there's lots to talk about. Check that out. Today, Sarah Shapiro is back with all you ever needed to know about LL Bean, the greatest American brand or the biggest American missed opportunity. There is like tons of interesting stuff happening at that company that no one knows about. They're private, but also no one ever bothers asking and Sarah dug into it. And you'll be fascinated by the sort of corporate drama around the boat toe and the duck boot. It's an awesome story. You should check it out. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this time I have with Max. Max Berlinger, welcome to Fashion People. Thanks so much for having me, long-time listener, first-time caller. I'm shocked that you haven't been on before. I'm so glad to get you in the rotation. I'm happy to be here. I've been waiting, just twiddling my thumbs up. My God, I'm sure. You know how it is. I'm sure. How was your weekend? Did you go to the prom-tomp store opening? I did. I went on Thursday and it was fab and I was gonna go over the weekend to sort of see it because it was only sort of half-merchandised for the opening party. Interesting. What do you mean by that? A lot of the racks felt very sparse and the beauty section was basically empty and there was food and displays and stuff in that area. I wanted to sort of see it full customer-facing ready, but a friend of mine told me that there was lines to get in which bodes well. I was sort of like, I'll skip and go during the week sometime. Yeah, I also heard. I got a lot of thanks to all the readers who sent messages and not just Gen Z kids. Like it was like adults waiting in line this weekend. Oh, cool. Yeah. I mean, the store itself is very beautiful. They've done a really wonderful job with it, but I think that area has that rocky relationship with department stores. Yeah, it's interesting. The puck offices are a three-minute walk from One Wall Street. Prontomp is, for anyone listening who doesn't live in New York or LA or Paris or London, is a big department store in Paris on the right bank and is beautiful and one of these like old school Paris department stores. They used to be owned by the Pino family when they're the holding company that's now called Carrying was called PPR. Prontomp was one of the P's. I think it was Prontomp Pino Redu, for La Redoute, this weird catalog, not weird, but like a catalog with a stone. Sorry, I don't want to offend anyone. But then they sold it to, God, I don't remember, but then whoever owned it between the Pino's and someone else. And then in 2013, they sold it to like Katari and Amir situation, like the Katari royal family adjacent and they've owned it since 2013. And apparently someone messaged me and I'm not going to have time to fact check this, I don't think, but that Prontomp actually had a store in Denver in the 80s. Okay. Well, a friend of mine who lives in Paris now. Let's look it up. Interesting. I don't know if it's true. This, oh yeah. In Denver, Prontomp opens its first American branch store. Okay, how long did it last? Well, that's going to take too much research. But this is from the New York Times, 1987 by Diane Zalowski. Yeah, she's definitely from Denver. Really interesting, but they have been planning this Wall Street store for quite some time. And Jean-Marc, who's the CEO, then Laura, who's the US CEO, they've been like putting this together, I think since pre-pandemic, it was the plan. People were thrilled and it was like a lot of French people were there and it was very that and it was, the architecture was stunning because a lot of it is landmark. So the shoe room is like mosaics and it's just really soaring ceilings, but you couldn't touch any of the walls. So everything's sort of like these really cool sculptural stands for the shoes in the center of space and it's really cool. I would say the, my favorite part was they have like a real occasion wear sort of room that had a lot of vintage YSL, like really cool 70s vintage YSL that people were really freaking out about, but then they also had these mannequins higher up that had the most recent Gauthier couture collection. It just felt cool. You're like, yeah, everything's so casual nowadays. It was cool to see like a real salon for occasion wear. Yeah, that's amazing. I didn't, I went during New York Fashion Week and with a hard hat and saw everything and the shoe room is incredible. It's this mosaic tile from the 30s that and it was landmarked a few years ago. It's black and red and I was just blown away. And it was like a bank before? So it's like banks had like beautiful, you know, It has like a very 1980s bonfire, the Vanities five, which I love. And Laura Gonzalez who did the interiors, it is, everyone, if you haven't looked at the store, you need to go and just Google it because it is, it's wacko. Like it's wacko in the best way possible. It's just absolutely insane. But if that's interesting, because I didn't get to see it merchandise. I saw the sort of bare bones and the interiors were so incredible, like the changing rooms and everything. But I love this idea. The beauty space was really cool. Oh, nice. There's like a white beauty space and they have like little pods for massage, I don't know, facials and massages and yeah. Well, it's definitely, and I think the restaurant, the coffee shop and all that when you mentioned down there. So Saks used to be, is Saks still in Hudson Yards or? No, they closed. No, they closed. Did you go to that opening? I was talking about that. Yes, I did. I also, no, the name and Marcus was the one at Hudson Yards, right? Yes. I definitely went to that. Is the Saks down at, what's that? Wall World Trade or whatever. What's that? On the other side. Yeah. I mean, their corporate offices are down there. Saks, what's the San Ambrose is in that building too? Yeah, I don't know. Is that building? I don't know. It's like the AmEx is like above it, right? And there was like, it always looked like a Middle Eastern mall to me and it had that big food court that all the people go to. Oh, Brookfield. Brookfield, yes. Yes. Yeah, that San Ambrose is great. Like that's a big stop. I've gone there with people who work out of Brookfield. Is the Saks still in Brookfield? Saks? I don't think so. I think it closed. And then there was the Corsicoma also opened down there, but closed as well. Yeah. So it's hard. It's tough. Here's why I think the One Wall Street location is good for Prantamp. Look, here, let's caveat with opening a department store in 2025. Right. Yes. Which another, a second caveat is that Prantamp says it's not a department store. That's what all the marketing says. So it's not a department store. I mean, it's 55,000 square feet. It does feel, it's not comprehensive. It's like they have a beauty section. They have a really nice fine jewelry section. They have a lot of F&B food and beverage is the main driver. But I would say generally, like it's a challenge anywhere. Nordstrom opened in New York City in 2013. And that's been challenging too, even though it's in 57th Street in the middle of everything. So you have lots of foot traffic. And the Brookfield place of it all, that all was opened right before the pandemic. That's really challenging. And also it's on the west side by the water. So unless you live down there, it's not going to be a place you're going to want to go to on a regular basis. That said, so one Wall Street, the reason I think that it's interesting is A, it's not a comprehensive store. So like you're not going there to buy tights or whatever. That could be a detractor, maybe you are. But on the other hand, it's more of a destination because the interiors are so incredible. And so you have to go see it. It's kind of like Dover Street Market where you go there basically, I treat it like an art gallery in a way. I'm like, I just need to go to Dover Street in whatever city I'm in just to see what they have and see the art. Yeah. And so it feels like that. The other thing is there is a lot of tourist flow from all the like 9-11 stuff and then also from the Wall Street of it all. So you get that tourist flow. And then there are just like a ton of art galleries and office spaces and a lot of people who live down there because especially in the 2010s, that became a destination because it wasn't that expensive to rent a really nice apartment in financial districts. So I think that all combo, I know when I'm in the offices in New York, I go to Odeon like seven times a week. That was there for 10 days during Fashion Week and I went, I also stayed near there. But I just kept going there because it's like there isn't anywhere else to go eat. So I think in that way it's going to become, there's no boo, but it's probably going to become like an F and B destination for people who work from down there or live down there. Right. And there's that WSA building sort of nearby so that could like bring a whole little fashion crowd over from over there to like pop over for a coffee or whatnot. Yeah. Yes, exactly. How often are you in the WSA building? Often, like often or not. It's sort of, yeah, it's funny how it became the hot building, the cool building or whatever. But yeah, I mean, especially during Fashion Week, it feels like everything, but also furniture, like a lot of like design, you furniture fairs are doing stuff there. And I mean, you know, it's more often than not, you see like on an invite these days that they're having it. So will you, as just a consumer, go to the prom-tomp to like check it out once you've done your duty as a fashion journalist who covers the city of New York? What will you go down there? Do you think you and your partner, I don't, are you guys married? I don't know. No, we're just, we're just partners. You and your guy, are you guys going to go there on like a Saturday afternoon? Yes. Oh, yes. I think that's like part, I think, you know, like you, I know that you're a prolific shopper, I'll say, but I like to shop and that's part of the job. And that's like the fun part of the job is to keep checking in, keep seeing what people are buying, what people are putting out, how it's different than what other, you know, what Nordstrom's is doing, what, you know, there's a lot of cool small independent brands or stores in New York right now. And it's like, yeah, so what can this bring to the mix that a Venn space could not or a, yeah, Nordstrom uptown cannot? I agree. I had a friend of mine text me that they dropped several thousand dollars at Venn space and just had the best time ever. Baby, people are, I go often because it's a 10 minute walk from me. Nice. I go often and I go on weird times because I'm a freelancer like a Thursday at two. Yeah. There are guys and they are trying things on. They are buying things. It is, it's happening. Next time I'm in town, I gotta go. You haven't been? No, I feel really bad. I know Dan, my husband has been and was convinced to buy shoes there. Of course. Yes. The shoe selection is amazing. Those trees shoot those trees like really like sleek sneakers. It's like a million of them. And I feel like they just like fly off the shelves, but it's, yeah. I mean, he has a great selection of stuff, really cool, special stuff. And that part of Brownstone, Brooklyn, it's like creative, you know, all those like Williamsburg creative directors are now dads living down in this area. And they have $2,500 for their winter coat or like, you know, $1,200 for a shoe. What's the Cross Street? It's, so it's right off of Carroll Park. So it's, I think it's Carroll and it's like Carroll and Smith or Carroll and between, it's like, no, it's Carroll and it's leather and court. Yeah. And it's on a corner. So it's by the coffee shop. The coffee shop. And what's that place where they make the like griddle cakes that I forget? Yes. Whatever. I lived on third between Clinton Court for many years. I think that's where the owner, Chris is very like, he's like, I live around the corner. You know, his wife is, I believe the U.S. president of Totem. So they're like this little fashion power couple. So fun. Maybe they'll do a women's version. That would be cool. Well, so the, have you been to, I forget what it's called on Atlantic Outline? Outline. Yes. So Chris has said that, you know, Chris worked at Needs Supply and Totokayo. With one of those gals. Yeah. So she sort of has the, and the outline, have you been there? Yeah. I love outline. It's great. They are doing a really good job. Yeah. I understand it's complimentary. You're totally. It works. I've asked him, I said, yeah, is this going to be like a women's thing? And he's like, no, I think like men's is my thing. And like, Yeah. The women's is handled beautifully. Yeah. I think there's something about, I, CHCM I'm obsessed with. And in the same way that I shop at La Garcena a lot, but like there's something about CHCM that, and I feel like they're compliment, the two are sort of complimentary. And La Garcena also carries men's, but I think if you're, if, if you're in Manhattan, Louisa Villaroma right across from CHCM is actually awesome also. And I highly recommend. Do you like? They have really good, good stuff. Yeah. They have a very good buy. It's, I would have never gone in there, but I went because they had the Phoebe Fila stuff and they have a great buy for women. And they also have like a fancy dress room as well. But what I would say is I'd say the La Garcena sort of the complimentary one to CHCM. Interesting. And if you want to save in space and then outline, I think because I shop at the other two, they're not as exciting to me in some ways because I'm like, why can't it just be like this? Why can't I go in and it feel like this? But they probably are. And, and you know, maybe a guy would feel, feel the opposite. But you know what I think all, all of these lady stores at least are going to sell and maybe some of the men's is the new, new Loewe. Oh yeah. Probably. Calling all sourdough tamers, souffle whispers and jammy aches of vance.

So this morning after months, I reported in January that I was trying to find the original time you wrote about it and I was like, I can't even find it's like so deep. It was I think it was January 7th or January. Yeah, because it was right around not to be depressing, but it was right around the fires here. I wrote it the weekend that I was in Palm Springs escaping Los Angeles. Try, I was like, no, I'm fine. I'm fine. I can work. I have this great scoop. It's okay. It did distract me. Thank God for Disney Plus. But so yeah, I reported it on the Jack, Micola and Lazario Hernandez, the founders of Proenza Scholar were going to be the new creative directors. I believe it was January 13th that I ran it. Yeah. Yeah. Around there. Right. And of Loewe replacing Jonathan Anderson who's off to Dior, there have been setbacks in announcing it. Jack and Lazario were able to announce that they were leaving Proenza, which they are so going to be on the board, but they were, I don't know if they were allowed, but they decided to say that they were leaving the brand. But it was not possible for whatever reason someday. Maybe I'll figure out what happened behind the scenes. It was not possible for them to announce that they were going to Loewe, but last week, Jonathan Anderson finally was able to announce, I mean, maybe he didn't care. We were all like, just say it that he was leaving Loewe. I thought that the last collection that he and the studio worked on together, he did post the collection. So I am sure he had put on it. It was really beautiful that they showed him Paris a couple of weeks ago, but he was able to say that he was leaving. I had heard that they were going to wait two weeks to announce Jack and Lazario, but they only waited a week. And this morning, the news came out that Jack and Lazario are headed to Loewe, and they officially start April 7th, but look, we know that there's dusting going on behind the scenes. And also Men's Wear, which is exciting for me. Yes. It's like that. Women's men's and all accessories. Yeah. So it'd be cool for them. So what do you think about it as someone who's been writing about them forever and following their career and also following Loewe and the trajectory of that brand under Jonathan? Right. Well, I would say I'm excited to see an American duo go to Europe. It's been like, you know, it's a cool moment to have this very New York iconic New York brand go and have their designers go there. But I was just like looking through their last few collections this morning, just thinking, it's exciting. I will say it does feel a little Jonathan Anderson, Loewe-E, but everything is kind of like in that vein these days. But, you know, I'm just excited. I would say I'm an optimist and I always am like just, I try to sort of go into these partnerships open-minded and I can't wait to see the first collection and see where they land. I agree. I was thinking I need to be more antagonistic on these podcasts, but I can't. Look, I don't know because I feel like I'm and I push back a lot in my writing, but when on the podcast, I'm like, yeah, I agree with you. But I do agree. I think, look, here are the things. One is that, well, no, I'm not gonna, because I am fully rooting for them for the same reasons you just said. And also a couple of things. One is that Loewe is on an upward trajectory. It's one of two brands maybe at LVMH right now that is feeling good. Laura Piana is like killing it. Loewe still has good traction. The bags, like the fact that they have been able to create bags and there aren't really, it bags anymore, but the bags in the market that look different and that are really hard to knock off is tremendously, it's incredible. So it's on an upward trajectory. Pascal is the CEO, has an amazing reputation. She's a really good merchant. And Jonathan Anderson could have stayed there for another 10 years and it would have kept working and it was in T Magazine, he said something about it being about a $2 billion business. You know, it could get to $5 billion. It could have gotten to $5 billion with him. So the fact that he decided to leave because he is an ambitious person who wants to challenge himself in a million different ways, I get why they don't want to scrap it. Because some of these brands you need to scrap it. Givenchy, you need to scrap it. There are things that like just feel so stayed or just never really worked and you need to just start from day one and use the infrastructure to build it up fast. This, you don't need to do that. And I think what Jack and Lazaro represent and I have written so many big articles about them, about their business troubles, about their potential as designers, about all of this stuff. When they started out, they were, first of all, their work felt really original and felt like nothing else. Julie Gilhart famously bought it, their collection for Barney's. Anna was a huge champion. Anna helped make them. Like sexy and cool. Like they were like cool dudes. Yeah, but the challenge was that they really were, a lot of pressure was put on them really fast. They've raised up a ton of money like four years into the business. Like it was just insane. They were already being put like considered to the successes for Valentino and they were like 25 years old. It's just so crazy and they represented so much and there was the weight of the American fashion industry sat on these two guys' shoulders. And look, they were very successful. They had a lot of, they got a lot in return, but I would say creatively, it stalled them because there's, and you all can Google this stuff, they have the PS1, this it bag, which I think is destined for a comeback now, but it sort of took over their business. It allowed them to raise even more money. The money wasn't the right kind of money. And they just, they were really challenged financially and they never got to kind of let their creative minds. The whole thing is that they are legit, they are legit, they are legit, but they weren't given a chance to really be legit because of the fact that they had all this, they were small business owners. And so, look, like working at a company, a $2 billion in sales business is a lot. With an infrastructure in place, like a big marketing team, a big business minds there. In some ways, it's more pressure and it's harder. You have a bigger team to manage and all that stuff. But in other ways, it's going to be not easier, but just a different kind of challenge and work their brains in a different way. And so, I'm really happy for them. And also, I don't know, they just have, I feel, I don't know. It's just you. They've been around, you've mentioned this a few times that we're the same age. And it's like, they mean a lot to me, a person of my age, 42 years old, they sort of were, had this explosive growth trajectory when I was first getting into fashion, getting my feet wet, and we've seen them grow. And now it's cool to see these guys who are these Wunderkidns get this mid, I don't want to call them middle age, sorry to say this, but they're in this different phase of their lives. And then to have this new sort of platform to be able to express their creativity is a really exciting and hopefully a really great moment for them. They rise to the occasion. I think they can. Yes. Yes. And I would also say, oh, and the point that I was trying to make at the beginning, was that this shouldn't be, like Francesca Bellantini used to say this about Salaran. I think it's a good one. It's an evolution, not a revolution. So when Anthony Vacarella took over for Hetty, it wasn't like, we're going to totally change it because it was working. And it's the same thing with, so I think this is a huge opportunity for them. It's a great challenge. Let's do it. I have maybe mentioned this on the pod before, but it's also interesting that American guys taking over Loewe, Michael Ryder at Celine, pretty much, there are pretty much no creative directors at LVMH now, other than Guillaume Henry, who does Petu and Nicolette Guescaire, who does or Guescaire, depending on who you are, who does Louis Vuitton, there pretty much aren't any other French creative directors. So it's interesting, like there's lots of Americans, Brits, Irish. So it's just funny and it just reflects the world. So I'm really happy for them and onward. I would say, yeah, so now we have one more announcement in that fold. And then also, prior to jumping on, we were talking about, there really aren't as many, there's not like a lot of stuff dangling right now about creative directors. Although who would you say is going to go to Proenza now? Oh, yeah, that's a good point. It's an interesting size business. You know what I mean? It's sort of interesting. I am very pro and I have no idea. I said this when it first, when they was first announced, I think they should hire Sandra Lac, who used to, who did Seize Marjane and who used to make trees and is hugely, hugely talented. And I think he is strong enough of a designer that he could do his own thing, but like could still feel like Proenza. Oh, I love that. Because the thing about Proenza is it sells really well. It's a brand that, the price point, it's designer, but it's not that expensive. It's one of those things where if you're, if you want to look cool or you just want to look good and you don't want to have to think too hard, a lot of women who like fashion, but aren't into fashion by Proenza at this point, it's like a big seller at a lot of boutiques. And so I think Seize Marjane had that, he has that commercial sensibility that you need for that brand, but also people would want to go to the shows. Another person that's name who, she should probably kill me for saying this, but I think there are a lot of people who think Maria McManus would be good for it too, which I agree. But I think she'd have to figure out should she keep her own line going if she was going to do that. Because it's just, it's, they have a very similar customer. Because I was thinking like Daniela, that Daniela Kalmeyer girl, sort of like, does tailoring really well? And I know like tailoring is sort of, you know, dresses and tailoring, I would say are Proenza in my mind, like other big things. But also what happened, Patrick Orville was hired to launch menswear and then like that. And then I was kind of like, just let Patrick do it. I would love Patrick to just do it. I'm obsessed. Remember when all the girls would wear just, I think like Kirsten Dunst would wear his suits and stuff. So I was like, just let him do it. I agree. I also think, and I don't want to, I need to be careful, I say this, but I think menswear designers, not male designers, but menswear designers, when they move into women's, I think it tends to work much better than when women's wear designers move into men's. Totally. I agree. And it's not about whether the person is male or female. It's more about like, if you start in men's, I think it's easier to go into women's and have an idea. And I've always been such a big fan of Patrick's stuff. I think that would be great too. And so I'm on the subway platform recently and he looked very chic and cool. He's so cool. He's such a cool guy. That whole crew is very cool. And I think also, they have a really great CEO. She, unfortunately, had just started when this all went down. So Kashiara, she's kind of stuck, not stuck, but like it is a situation that maybe she wasn't prepared for. I don't know. Maybe she knew before that they were talking and that this might happen. But she is a good CEO and should be able to keep it. Look, they have investors, they want to sell it. I think they'll be able to sell it. It's a good brand. And we'll see. But it's exciting all around. I think like, so now all we're really doing is your announcement. But is Balenciaga? Who would you want to go to Balenciaga? Which I don't think we're going to know that for months. Really? No, because also, but also is Fendi's up in here, right? Oh yeah. Yeah. But what? You don't care about Fendi's? But here's the thing. Until they phase the family out entirely, who, like I said, I think Sylvia Venturini, Fendi did an amazing job. Totally. With that last show. And maybe they should just keep her for a few years. But it's never going to fully become an exciting thing unless the family is phased out. Like it's a 100 year old business. It's time. It's time for like a new big idea. Yeah. It's a time for a new big idea. And so I think that LVMH knows who they want to be there. Whether or not that person's going to do it, we'll see in the next coming weeks. But yes. You know who LVMH wants to be there for. I think that they would be happy with Pierre Palo, but I think they'd be really happy with Maria Grazia. And so let's see. Both of those are possibilities. The issue is I don't know what the deal is with Sylvia. Fendi doesn't own any of the business as far as I know from the recording I've done. So like they're keeping her for another, I don't know. Maybe just tradition or whatever and the business does okay or whatever. Totally. But I think they should, whoever they give it to, they should just give them the whole thing. And just remake it because it's a very cool brand that could deal a lot. For you, who would you like to see there and who would you like to see at Palenciaga? I mean, Pierre Palo was sort of my Fendi pick just because he's Roman and I think there's like that sort of brand equity there. And I also think people loved his Valentino. People went crazy for it. So I don't know, did it sell well? Do you know? Well, here's the thing. Valentino, yeah, it sold like couture sold well. The clothing sold. Yes. But the issue was, oh, A, I think it was just time for a change and B, I think that the accessories when he and Maria Grazia were together, were really successful because she's an accessories designer. He's ready to wear the two of them together. It was like really magical, that Valentino. I remember interviewing them. They were so happy. That I interviewed her at Dior. She was this happy. Hard, I mean, I think those big brands are hard. It's so hard. It's a hard job. I mean, anyone who does them, you got to give them a ton of credit. But I think I'd be interested. You could also see Fendi just like a totally, it has like a wacky thing about it too. And I kind of wish it was someone who was like young and wacky and they would put like a little cookie. Yeah, because the bag sell. Were you saying Maria Grazia and Pierpolo together again at Fendi? No, but that's a great idea. But that could be, I mean, they could potentially be. Yeah, I'm sure that would be like really, really unfinancially viable. That's like half of Fendi sales. No, I'm just kidding. But like they both are very expensive. And that is the one thing with these different, you do have to weigh that it. Like with a lot of these younger designers, you can pay them less and then you pay them more. Like Alessandro got paid a ton at the end, but at the beginning it was getting paid like nothing. And so you get paid a little bit at the beginning and sales do really well. Whereas when you have someone who is really well known, like that's expensive. And that is that's a risk you need to take. So I don't know if they would want it, but that would be really fun because they were magic together. They were magic. Is there any interesting hearing you saying that they seem very happy together, which seems lovely. Yeah, yeah, they seem like they were having a good time at that. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, they were. Yeah. . The process of accepting insurance outside of a group practice can be tough. But most people looking for mental health care want to use their benefits to pay for sessions.

For Blensy Aga, I mean, I feel like you said everyone, but, you know, first of all, I have a love for Mark Jacobs and I want to say. Oh, yeah. I think he does. I would make fun. His shows for his own brand are amazing, incredible. He does so much with not a ton. I don't know what the like brand, you know, I don't know how it sells. I don't know how the brand does financially, but I feel like a bigger stage for Mark is always going to be good for everyone in the fashion world. He's a true fashion historian. He's a true appreciator of fashion. He steals and says it. He like, you know, he appropriates. He he's just a smart guy and I just could see him there. I could see Daniel Roseberry there very easily. I think that like, I think of Blensy Aga, I think of like sort of sculptural silhouettes shapes. You know what I mean? And I'm like, I want someone who can give me a real bold shape and I know that Daniel can do that. That's so true. I think those are two really good ideas that I hadn't totally thought of, but I do. They both have couture. Yeah, I don't know if Mark has ever actually done couture, but he can't do it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I love both of those ideas. Those are those are new, new names, which is exciting. If either of them make it to the end, I hope I get a little kickback. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm always like, where's my commission? Right, exactly. I think those are two exciting. That is such an amazing that is the if I was a designer, that's the house I would want. Totally. And it's been so many different things. You know, I was just looking back at Nicola's stuff the other day just for fun. And it's just it's crazy what that brand it's because he was such a genius. It can be so many different things. And like, I mean, Demna's obviously a completely different take. I know you love them or like a real lover. And you know, I don't like it as much, but I still think he created a cultural moment that like sort of defined where we are right now. Yeah, I think it's funny. I asked, I bought a pair of Balenciaga shoes that my friend Delfine had bought and she posted them. And I got them and they were far too pointy for me. So they're dressy. They're dressy. They're made of neoprene, but they're like a pointed mule with a little bow on top. And when Delfine posted them, I was like, oh, these are pretty, she's very, I don't want to say conservative, but very traditional, very preppy, French preppy. And I was like, oh, I'll buy these. And I got them on set tire for like way cheaper. Unfortunately, I got them and I was like, oh, they're too pointy for me. And so I tried to send them back and set tire said I had worn them because it's a huge, it's so scammy. And so I tried like, I did everything. I was like, tried threatening them and then nothing worked. So I even wrote about it. Nothing happened. So I kept them and I wore them the other day and I was like, actually, these are really good. Even though they were super, because they have that demna thing of they're just like a classic shoe, but they're like a little like, make you a little uncomfortable. Like the point makes you a little uncomfortable. And I wore them the other day with vintage Gucci, speaking of demna vintage Gucci, pinstripe, like crop trousers and a, and a black V-neck sweater. And it was just like a really, I wore them to lunch in Beverly Hills and they looked great. Love. Two things you live in LA, you these uncomfortable shoes you drive and then you toss them on for your lunch in Beverly Hills. No, I just wear them. You don't have to, you don't, okay. See, you don't have to clump around though. It's like, that's perfect for you. And secondly, I just love hearing about your crazy shopping. I feel like you're a crazy shopper like me, like searching for things you find the thing. You're like, how can I get it? And you're like, oh, I don't like it. I'll return it. It just your, your madcap adventures in shopping are very funny to me. Thank you. I try. Do you have the spring shoppies? I have the, I was like, it's been like going around. I shopped in Paris. Oh, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. I can't. You got like a Phoebe Filo. So we are not cheap. I'm done for like the next six months. Mama's seasonal budget is done. Yes, it really is. Like I'm just, I have, I have a child. I have tuition. I have a mortgage. Like a lot of stuff that's like, I am now, I'm like, what can I sell on the real, real? So that when I go to Tokyo and yeah, I'm lucky that our vacations in Tokyo, where I never want to buy anything weirdly. Cause like it's just all, it's, I bought some arts and science stuff, but like I'm always thinking, yeah, so it's fine, but I do want, I do need, you know, I know more for me. Have you bought anything good? Not really. You know, I'm a sample sale shopper like you and then like a real vintage person and I'm sort of very casual. I'm from California. So I'm like that casual like jeans or like, I'm real, you know, very like a car harder dickies, like to be totally honest. Yeah. It's crazy when I'm here because I have a bunch of events this week and I'm like, I really need to wear my New York clothes because I buy all these, all the clothes I buy are not appropriate for here. I literally every single day wear vintage jeans and a vintage sweatshirt and that's it. Or, or when I go to the office, okay. No, I have you work from home. I work from home and then I work from no house a few days a week and I do have, I have some friends who work there. So I do like have a reason to dress up a little bit, but it's really hard for me. Whereas in New York and Paris, I mean, how do you think they wear really weird stuff? It's all weird. Like people in LA dress weird. Not everyone. It's so, it's so individualized here. Like you don't know you go to one place that you go to another. I just did a, I just did a call with someone, did a podcast with someone from LA who, who I'm, it's escaping me and they were like, I love Los Angeles style and I was like, really? And I agreed with them, which is my issue with the, but You have to push back. But yeah, I mean, people wear like, it's very weird clothes. Right. Well, it's a lot of athleisure. There's like pockets of like that athleisure, like sort of like the pulled back Kardashian look. And then there's sort of like East Side kids. Yes. The East Side, there's some good stuff. Like, Yeah. You go to Baro Santo is my, my number one pick for if you want to see people with good style. But, but generally it's a, it's a Spanish restaurant that is owned by the people who own Found Oyster in Queen Street. Oh, it's good. It's really good. But they like everyone there always looks awesome. And it's, it's old enough that I don't feel too young. There's this other one called Bar. I want to say siesta or something on, on Sunset in Silver Lake. And I went with two friends at like 9pm on a Friday night. I was like, wow, I am too old to be here. I need to like check please. Yeah. It was too much. But anyway, there was one more thing. Speaking of athleisure that I wanted to cover with you, which was the Nike results for last week and Sarash Piro at Puck covered them for us and kind of talked about, you know, Elliot Hill has been there since October. He's still making some big changes. The chief comms officer exited, the chief strategy officer exited. I assume they'll replace the comms officer, but I don't know if they're going to replace this strategy officer. It sounded like it might just be like a restructuring thing. And then, you know, it's just, it's tough out there. And I was curious as someone you, I, I presume you do wear Nike also. And you follow the brand. You are from the world of athleisure. La, la, land of athleisure. What do you think? Well, I think it's only where Vans slip on, which that Valentino. Are you going to get them? I don't think so. I mean, there was one pair that I didn't see in the like all the news items that had like little cat faces on them that I were like, that's actually really fun and cute. But I don't know how much they're going to be. I feel like I just like a checkerboard. But what I'll say is I like to work out and I go to berries. Yeah. That berries everyone wears on or polka. Period. Yes. And I did see a girl recently wearing and I had to like chase her after class. She was wearing a cool pair of Nikes and they're called the V2K run. And they're like sort of new and they look like sort of new balancey, asexy, like dad Chewy. Yeah. And I did notice that I think Mary Kate. I was just going to say that. Are these the ones that one of the Olsons are wearing? Yes. Yes. Yes. So I was kind of like, I just got to report that Jen Brill wears them. Oh, interesting. Someone because someone I like posted the MK or was it, it was a who wore them. Ashley. I posted the Ashley thing and someone reported back. Jen Brill wears those. Who's obviously very cool. Yeah. And not to self promote, but I did write something for the time recently about how the times I recently wrote something about how like sneakers are getting sort of slimmer and yes, lower profile. And I spoke to Brendan Dunn at Complex who has a sneakers and he was like brands like Nike are well positioned right now for this moment because Anodidas, because they have these like sort of deep catalogs of like slimmer profiles and they're bringing them back. They have like sort of a brand engagement with that, that authentic factor. Yeah. And on and Hoka are just big chunky sort of and they just don't have that profile and that's not what they're known for. Yeah. So yeah. It was like, I could see this being a good moment for them to capitalize on all that. I agree. Couple of things. One is that I bought the first of the Nike Internationalist sneaker. I think that's what it's called. They really need to go hard on it because I just think it's like Emily Gould for some reason. They don't really do it much. I don't even know if they sell it at all, but Emily Gould for some reason years ago, we were talking on Twitter when we, I don't know if she's still on Twitter. I'm really not on it anymore about it. And I said, or she said that it's the platonic ideal like a mom sneaker. Like it is, and you could still buy it in a custom, but the one, if you Google it, Nike Internationalist and you look at the buy you and the first one that comes up, which is like a white with gray and cream accents, it is like a sneaker that it's not going to offend anyone. It's not going to make anyone think anything about you. It's not going to make anyone, they might look at it and think it looks nice, but they're not going to think you think you're cool. They're not going to think you think you're, it's not like wearing they, Vajas or whatever, like no offense, but like, you know, it's just, there's a feeling. If these, these are the shoe that if you need something for school drop off, these are what you should wear. I think they work for men as well. There is a, I got a Stussy Nike collab, which I don't wear a lot because it's made of that like waffle netting. And I just, it's like too fashion for me. Cause I'm not Stussy Nike low. And it, Yeah, when was it from? Oh, it was from their last collaboration. And I, oh, it's the LD 1000. It's, and I got it in the cream with blue. And I got them, they were Chris Black approved. Like anytime I'm trying to buy something that's like a cool thing, I asked Chris just to make sure it's like not inappropriate for me to buy it. And he was like, yes, you should buy them. I would say that like, I don't wear them a lot because I did the waffle, the waffle of it. But they are good and they're, they're that like slim, what you're talking about. They're slim. They're not super slim, but they're slim. And these are the kinds of things this LD, it's LD 1000. I mean, Nike should be selling because it's sort of like the Cortez, but a little bit slimmer. Okay. It looks like they are trying to sell. Oh, oh yeah. See, they have it in like all black. This is a sneaker that they need to be like really, really going hard on. And I think you're right. The on and one final thing on on, which I'm still very bullish on, Hoka less bullish on as like a long-term thing on, I'm very bullish on. I bought a pair of on sneakers to try them and not only just for running. And I just went back to Brooks. It's not for me. Like it just wasn't the way it looks. And also I didn't like the way they felt when I was running. I love you guys. Don't at me. Don't try to send me a pair. I, it's fine, but it just wasn't for me. So it's interesting. I do think like I just went back to Brooks for running. I don't care what they look like. And they know the interesting thing, all those like dorky brands are now selling. They sell Brooks does all white now. Cause it, cause they used to have like all these ugly colors. You don't want them. They just went all black or all white. But yeah. So when people are running, I think, you know, it's like spring here in New York, but it's like all these run clubs. I mean, look, Nike's a huge business. It sounds like it wasn't a great quarter, but I think Sarah was reporting that it's going to take time and people understand that this is not going to be an overnight thing. I think everything in fashion these days is such a quarter by quarter thing. And it's like, guys, we got to let things take their time. It's not going to be overnight. You know, I think about all these crazy designers who are there for two years or whatever and out. It's a big business like Nike is just going to take time to turn around and you have to like trust the process. But I was reading, I think a Bloomberg thing where all the analysts were like, we're fine. Like we know that they, it was not a great quarter, but it is what it is. Like you got to like clear house. But look, can't read, believe everything analysts say. Let me just say that. But I, in this case, I agree. I, this is a huge, this is a $50 billion business. It's like market cap of over, I think like $130 billion or something. This is, and look, we all still like Nike. If we didn't like it, that would be a problem. But we all still like it. And maybe young kids have issues with it, but no one like this internationalist sneaker for the, for the kids run, it's inoffensive. It's also nice. It's like people feel good. They're a good vibe towards Nike. I think that this, this campaign they did about you can't win or whatever, doesn't make any sense. And it's too cerebral and bad idea. But generally I'm very pro and excited to see what Elliot Hill does. Yeah. Max, it was so great to catch up with you. And so good to catch up with you. When are you back in town? Can we catch up in person? Yes. Yeah. I'm back for like two days at the beginning of April, but I'll be there longer for in early May. Who is it? So we'll, we'll hang. I'm sure around MacGow. I would love that. Plenty. Oh, that's right. Because I was like, oh yeah. Yeah. It'll be fun. Thank you for being here. I appreciate you. Thank you so much for asking.
