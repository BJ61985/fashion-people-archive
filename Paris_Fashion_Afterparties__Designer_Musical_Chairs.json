And today with me on the show is Chris Black, podcaster, extraordinaire writer and marketer. We're talking Vogue World, the men's shows, couture, what it means to be a brat. And of course, the rumor of the week. Let's get started. Hey everyone, I am still in Paris. I tried to get Botox from a very chic French dermatologist on Friday and she actually rejected me. She told me I didn't need Botox. I should do something else, but we don't have to do it for a couple of years. She gave me a prescription for like a cream or something, sent me on my way. I'm going back there to deal with some like sun damage stuff in September. It's great. I now have my dermatologist is now in France. It's truly the chicest thing that I've ever done and will continue to do and also the most affordable, very, very good health system here. I'm definitely going to see her again. Should I move to Paris? Probably not. I really love LA. I actually leave from Alon tomorrow as mentioned. I've mostly been sitting out the shows, but I did manage to hit up quite the triumvirate this weekend. I went to the ASAP Rocky show on Friday, the Dries Van Nones show on Saturday, and then Vote World on Sunday. I also like in between, I popped into Sakai actually took my kid to Sakai. It was his first fashion show ever. So thanks to everyone at Sakai for making that happen. It was really lovely. And on Monday night, I went to the Tom Brown tour show. I'm going to go to Armani tonight. So, you know, I would love to be at everything, but you can't be at everything and meetings have been really fruitful and important. So, you know, I did enough. You'll find coverage on all this stuff though in Line Sheet, my private email from Puck, or on Monday, I really went into the Howl's and Wives of Vote World. And Chris and I also talk about it. My overall take is that Vote World is good. That is what I think. And I explain why in Line Sheet. You have to subscribe. I also documented the latest luxury HR moves. I have a little fun scoop on a new collaboration. And of course, there's plenty more this week's issues are going to be packed. There's just so much going on, but please don't hesitate to send me more tips. I am available always for those. So let's get going with Chris. Chris Black, welcome to Fashion People. Thank you for having me. I love podcasting with a fellow professional. You better make this good. Okay. The pressure is on. Understood. Understood. I was with Jacob Gallagher at Vote World last night and I said, it's really annoying. He wouldn't do it because he's technically on vacation. I mean, luckily I was here to pinch hit, but people take vacation a little more seriously than I would like them to across the board. Give me a break. I think it was honestly, I think he travels a lot and he probably doesn't take enough. And I think this was a situation where he had to, but I was like, we went to this event. And we can't talk about it. Well, I've seen a lot of people comment on Vogue World and I just don't understand what the issue is. Of course it's to make money from advertisers and to put on a spectacle. Why is that bad? I don't understand what the negative is. 100%. Did you watch the live stream? No, no, no. I mean, I don't care that much, but I just think I saw people like kind of being like, what is it? Okay, I'll bite. What is Vogue World even mean? And it's like, dude, it doesn't matter what you think it is or think it's not. It clearly makes money. Look, it made the money. It was profitable. The celebrities came. They didn't really. Oh, they didn't. It was a low, the biggest celebrity that I talked to was, I talked to John Mulaney. I went up to him. Yeah. He was very gracious, but I was like, I'm sorry, I never, you know, I never do stuff like that, but I was like, I love your show. Also you just advertised in my column in Puck and he was like, oh, I love Puck, but I said your stylus is great as well. And then I was like, I need to stop. This is too much. No, I think that's okay. I think that I'm sure he'd like to be recognized in that setting because it's new to him. To some extent. Sure. And he was brought by Hermes, which had a big presence at the event. Axel Dumas, the CEO and like, I don't know, 50th generation heir of Hermes or whatever. He was there and they had a big presence at the show and everything. So look, I am very into this. John Mulaney is now a fashion guy. Did you watch that show? Yeah, I watched the show. I liked it. You feel like it was like taking a lot of what you and Jason do and... No, not even. No, Mulaney's a legend. He's one of the greats. Like I really love... It was so good. I mean, his cocaine stories and his special were some of the best I've ever heard. Going to get a haircut at Saturday Night Live is one of the greatest stories I've ever heard, but I just didn't... I think it's cool that that show was on TV, if that makes sense. Like I think it's a good sign for the world that that got distributed by Netflix. And that's what I care about. I agree. I agree. I feel like also you are now, because you're a famous podcaster, friends with some celebrities, you do a lot of this. Like aren't you tomorrow hosting some red carpet thing for the bear? Yeah, the bear premiere is tomorrow night in LA and Jason and I are... I'm in Toronto and Jason's in London and we're rendezvousing in LA on a day off from tour to do it. Yeah. What are you wearing? A stylusone. I didn't have time. Honestly, I would normally wear J.Crew, but I just did not have time to get it together. Some wearing a classic vintage Levi's denim tuxedo and a blazer from the row with some ostrich cowboy boots. I like that. Okay, good. I actually... I'm surprised you're not wearing Tom Brown, but I guess that's too much for the bear red carpet hosting. No. I mean, Tom Brown... I mean, Chris, the creator of the bear obviously loves Tom Brown and it's like a... I.O.'s chef's jacket is a character in the show at this point, but I just don't... I feel like when you're doing the interviews, you want to look a little more understated because it's not about you. Got it. I just came back from the Tom Brown couture show. I love the color palette. I watched it. I streamed it live. I was talking to the person I was sitting next to, Derek Blazburg. I was saying to him that I wonder who the private client customer is there. And then across from us was Oprah's trainer. Who knew who Oprah's trainer... Derek knew that. Okay. Derek knew that. I was hoping you would say that because I would be surprised. Of course. I knew that that guy was... I knew he was famous. I knew it was a famous person, but I couldn't tell you who... Famous could be an Oprah statement. You know who this person is. He's very... Trainers are the stars. Yeah, I forget his name. We could look it up. But why bother? But he looked great. He was in head to toe Tom Brown. And I wonder if he is a person who would buy one of these. There was a beaded jacket that was... I was like, I wonder if that's a $40,000 thing or $100,000. Probably $100 at this point. This stuff is getting intense. It is. Yeah. I mean, it's just... The labor involved is so crazy that the prices are half to match. Did you watch the Vogue livestream, the Vogue World livestream at all? Did you all watch it? No. It's basically a music video from what I remember. And as much as I love the heyday of MTV, I didn't feel like the urge to watch it. If it would have been... I don't know what the time zone thing was. If it would have been... I watched New York because it was easy. New York was fabulous. It was so amazing. It was the best fashion show of that entire week. It was so great. It was such a great advertisement for all the brands that went. It was a great advertisement for Vogue. I didn't go to London and honestly, I did do some reporting on it, but I did not watch the livestream. I was there last night. Jacob and I were seated next to each other behind the Arnault Kids. So thank you to whoever put me there. It was a great, great position. And also Jean-Paul Gaultier, who was extremely late, but who knows why. I mean, glad to have him. It was an amazing seat. We were just happy to have him. We were happy. But the thing I will say is, I got a ton of feedback afterwards. It was a little bit odd, but because that kind of stuff is, it's very theatrical. It's very... Yeah, it's like if Broadway made a music video, that's going to be a little bit. That's how it's going to feel. But fashion shows often feel like that anyway. Exactly. And I will say, are there things I would have done differently? Sure. I could go through the list. But one thing I think is that I wish the styling was a little more cohesive and it's really hard. There's that Margiela collection, three looks from that, and then Hermes looks. It's just hard to make that feel like a bigger idea. But the thing I will say is, it was just an incredible feat to get them to open the Plasphandome or close off the Plasphandome. No other brand. I can't. I haven't fact checked this yet, but what I was told today is that literally no brand has ever been able to do that and they've tried. I completely believe that. I think that the strings were getting pulled from the highest level. 100%. And it's a testament to Anna Wintour and her team who is really efficient and works very hard. But no one else could have done that. And that is why you still advertise in Vogue. Whether or not you advertise in the same way you used to, you see that whole display and what they put together and just the fact that they had it there. If they had just had people hanging out there with nothing, it would have been worth it. No, it's still a feat. I agree. I think that that's why these kind of events and fashion shows in general, they're becoming such a competition one Upsman chip. You can fly 200 people to Marrakesh. It's a competition and this is for the reasons you laid out. It's like this is a real victory. Did you watch or look at any of the men's shows? Yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah. I looked. Yeah, I did. I mean, I don't- How closely do you look at the shows? I mean, I look at the ones that I know I'm going to like. I'm not going to look at Kid Super, but I'll look at Aura Lee and I'll look at La Mer and stuff. I mean, Aura Lee is so cool and so good and I'm ready for someone to like write the story about it kind of. I feel like it's been bubbling for three, four years and no one knows anything about it, which is so rare these days, which is very compelling, I think. But yeah, I mean, I watch. I look at the photos. I mean, I think it's like a lot of stuff is just beyond my level of comprehension. I just don't understand. I just don't understand. Like comb that kind of thing? Yeah, yeah. Like I appreciate the artistry, but like I can't look at that and like click through it and have it speak to me. It's just not how I operate. Yeah, I understand that. I never went to any like, you know, at women's there's a Japanese day, but it's like comb, it's junior, it's isy. There's just like five and a lot of them are part of that, that comb family owned business and Dover Street and all that stuff. And I never used to go because all the places I worked at either were not kind of advanced enough to cover that kind of thing. And when a B of F like I wasn't going to be the one reviewing those shows. So I just like didn't make an effort. And this past fashion week, I was like, you know what, I might as well just go and see. And there are a few of those, those comb shows that I feel like are probably very emotional and we miss them. Like that's That era is over. Yes. And then the other part is it is not easy for me to write about that type of thing. Like I need something literal. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm saying I looked at, you know, Oralee and Dries and the road, whatever stuff that I'm like, Oh, I could actually wear this if I want to wear it. And I know that's not what it's about, but it kind of is what it's about. 100%. And especially men's and Oralee is very interesting. That stylist Charlotte Colette. Yeah. Her name is she also does ballet. She's so good. And also I love it. They sell it at Lagar Son in the U.S. for women and I'm sure a bunch of men's stores, but some guy that you honestly can't remember who it was. It wasn't you, but someone was saying it's the only Japanese brand that fits like taller guys. Yeah. It fits like pretty normally, like from my limited experience. But yeah, you can get it at, you can get it at CHCM in New York, I know. But yeah, it's tough to see a lot. I mean, Nitty Gritty in Stockholm has it. That's where I've seen like a lot of it, but it's not everywhere for sure. I agree. I think that Jacob sort of led with it in his men's roundup on Wall Street Journal. But it was the show that people were talking about and La Mer because La Mer always looks great and I thought this collection was really good. And I went to the store and everything looked really good. And I bought a couple of things I hadn't bought anything in a couple of years, but Dries was obviously the show. So is it true that no one could spot Margella? Is that really, is that true? Is it really true? So I asked the PR if Margella was there. First of all, who would know what he looks like? There's so many nerds on like fashion Reddit and fashion Twitter. No way. Somebody knows. Somebody knows. The problem is like there is one photo of him on the internet. I know the photo. I know the photo. Maybe they could have like, like computer generated a photo of him of what he might look like today. Like that is updated. Yeah, you're right. You're right. You're right. I went backstage right after the show to the what they call backstage of the scrum, like the group of people. And I never, I am like not equipped for that. I was at the ASAP Rocky show with Jacob and him and his little friend who works at, where does that guy work that these like best friends? He works at a French newspaper. I had a very nice seat. He is adorable. He came out. He smiled at everyone and Rihanna looked beautiful. Alex Arnaud was there. They were hanging out. The Carl Lagerfeld's house is gorgeous. So who paid for this? Puma. Puma paid for this. He had some deal. I knew he had a Puma deal. So Puma paid for this. And are these clothes going to be for sale eventually? Or is this more of an art project? I didn't honestly. The clothes were atrocious and it doesn't. The one look I liked was someone was carrying like a laundry bag full of like quote unquote dirty clothes. I thought it was good. Very Balenciaga. I don't, I think that he's such an interesting case because he's not a rapper anymore. He's not a fashion designer. He's Rihanna's husband and an influencer basically, you know, which is a very profitable career when you're at the level he is. But it feels like this was like a real stretch. Like he was searching for something. At that show, Jacob and, is it Matt too from LeMond? Is that that guy's name? They were like little rats. They like snuck back there. And I was like, I'm not doing this. And then at Dries, same thing. Like they all hightailed it back. And by the time I got there, I couldn't hear anything. He said, I was like, well, I missed out again, but I knew he was staying and he was going to come out. Like a big disco ball and everybody was like, Dries is going to stay and dance the whole night. And then I just like went back later and he was still talking. He talked to people for two hours and he answered my questions and was like so generous. But the amazing thing about that show was regardless of whether or not Margella actually showed up, it was a beautiful clothes. It didn't feel sentimental at all. I mean, of course the model was the first look. That was a cool story. Yeah. It was like the first model who had ever walked and all of that, but like walked one of his shows, but it didn't feel nostalgic. And it was just sort of another really good show. And that made me optimistic about like, so if it had been, because it sort of felt this whole week has sort of felt like the end of the session. People were acting like he was dying. Like it was like, it was really extreme. And it's because, but I think it's because he made clothes that people actually wore. He's not like an enigma. He's a guy who makes clothes that you buy and wear and that's a big difference. 100%. And I think also, especially in fashion, there was a whole thing with him where they were very generous with their personal order policy. So they pretty much let any one place a personal order and it was really affordable. So like $120 t-shirt was $37 or something. And I remember one year I got like pants, two jackets, a bunch of shirts, a bunch of whatever. And so they were always very generous. And I remember when they stopped doing it, I think it was before he announced that he was, he was stopping and they were like, they stopped the personal orders. Cause that stuff can get really dangerous if you do a lot of personal orders. Cause suddenly you get this order and it's like, you owe us $3,000 and I don't really remember what I ordered. You know what I mean? I'll pay you, but I don't know what this is. But it was like everyone, I did not bring a lot of my clothes from him or more like winter and I didn't really, I brought some t-shirts, but that's it on this trip. But everyone was wearing Dries. And I think that is part of it, that he is like, not really part of the system. He's done it differently. He prices everything differently. They ran their own business forever when they sold. The company didn't really fuck up the business. The fragrance that he's done is really nice. Like very, some of the best packaging I've ever seen. It's amazing. So good. It's, and I wear it. It's, it's great. But so he started doing everything right. And thinking about him and Tom Brown, who also has had, had like a really good exit with a partner who hasn't kind of screwed with his business. And then I also went to Rick Owens and, and Sakai, like the shows that I went to this week were all brands that like, I don't think if they were started today, that they could exist. No, absolutely not. Absolutely not. I mean, the Rick Owens thing is like a spectacle that is, it is very difficult for anyone to parse that's basically not there, you know, like to, to understand that is to kind of be there. Um, but yeah, I mean, I think it just financially doesn't make sense. No, like how could they exist without the history? You know, if you didn't have the fall, it takes so long to get that following and those businesses feel a little bit like Rick. Owens feels a little bit, uh, above trends because of the clientele. Totally. And, and I think like that kind of business Rick Owens has been building that business for 30 years up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down. Also, and that's the other thing. Like right now I was talking to someone who launched a brand in the last two years and they were like, we just don't know what to do. And a friend of mine has a line and she had a big, big order with matches and matches isn't paying anyone and they aren't going to pay anyone. And, and I said to her, I was like, you got to just factor this in that it's going to happen every two years. And so how do you build something into a 50, 100, 150 million dollar business, which is what a lot of these were when at this time or when they, when they got sold and I just don't think it's possible in the current climate because you need wholesale for marketing and you also need wholesale to drive your direct sales. But wholesale you can like lose 500 grand in a blink of an eye now. No problem. I mean, I think it's also like the consolidation of everything, you know, like with, with streaming, it'll be Netflix and then some like combination of Disney and Hulu will be the two that we have, you know, and the same thing with like retail. I don't think there's going to be much left as far as multi-brand goes in the very near future.

Make the switch to Bokeh for the whole family at BOKA.com. As someone who's worked a lot in marketing of brands, like, what do you think the balance between the product being good and the marketing being good? So that's something that's come up a lot this week. I had a little item in Line Sheet on Monday about all these like chief brand officers and head of comms, they're all like leaving their jobs or quitting or getting fired or taking new jobs in CMOs. And because the business is not doing well right now, everyone is looking at the marketing side to sort of figure out. Maybe that's what's wrong. Whereas I, my feeling is like, if the product's not good, it doesn't matter how good the marketing is. But like, what do you think the balance is? Yeah. I mean, that's something I say all the time. If the stuff is good, people will buy it and marketing can only do so much. I mean, I think Jacques Mouss is the best example of bad clothes, amazing marketing. Like he's a genius. Like when it's like nothing we've ever seen before, but no one talks about the clothes, no one, that's not even part of the conversation. And I think that's a fine line you want to walk. But then something like, I mean, in a traditional fashion world, it's like you shoot these campaigns and there's, you need, I think some consistency is really helpful. Like I think that's why Celine works is because it's so consistent and you know what you're getting. And it's still glamorous and sexy. But I also think that everyone leans, I think people think marketing now is collaborations. And that can be true. I think, you know, depending on what it is, but that's not a surefire way to succeed anymore because the marketplace is just too full. How do you, when you're approaching that kind of stuff, like how do you decide what makes sense for a collaboration? Cause it's not always brand on brand. Sometimes it's like person and brand. Sometimes it's idea and like there are all these different types of collaborations at this point. I mean, all of that stuff just has to be authentic. If it's with a person, it has to be a person who's like a true fan of the brand and like understands it. But I think that it's often about money, which is, you know, unfortunate. But I think that the whole issue with all of this stuff is authenticity. And I think that we got, we got wrapped up and distracted. And I think that like a J. Crew specifically, I think authenticity is something we talk about all the time and how to modernize kind of the catalog heyday and like bridge that gap and make it feel really authentic. And I think that's always what the goal is and collaborations, if done wrong, can feel very inauthentic, which turns people off. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Chris, I wanted to ask you one more thing before we get to the rumor of the week. What do you think of this brat summer situation? Did you talk about this on how long gone already? I mean, look, we've talked about it a lot. We're very pro Charlie. I love her. I think she's like a superstar. And I think that something of this caliber from someone at her level has kind of never been seen before. Like this is she's Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera at this point right now. You know what I mean? As far as like cultural relevance goes. And I think that it's it's really interesting. She's charting really well. The shows are obviously insane. Like the Lord remix is amazing. It's just it's just really smart and really well done. And the music is not usually my thing, but it's good. And I listen to it. Yeah. What do you have you watched the Brat Pack documentary? No, everybody told me it was so bad that I shouldn't watch it. But I will because I'm really interested in it. But I just don't when I found out that he's not even in the New York magazine article that he's referencing in the whole documentary. I have I have a tough time with that. I I there was a request from someone in my office for me to address all of this stuff and I was like, I don't really have an opinion of any of this. I mean, I obviously followed very closely the Brat Pack and think of it in an aesthetic sense and like the aesthetics of those films and how they affected my aesthetics and all of that all the time. One man's experience doesn't matter that much. It's also like, bro, you're not Rob Lowe. You know what I'm saying? It's like we only care. We can only care so much. No, we talked about we talked about it a little bit. We talked about it a little bit. Each spring, twenty three Pulitzer Prizes are rewarded for distinguished journalism, books, drama and music.

So let's get to the rumor of the week. There are so many. I am in Paris. There are so many rumors. I can't even begin. But the one that I think is really interesting to explore with you is Advogue World. So there's been a lot of designers out and about this week. They've been good. Like Pierre Palo is like, he's out and about. Hider Ackerman's out. They were both at Dries. Pierre Palo, he was also at the Met. Like he's just out. Like he's like at shows. Pharrell has gone. Pharrell was at. He goes to Sky a lot. I think he's friends with her. So I think he's just always goes. But he was obviously at Kenzo. Very supportive wearing a Kenzo hat at Sakai. I think he was obviously also at Vogue World. But they were just a lot of designers out and about. But Pierre Palo. And then because I had heard Sarah Burton was supposed to go to the Met and she didn't go. I heard that from a very good source. Like a last minute. I'm not going. Yes. And the thing is she's not a super like. She's she's not like out and about like she's not a social designer. So I did meet her at the London Fashion Awards once and she I wrote. She was really lovely. But but she's not like out and about. She's not a partier. She's not, you know, well, I mean, maybe she is. I don't know. But she's not. She's not hanging out with fashion people all the time at major events. So she was at Vogue World. And the interesting thing is. About two weeks ago, I heard from a really good source, a source who also knew that knew that Virginie VR had been left, left, had left whatever happened. Perusion Insider. A perusion Insider. An insider. And they said the Sarah Burton deal is done. It's done. She signed. She's going to Givenchy. Then I heard from someone else that like she's definitely the top candidate. And that I've heard from a lot of people within within the LVMH kind of universe. My guess is I don't think she would have gone to this event if something wasn't up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I completely agree. And the other thing was that Galeana was there and he was seated between Anna. Anna was seated between him and Pharrell. That obviously means nothing. But I've heard a lot about him. Not being at Margella anymore. We'll see. Like he's doing amazing stuff there. But I mean, the rumor mill here is just like so out of control. It's crazy. But the Sarah Burton thing, like what do you think about that? You follow women's fashion pretty closely as a as a confirmed straight male. Yeah, yeah. Yes, as a confirmed straight man, finally, I'm glad we got that on the record. No, I I mean, I think that like, if you know, you're about to get this big job, you got to start trotting yourself out there and being part of the conversation. You know, I don't think that like, I think that's just good business. And even if you're adverse to it, then you should get another job because this that's part of the deal now, whether we like it or not. Yeah. The crazy thing about what's happening right now is like, there is so much that could happen that we don't know. So we don't know about Celine. Like it's 99.9% confirmed that Michael Ryder is going there, but Hedy still works there right now. We definitely don't know about Chanel. We definitely don't know about Givenchy. We don't know what's going to happen. Kenzo feels like completely up in up in the air, whether Nego is going to stay or not. There is the question of, I guess McQueen is pretty settled because that guy just got there, so they need to give him a chance. Gucci, they seem to be sticking with Sabato, but who knows what will happen after the fall show. I feel like he really need if the sales pick up in the summer, it'll be okay. But if not, who knows? Do you think though that these, do you think people are getting enough time to fail or succeed? Like do you think it's going to get a lot, that cycle is going to come too fast at a certain point? I think the issue with Gucci is that that brand is too big to have someone work it out. Yeah, yeah. They don't have five years. And it's not anyone's fault. That's what I truly believe that. That like the market is screwed up. The positioning of the way they positioned him and that first collection wasn't exactly right. But when I look at that first collection, it was actually pretty, I think maybe the best collection he did. I don't know. The second, the second season was a little bit better, but there was something not totally right about the positioning. But the problem is like the product is just getting, there was 7% of the product in the last quarter was in the stores. So it's just getting in the stores. People buy it, but the other issue is no one's buying anything. So even if they like it, it's not, it's not going to be crazy because every brand is struggling right now. So there is just like so much uncertainty. And I feel like a lot of these, these companies, they have to do a course correct, like the business was splitting into two. One side of commodity where it's just like rich people buy this stuff like it's Zara, they buy one thing a week and they're just like, I don't care. I'll buy all of it. That looks like Kenzo is thinking about that sitting there. Like the clothes are perfectly fine, but like they have no personality, but people who go to Bloomingdale's and they just buy like one skirt for 500 bucks. It's, they don't think of it as being Kenzo. They're just like, I want to buy a skirt. There is a, there's the type of person that shops at, at stores like that, like it's Zara H&M because it's just like, this is where I'm at financially. Yeah. And I think that there's this other customer and increasingly more and more customers who are like, I don't want to do that anymore. And it's, they're moving away. I was talking to someone who's involved in fashion industry, but also design and furniture and, and all that stuff. And they were like, people want to buy vintage cars. They want to do up their houses and they want to buy fancy furniture and watches. And they do not want to spend like, I went to Prada today and there was a men's shirt that I saw in some women's magazine, like on a woman. I went in the other day. I couldn't find in the women's section. I looked it up as men's in the U S it's, it's a cotton, poplin, blue and white check shirt, like sort of a camp shirt or whatever. $2,400 in the U S. And I went to Prada here and I was like, maybe it'll be, you know, I, I would have, I would spend a thousand bucks on that. Eighteen hundred euros. And I was like, is it on the sales? Cause I know they're doing the private sales. Nope. They were like, no, it's not. That is truly a, who is this for? Yeah. And the thing is like Prada is the one brand that I have logo shit. Like I would not wear logo stuff with any of, but I love them. I love what they do. I love the shirt, little triangle at the back of the neck. Like that's funny. I'm really adverse to that triangle. Like the nylon stuff, I think is so cool, but I could never wear that logo. I don't mind it on the back where you don't wear it doesn't say Prada. And I also have a pair of the like architectural swirly shoes where the Prada is in sequence. Like, so you can't see it. Yeah, that's like hidden by the sequence. But, um, but yeah, it's just, I think like they are the last ones that can pull it off because people are just obsessed with what they're doing. All these other brands, like it just all looks the same. No, anytime I look at prices, I'm usually stunned. I mean, I like, I like to do it to shock myself kind of because, but I think it's what you're saying. It's like cotton, poplin or like nylon, like these things that like just aren't expensive in our minds are being priced at such a great in such a crazy way that I don't, I don't know who that's for. Like, I don't know who's buying that shirt for $2,400. No. And the margins on that stuff is not, it's, it's just like, it's not this, these, it's, it's getting great. And I obviously the cost of raw materials has gone up and all that stuff. It's getting nuts. Anyway, you, you, you like the idea of Sarah Burton at Givenchy. Sure. I mean, anybody's better than who it was. I mean, will he ever work in this town again? Oh, he'll be just fine. I mean, I think that I think he'll be just fine. I mean, I don't know if, you know, people want stuff with buckles on it anymore, but I could be surprised. Or with such complicated labels. Very, very complicated. Remember when it just used to be called a leaks? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I mean, I, I, I remember the entire trajectory. Don't you worry. Someone needs to write a book. I mean, I think that this is what you're talking about though. I think that's, you know, at a certain point, these like houses were willing to take risks, you know, and like pay someone a lot of money that was just kind of unproven and sometimes that can work and sometimes it doesn't. And that's, I don't think they're in a financial position to do that anymore. I think the choices have to be really labored over and researched and you can't go with your gut or hope something's going to work. No, 100%. Chris, thank you for being on fashion people.
