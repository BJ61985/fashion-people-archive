Hope you're having a great week. I'm in the middle of my holiday, so I'm going to keep this short. If there was breaking news while I was out, rest assured. I'll be addressing it next week. Don't worry. You know that whatever came out, I have more than people are saying, so don't worry about it. If you have something for me, send me a WhatsApp or whatever, trying not to pay attention. But just again, if something happens, don't worry. I will have more upon my return and make it worth your while. Today, though, enjoy this episode with Amanda, who is an expert on all things Sophia Coppola. I thought it would be fun to discuss Sophia in depth with someone outside of the fashion industry who could speak to her influence more holistically and her business generally. Maybe Sophia would come on at some point to discuss it with me. We'll see. Anyway, Amanda and I had a great time, and I hope you do too. Amanda Dobbins, welcome to Fashion People. This is a true honor. Thank you so much for having me. I am so honored to have a professional podcaster on my podcast. I think you're professional too. You are not cutting yourself enough slack. You were wonderful on one of my podcast, Jam Session. We got great feedback, so I'm excited to continue it. I know. This is the month of Jam People. Jam People? So I still haven't tasted the Megan Jam. I wanted to tell you, I was listening to your podcast this morning with your colleague, Rob, who has a great podcasting voice. He does. And I wanted to tell you, I do know someone who tasted it. Okay. Well, then maybe would that person be willing to do a call in segment? Yeah, there we go. That's the thing. This person, I don't know if I sent you the quote. This person, I asked, can I use this in anonymous feedback online? And she said, no. Okay. Because it's just too close. So everything I'm, yes, exactly. This person is close. And it just, it seems like not that much jam was made because I have been trying to find someone who even knows someone. We can have several degrees of separation to report on this jam as the journalist that I am that there are scare quotes on that. And then I also was straight up like, I'm trying to enter the jam resell market. Like I offered $100 and there is, I have gotten absolutely no takers, which just says to me that not that much, like there aren't that many people who have access to the jam. I agree. The only person that I know who got the jam is Elizabeth Holmes. Right. And I think she said what she said her piece. So. Also, I'm doing this for content and so is she. So I thought that was a great marketing move on everybody's part. It was very savvy and Elizabeth Holmes has worked very hard. And then she gets to review it on her platforms. But you know, that people, when I asked listeners to help me locate some jam, everyone kept sending me Elizabeth Holmes's Instagram as if that would be useful to me. And it's, you know, it's okay. I hope everyone who got the jam enjoyed it. Yes. Unfortunately, you know what though? I think because the other person I know, I actually know two people because I know Elizabeth and she publicly got the jam. But I know this other person who got the jam, who doesn't want me to send the line, line about the review of the jam to publish it. I think I probably do know a few other people. I'm going to do some work on this on my, my flight home tomorrow. Okay. Did you have jam for breakfast and what did you have for breakfast? Because on Friday shows, that's the first question we ask. So I knew this was coming and it was a tricky day because I'm going to tell you I had a 10 30 AM solid core class. Okay. Shout out solid core Pasadena. I'm a loyal member. Thanks to Lauren's recommendation. It's too good. I want this. I went yesterday morning in New York. It was really hard today. They did obliques right after core warm up and I just like, I don't have that in me. Anyway, so normally I wouldn't have breakfast before a 10 30 AM class. I would just be coffee with more real dairy than most people do. But because I knew you were going to ask, I ate the rest of my son's Greek yogurt with granola and blueberries. Sounds delicious. And I said no to the leftover banana bread and had the Greek yogurt instead because I didn't want to hear about sugar content from you. The last person actually who was on last Friday, Mark Metric, he said he eats Catalina Crunch. What is that? Do you even know about this as a person who eats real sugar? It's like this cereal that you can get at Sprouts that looks sort of like Chex Mix, but it is high protein and no sugar. And there's net carbs, one. Cinnamon sugar. Okay. I had Michelle's granola. Are you familiar with Whole Foods best? I think it probably, it says it's grain free on the label. There probably is some real sugar. I'm a person who eats refined sugar every day. And so far I've lived to tell the tale. Michelle's granola as far as Whole Foods offerings go is pretty good. The granola inflation is real. I would say prices have doubled by, or not doubled, but up 50% since we became Michelle granola customers. But it's good. And who knows how much it'll cost when this actually runs because this is running during my vacation and that's several days from now so it might even be triple the cost. Go to Linecheap for more information on tariffs. Just kidding. Who knows? Every day it's different. We can't put it down. So I wanted to have you on the podcast for a very special episode. I'm going on a big vacation. I'm not going to work during this vacation. And I figured what would be an evergreen podcast that the fashion people listeners would be into and would be fun to do. And I've wanted for a while to do our podcast on The Row that I did with Misty Whitesidell, who writes for the New York Times, was very popular because we just kind of talked about what made The Row successful, challenges of The Row, et cetera. Please listen to it if you haven't. I loved it. I learned a lot, including what a skew is. Oh, thank you. That's what I texted you, being like, what is a skew? Yes, a skew is a stock keeping unit for everyone. And that is something, and it essentially means a style. So if you have a unique skew, you have a unique style. So it is like retail jargon that I forget that people don't know. So thank you for asking. It's okay. I've just added myself as the non-fashion expert on this podcast, but that's okay. Well, you're pretty knowledgeable and also you are interested in fashion. And also you are an expert on Sophia Coppola. And I feel like if anyone didn't notice, Amanda and I are friends, and I feel like Sophia is a shared interest. Absolutely. And I thought it would be fun to have you on to talk about how her film career kind of connects to the fashion industry and why you like her and why you like her movies, but also you like the way she dresses. And it's going to be really fun. I thought we could start with what was your first experience with Sophia Coppola? How did you develop an interest in her? Was it through images of her? Was it through her movies? It was through Lost in Translation, which came out when I was in college and also crucially was a big Oscars contender. And in fact, Sophia Coppola won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Lost in Translation. And I have always been a huge Oscars nerd. Like we're talking 10 years old reading Entertainment Weekly, which is just not the coolest thing that I've ever said in public, but is true. And so I think that I always tried to see all of the Oscar films. And I remember seeing Lost in Translation. I also remember it being a movie of interest to the people I was hanging out with and like the slightly older people that I knew in college. And I was like, oh, there's like something cool going on here. And I was obviously immediately taken by that movie. And then I do think that I sought out the Virgin Suicides, or maybe they, you know, kind of showed it through the film program in college. But I did enough research. And I also was probably impacted by that. Lynn Hirschberg piece about Sophia Coppola around the time of Lost in Translation. Because I was also very interested in media and, you know, still a big celebrity profile. I mean, it still matters to me, but definitely made an impact. And so I remember I became interested enough that I was there opening weekend for Marie Antoinette, which is 2006. So through the movies, but I think in the best way through the movies, I learned a lot about fashion, a lot about music, a lot about other movies. You know, she thinks Wong Kar-Wai in her Oscar speech, or she did. And that led me down the road of his films. So she's kind of, I guess, been a portal to everything cool in the world that I know about. I think for a lot of people in the mood for love, Wong Kar-Wai, is that his most famous film? Yes, I think so. It is the most referenced film in fashion by fashion designers. It is everyone's favorite film. It's Tim, I don't know if it's Tim Blanks' favorite film, but it's one of his favorite. It's a number one. So I think that is how it's so closely connected. It's interesting. For me, it was Milkfed, her fashion line, and also The Godfather, part three. Oh, interesting. Yes, because I grew up single mom and we used to rent every single movie. So basically a movie from 1985 to 1995 that wasn't a horror film I've seen. I've seen like, truly madly deeply, like every single movie. It's an incredible movie. Evan and Mangel is first, right? With Alan Rickman? It's with Alan Rickman. I have no idea if I didn't even know that Anthony Mangel directed it. But yes, so all of that stuff I saw when I was really young and I remember watching. I watched a lot of movies inappropriately young, famously watched Twin Peaks when I was eight years old. My mom was just like, this is great. You should watch this stuff. But I remember watching her in that movie and she's notoriously very bad. And I didn't think that movie was bad while I was growing up. I guess it's considered not to be good. But I do remember she wasn't a great actress. But my mom said, you might look like that when you grow up. So the complex of me. What did she mean by that? She was just like, I could see like, that's kind of what you're going to look like when you grow up. Okay. I mean. Which I, you know, in no way, but like completely delusional. But it was just a thing of I was, I was like, oh, this woman, this girl, she was still a girl, was like beautiful and interesting. And then combined with the fact that I was learning that she had this cool fashion line called Milk Fed. Right. And she was in all the cool magazines and all of that. So by the time her Gensuicides came out, I think I might have seen it in the theaters. I don't know. But it, she was like already a thing to me. Right. In terms of being obsessed with her like aesthetic, her and Kim Gordon and, and Spike Jones, who I definitely didn't know who that was when I was that age. But that whole scene of people became a real thing for me. And there was Jeff McFedridge, this artist who did the logo for Virgin Suicides and worked with Spike Jones on, I think it was like a skate magazine. There's a documentary about him that I went to see at that Neutra house that's, or is it Frank Lloyd Wright in the Barnes doll art, art park? I think it's Frank Lloyd Wright. Yeah. And they have like a little screening remind and I went to see it. Warby Parker did the screening and Spike interviewed Jeff and, but in the film, Sophia's in it, Spike's in it. And I was like, these are the last cool people that ever existed in my mind. Absolutely. They, they were really cool. And Sophia's in like a cashmere sweatshirt and all her fancy jewelry and she still looks so cool. Yeah. Well, they were a type of cool that you and I can't actually attain, but they're a type of cool that I would like to try to attain and to imitate. And we'll, I think we'll talk a lot about Sophia Coppola's personal aesthetic and its influence, like on our lives. But everything that she wears, does, says honestly, both cracks me up and is incredibly enviable. And if, if, if I were cool enough and you know, if I had the means and the pedigree and everything that she had, it is how I would like to, it's how I would choose to dress, live, make art, whatever. I do think you do a pretty good job at capturing the essence. Thanks. I mean, I really try. Sometimes I, when I'm packing for a trip, like an adult trip, no kids. And I'm, I don't know like what to pack. I just like Google Sophia Coppola's street style. And I'm like, okay, so like here I just, I need to get back to basics, right? Like we, this is how we're going to put this together. We just wear what Sophia would wear. It's so true. And, and I was going to bring up the Rory, Rory, Rory, Saitrin, who is the Wall Street Journal's fashion director and also Donnie Maul, who is the editor-in-chief of fashion. He said they both written about this. It's kind of like the, what would Jesus do of Sophia Coppola? It's what would Sophia Coppola wear? And I do think, or would, or would she buy this? I think Donnie says, what would she wear? And Rory says, what would she buy this? And it is a good, it isn't just a good, I thought about it on this trip to New York because I had two events where I had to like look appropriate. And I thought about would she like, what would she wear to these events? And it was easier for me to put it together. Right. So it's probably a small group of people who are thinking this way, but it's a powerful group. But it's a, it was sure, it's a broad reference. I always think about, I've always been slightly intimidated by the fashion world. You know, you are, you navigate these circles and runways with ease. And I am fascinated, but I don't really mingle. I just observe. And part of it is because I'm always intimidated by like, well, what would I wear? And I don't, you know, I don't look like I'm in a fashion magazine, but, and it's not even that. This is not like a body image thing. It's more just, I would look silly if I were like done up for the cover of Vogue, you know, that's that I have a different path in life. But the reality is, is that the actual fashion people, they dress differently and they dress with a lot of style, but not with flashiness. And Sophia has, to me, has always exemplified like the absolute pinnacle of that. And it's a little bit uniform, but it's just every single piece is still exactly what you want. It's lived in. It's not showy, but she still looks very chic. And that is, that's how I want to look. So it's, we're, I guess we'll talk about the clothes in her movies, but, and you asked me to put together examples and I did. And obviously the clothes are really important to her movies, but most of my examples are just like pictures of her on the street in a striped shirt, right? Totally. And I, and I also think her personal aesthetic is reflected in her films. Like you think about Marie Antoinette even and the pink sneakers. Yeah. There, there is, it's so connected.

Well, this is going to sound dismissive and I don't actually mean it. Dismissively, I mean it with great respect for her and also for all of the art and the media that I'm about to reference. But it really, it is high fashion photography turned into film. It is about, it is young women in beautiful clothes and or interesting clothes in beautiful places and or interesting places perfectly composed, which like all films should be, but I see a lot of movies and I got to tell you, not everybody understands composition. And done with a particular, like eye for a frame and a photograph. I mean, she I think studied both painting and photography. She references a lot of photographers in her wonderful book, Sophia Coppola Archive. So, and she is also like a person who I think has read as many fashion magazines as we have and reveres them and sees the art in them as opposed to the commerciality. And so much of her work is and her films are about young women and also about surfaces and exteriors versus what's going on inside, what's going on underneath. And so there is a lot of attention paid to the surfaces, the costumes, the set, the actual visuals of what you're seeing to communicate both something about what you're seeing, but also what might be going on behind it. Does she use the same interiors like set designer every time or as she evolved it over the years? I think she evolves it because a lot of times they're filming on location, like they filmed at Versailles. They were the first for Marie Antoinette. They were the first film that could ever film at Versailles. Obviously, Lawson Translation and somewhere are in hotels, real live hotels that you can still visit. So I think and then, for example, Priscilla, they couldn't film at Graceland. It was a very tight budget. So then they just had to recreate Graceland. So I think it's a little bit of who's available and what the task is. How much do you think? Because in terms of costume designer, so she worked on, I think, I don't know if on Virgin Suicides, but on Lawson Translation, it was Nancy Steiner. Let me just, that's her name, right? Yes. Who has done a lot of really amazing stuff. She also did, what's that movie with Carrie Mulligan that the Emerald Fennell movie? Oh, A Promising Young Woman. She did A Promising Young Woman, which is interesting because there's an underwear moment in that movie too. Nancy Steiner is awesome. She did the Twin Peaks, the Return as well. I just think she's really amazing. And in more recent movies, she's worked with Stacey Batat, who is connected to a lot of fashion industry people. She's really cool. I've obviously never mentioned the fact that I'm obsessed with Sophia's movie star. Right. But it feels to me like if you look at the movies where it's set in real life, so Lawson Translation or, I guess, Contemporary or On the Rocks. And those were two different costume designers. But you could see that Scarlett Johansson's, APC, and Eric's underwear in Lawson Translation were Sophia's. Yes, absolutely. And Rashida Jones' Stripe Shirt and where it was Sophia's in On the Rocks. How do you think she works with costume designers to tell more of the story? Because some directors are really into that and some of them, it feels like they don't consider it as much. I think she's incredibly involved. And we know that because she's so interested in fashion. I have always wondered how conscious the Scarlett Johansson as Sophia costuming in Lawson Translation was. And I think it's pretty intentional, right? But the button-down shirts, the trench coat, as a director, do you think she's sitting there being like, okay, so just dress her like me? Or do you think that there is some sort of unspoken understanding between Nancy Steiner and Sophia that we're going for this look that is just stuff that Sophia wears? I think on On the Rocks, she's talked about being a little bit... She's been a little more up front about the Rashida Jones character as a doppelganger. So maybe there is a little bit of... Or, you know, like a stand-in for her, I guess. Yeah. So maybe there is a little bit more of knowingness. But in terms of, you know, the really... Those are the two real life. Those are the two Sophia stand-ins, I guess, though arguably they all are. And then she has things like Marie Antoinette, which is just completely over the top. And Priscilla, which also involved recreating a huge number of costumes, and she'll tell you about, you know, calling in the favors from Chanel and Valentino for Priscilla. She'll tell you about the costume fittings for Marie Antoinette. So I think... And, you know, the color references. And I think, like, the directive for Marie Antoinette was just like the pastries, like the lingerie macarons were just kind of, let's lean into that. And that really is the color palette for the entire movie, clothing, whatever. So I think she's really involved. I think she thinks of the clothes as a character, or at least as an essential part of character development, which they really are in all her movies. Because again, they're about, for the most part, young women navigating the world and navigating the world's expectations of them. And also, like, the public and private a lot, right? Which is another Sophia thing, of she's obviously a person who's been in the public eye in one way or another, since she was very young. So how they look, what they're wearing is essential to who they are in the film. Yeah, she's such an interesting person because she seems kind of shy, but also open. I've only interviewed her a couple of times in very controlled environments. But I remember once she was like, have we met before? And I was like, I interviewed you on the red carpet for Sachi for H&M. It was that kind of thing. But she feels very comfortable and she's open to doing interviews and talking to people. And it doesn't feel self-promotional. It feels like she wants to give back to people who are interested in her work and having a dialogue about her work. So I think that openness is a reason why, of course, she interned at Chanel when she was young and wanted to be a fashion designer and decided not to do it. And you can watch the A24 videos or whatever of her talking about this stuff. But in the way she treats fashion with so much respect, and even when she's doing commercial projects with the fashion industry, like she did these windows for Chanel that are on Rodeo Drive, which is like the most commercial thing you could ever do. And they're amazing. She clearly puts an effort and work into it. And what is her in your world, what is her respect level? And do you think because she is so interested in those sort of top line aesthetics, it's been hard, and also obviously her background and all that stuff. But do you think it's been harder for her to gain the same amount of respect to say like someone like Wes Anderson, who is equally as interested, but is a man and who's a peer of hers in a lot of way. I think that she is extremely well respected. There still is, you know, I co-host a film podcast and with a- Called the Big Picture. It's called The Big Picture. My friend and co-host, Sean Fantasy, is a centifile and a huge enthusiast of all types of movies, including Sophia Coppola's. But you know, it is when a Sophia movie comes out, it's like it's a man of time, you know, there is something still a little gendered about that. But I do think that her specific vision and her ability to to just like to bring what could be lightweight subjects or that's not fair actually because I think that that's my internalized misogyny. Lauren, I'm sorry. But you know, most people don't take Teenage Girl seriously, right? And she has taken them seriously and made them the centerpiece of most of the stories in a way. And then made cinema that that uses not necessarily the like the rules of dude cinema, but at least recognizable hallmarks. She uses serious cinematographers. She uses fine art references. And so people take her seriously. And I think even men take her seriously, even if it's like, you know, girls time to shine. I think I'm sure that the the dad stuff held her back and she'll even talk you about that. And she'll talk about how Godfather three was like not a positive experience for me. And she was like pretty maligned about it. But I do think now there is this whole like Coppola clan saying that's happening because so many of the next generation have gone on to be like meaningful filmmakers, her brother Roman, Jason Schwartzman is a cousin, Gia Coppola, you know, just made the last show girl. So I think she is taken seriously. And maybe because she's working in slightly with higher end references taken more seriously than someone like say Nancy Meyers, who your point about Wes Anderson and the and the composition and the fancy clothes and everything being just so is I think a good comp. But in terms of stories about women using design and and clothes and everything, because Sophia is like working with Chanel, right? And then Nancy Meyers, people are wearing, you know, beautiful gap or I guess nor Efron's really the the the gap. But it's it's a lower market. And it does seem like without the gloss, people don't take it as seriously. Yeah, she has the she's a real fashion person. She's she's in the she's in the inner circle. Yeah. And everyone should also sign up for pucks in her circle to access all of my reporting. The interesting thing, point on Nora Efron versus your girl Nancy Meyers versus her daughter. They're both my girl. They're both your the all these one moment of sexism. But I'm back and I embrace everyone. They're all your women. I would say as a person inside the fashion industry, Nora Efron to me, totally nailed it every time. And it was more accessible, I think, too. But like you've got male was all Mark Jacobs. And it just looks like preppy clothes. But it was all Mark Jacobs and Nora Efron herself. I remember there was a shoot in like 2008 or 2009 for Vogue. And it might have been when the neck article, the neck book came out about my neck. Yeah. Yes. Because the funny thing is, I'm starting to feel bad about my neck and I've been thinking about that book so much. But she was wearing all like Raf Simons, Jill Sanders, she had amazing taste. And I think Nancy, I think you're right. And I thought it's interesting because Nancy Meyers daughter just did a movie that you really loved starring Michael Keaton. Okay, let's let's put it some context. I enjoyed and recommended to you and you got a lot of plain content out of it. So and at least one newsletter item. Yes. So in that sense, we all had a lovely time. Yes. And the movie is called Good Rich. Good Rich. But the costumes are so perfect. And I think it is a thing of they're just the color composition, the items that they chose. I don't know what designers, the actors were wearing, but it just was so specific. And I think that's the thing that all these women share. And you're right. And the funny thing is when I think about Nancy Meyers and I think about Wes Anderson, my honest opinion is like, I'm pretty much out on him. I am grateful but the last few and you do know that I fall asleep at most movies. So yeah, it's not. I mean, that's, listen, you travel a lot. Okay. So that's, that's what's happening. That's why I, but I would say Nancy Meyers, once I realized that she had not directed as good as it gets, because I thought that for decades. Right. That's, I really love. That's James L. Brooks. Yeah. Yes. And I was like, now I understand why I didn't like that movie. And I liked all, I like a lot of his movies, but not that one. But I think they all have that ability to like get to, if you dress a certain way and it's not about the brands and that's the thing that is with her too. Like I know young designers who Sophia's bought stuff from directly and it's not fancy stuff, but she just knows the right thing. And when you know the exact right item, it can be very emotional. Yeah. And she buys the things and then I spend hours just like secondhand, Googling what, we don't have enough like what Sophia wore blogs, you know, now that, now that Megan's doing the shop, my can what Megan wore just like transfer to what Sophia wore, not that I can afford it. I think you should do, you should start a sub-stack with every time she, she comes out and you could also shop the show every time she does a film, if it's contemporary. That does seem like a lot of work. I'm not in the affiliate links phase of my life yet. I know that you do it beautifully.

I mean, number one, the Charbet shirt, right? And this is not even, I have bought some Charbet shirts from the RealReal, you know, as we have all dabbled in our time, but I still have never been to Charbet to have a custom shirt measured for me, as Sophia does. The last time that I was in Paris, I don't get to go to Paris as often as Lauren does. And so, I was five or six months pregnant, I think, and we went to Charbet, my husband and I, and my husband got a shirt. And everyone at Charbet was so lovely. They offered, they were so great, and, you know, they offered to custom, first of all, they offered me a seat as soon as I walked in. Shout out the nice people of Paris. Although, it was also like, you know, in America, no one will say anything, right? And then I landed in Paris, and like, at the Charles de Gaulle, at the line, they were like, okay, pregnant lady, come this way. And I was like, what happened on the plane? One of the best things about France is that if you have a kid or you're pregnant, you get to skip the line. Yeah, so I did get to skip the line. Anyway, the lovely people at Charbet immediately offered me a seat. Then, you know, they said, we do make custom shirts for women if you'd like to do that. And I said, you know, I don't really think this is the best time for me to be measured for a custom shirt. But they understood and they said, okay, so do you want to come like, see the workshop? And so then I just got to go in and just like run my hands over. I didn't actually touch anything, but all the bolts of fabric for like 15 minutes. And it was wonderful. So I hope to be able to do that at some point in my life. I've also bought like a million blue and white button down shirts, trying to recreate the ease of whatever shirts Sophia is wearing all of the time. And it is pretty much a staple of my wardrobe at this point. For sure. And Charvet is such a special experience, but it is something that's the thing about the way she dresses is it's just components. And yes, you want to have the brand. I remember she wrote about her stationery brand once and I went to the shop in Paris. And you want to have the thing that she has, but you also you can kind of build it. Right. And also, I think like the striped shirt you're wearing one today. Yes, I am definitely wearing it. I thought of it as I put it on. And I think she has driven. When Chanel was looking for its creative director, Steph Yacca, one of my old colleagues and who is now, I think her title is editorial director at ID came on. And we talked about like, wouldn't Sophia Coppola be a great designer for Chanel? And there is something like the best and not the best designers, but the most impactful designers influence the way real people dress. So Raf Simmons puts a nightgown on Dior's runway show in 2013. And suddenly Hill House Home exists 10 years later. Like these are the things that are amazing. I am Phoebe Filo, a designer who Sophia Coppola wears. I'm sure she has actual Phoebe Filo, the brand name stuff, but she wore a lot of Celine on the red carpet when she was designing it. Is like that too, like they're the cut of a sweater that I like eternal, the eternal next sweaters we all have still feel inspired by the one she did at Celine. But I think Sophia Coppola has that too. Like what do you the Charvet shirt, the striped shirt, what are the other components of her wardrobe? One side note before I do this, just do you know the story of Sophia Coppola and Jane Campion serving on a film festival jury together? And Jane Campion is like, oh, I think that it's I'm finding all of like the photo ops, you know, and figuring out all the the dressing to be a little overwhelming. And so he was like, Oh, I can have a friend send some things. And then like the next day, five bags of Celine show up at Jane Campion, the director's hotel room. I don't think so. That's amazing. Really, really, really, really elite stuff. Okay, so what else in the Sophia, the building block? So, you know, pants are next. A lot of jeans, you know, which is, which is just great normal jeans, not particularly trend focused as I can as as I can recall. And then and then the car heart pants, right? Yes, or the or the dickies, or she did a New York magazine, that's the strategist, things I can't live without. And she recommended a pair of Noah pants men's. Oh, yeah. I couldn't go as far as buying Noah pants for myself. I agree. I have the Noah barber collaboration jacket, a barn jacket, that's enough. Yeah, there are men in my life and who love Noah. And I think that's great for them. Also, at some point, we're just dealing with, so if you could was very petite, I'm taller, I don't really know that the men's pants are going to hit me in the same way that they're going to hit Sophia. But the inspiration is there, right? So sort of work where inspired trousers and or jeans with the button down shirts, sneakers and or Chanel ballet flats, a trench coat or a navy or striped sweater, a really, really expensive bag, usually that she designed with Marc Jacobs or whatever that I can't afford. What am I forgetting? I would say the Chanel jacket, which I have a junior wantonabi jacket that I bought at Scout that is like the junior version of the Chanel jacket. And I was going to this fancy tee today, and I was like, I need to wear my yeah, but I did think of her and she was able to, she doesn't try to look young or I don't even want to say, but it looks she always looks really modern. But yes, that bag that she did with Marc Jacobs in that collection, you know, they're on the real, real. I know, but you know my life. You know, someday. That's the thing is that when I'm when I'm getting dressed for the day, I'm putting very different things in the bag than Sophia Coppola is ostensibly carrying around in York at this phase of her life. You know, it's like, I don't want the pouches, the baby food pouches to leak on it. Yes. So what, how do you think she's used this personal style? She's launched, she's done a lot of marketing things. So she did a lip balm that we both received as gifts for with Augustinus Potter, the great skincare line, right? She did a tinted lip balm. She's done a lot of, she did a collaboration with Berry, the cashmere mill that's owned by the company that owns Chanel. So, and Chanel is a supplier of Chanel. So she did this very, she did an amazing puffer that looked like the one she probably wears on set when she's directing and it's cold, but it was $8,000. So is that the puffer that she is wearing in the photo in front of the fake Graceland gates? My guess is that that is what the puffer that Berry sold was inspired by. But we still haven't ID'd that puffer. No. Okay. That's, if anyone listening can help me out. Yeah. What was the puffer that Sophia Coppola was wearing in front of the Graceland gates? It's a photo that it's in her book, but it was used for a lot of Priscilla Press. It's on her Instagram and she's in the, in front of the gates that they made for Graceland. I love a boots ID too, but the code is really what I'm searching for. I think there's someone listening who will be able to help with this. So do you think she's part laid that into her, into being able to do, I mean, I don't know if she would be a person who would be asked to do a big budget movie because her work is so particular, but a lot of her peers have been asked to do giant movies and get the big paycheck. Do you think that because she's not being asked to do that, so she doesn't want to, she uses all these brand partnerships as a way to sort of allow for her, I mean, her husband, they make money. Yes. No, she talks about that. And she's like, I learned this from my father, who very famously, who's had many financial ups and downs. That's a whole other podcast series, but ultimately started a successful wine business and then sold off the wine business to fund his last, I think, film, Megalopolis, which I saw in theaters. And that's, I'll leave it there. But she says, yeah, that you, as I learned this from my dad, that you do other stuff to fund the art that you want to make so you can make it on your own terms. And I don't think that she wants to do a giant, you know, I don't think she wants to make Barbie. She gave some interview about Barbie and it was like really, really classic Sophia, where she was like, it was cool to see all the colors and how excited people were or something. That's not an exact quote, but that was the sentiment. And she's, you know, she's so wonderful at saying so much with some Sophie words. I genuinely, I mean, I really admire her for it. I don't think she wants to make a Barbie. She was in development for a TV adaptation of an Edith Wharton novel, Custom of the Country, which would have been wonderful. But she said it ultimately just didn't work out, a combo of like budget and production constraints and just that she was not going to be able to make it in the way that she wanted to make it. And it was really stressing her out. So, yeah, I think that she, you know, works with Berry or works, you know, does all of her spawn con, which I say with love and affection, and I buy most of it. I can't afford the Berry stuff, but that's okay. You know, God is even too far for me as someone who spends too much on clothes. I was like, I can't buy any. I looked at the price sheet and I was like, well, close tap. Yeah. In order to be able to keep making the movies that she wants to make the way she wants to make them. Yeah. My dream would be for her to do the Victoria's Secret book that Shantel and I wrote. But I think it would be so great. You know, that is probably contemporaneous with bling ring. I, the aesthetic is too close to bling ring. And also, and I would say that was the one where that was the most uncomfortable for her. It's my least favorite of her films. I really appreciate like all the the sleigh bells, song cues, you know, obviously she uses music so beautifully. But she shot that on digital. And I think she even talks about kind of like, this was weird and this was not my comfort zone. And that the covetousness implied in all of that film is, I think, an interesting topic for her. But it's like, she doesn't really, she filmed in Paris Hilton's home. And that was very cool. But like, that is not her aesthetic ideal, you know. So, and I don't know that Victoria's Secret is either. But she would be great at it. But no, it's fine. I'm moving on. So, what, what do you see if she's what like, let's be generous and say she's halfway through her career, maybe two thirds. Yeah. What do you think she'll do next? Because she has been doing more of these sort of projects. Also, do you think she has a cut of the Sophia Wine? I, I don't know, actually, because I remember when her father, whose full name we should say, Francis Ford Coppola, a legend of the screen. And an NOine maker. An NOine maker. But when he was speaking about just spending all his money on megalopolis, which he did, I think he spent upwards of $100 million. And by the way, he was in his 80s. He is in his 80s. So, Sophia may just be halfway done as well. But I think he said something to the effect of like, my kids won't need any more money. You know, what am I going to do with this money? Like, why wouldn't I spend it on my art? Because everyone else is okay. So, that doesn't imply a direct ownership or, you know, a cut of the Sophia Wine. But, but maybe, maybe her name's on it, I guess. Yeah. And if she was getting a cut of it, it wouldn't be in his bank. Right. So. But you know, they have hotels. They have all sorts of stuff. I'm sure she does like a lot of consulting that we don't even know about. And then her husband is a very successful musician, I think probably still from a time when CDs were sold. And obviously, he just did 20 minutes at the closing ceremonies of the Olympics, which like was a little surprising to me, but I enjoyed it. Yeah. I wonder what he got paid for that. Probably, probably actually not that much, but but touring still, I know nothing about the music industry, but touring is still valuable, right? You still make a lot of money off of that. Yeah. I think so. I mean, I don't know how much money Phoenix is making, but, but the prominence of Phoenix at the French closing ceremonies did suggest to me that like, they are very big in France, you know? Oh, yeah. So that's like, that's what France asked for that. Yeah. Big in France. So I'm sure they're doing fine. So to close, what are, let's have like a fun round of what are some of the most iconic images of Sophia that you, like the images you think are iconic, the ones that you reference again and again and again. Okay. I made a whole list. We obviously, we started with the first one. We referenced the photo of her in front of the gates of at Graceland or fake Graceland. And I literally just wrote in my notes, did we ever ID that jacket because I've been on the hunt for that puffer for two years. So maybe this podcast will bring some resolution. I'm excited. I'm putting, we also talked about street style, but really all of the photos of her in either a Charvet shirt or a striped sweater and jeans and a bag doing her business around town. Very important to me. Okay. There's a photo from, I believe it's the 2010 Venice Film Festival, where she's wearing formal shorts, glamour shorts, if you will, and a shirt tucked into it. I think it's all Louis Vuitton. And I haven't yet found the shorts or the shoes or the heels that will help me to pull off this look or the occasion, frankly, but it's something I aspire to. Oh my God, I remember this. Yeah. Of course you do. It's like, it works for her and I think it would work for me if, yes, for the right occasion, like not, you know, for mom's night out or whatever. But I think it could work for mom's night out. I feel like we really need to go for it. We're going to the smokehouse this week. Okay. We're going to the smokehouse, but I don't think this is smokehouse appropriate. You know, it's polo bar appropriate though. And I have shorts like this from La Mer. Right. So we can discuss that at a later date, but that one is very important to me. Yeah. Make this work. The photo of her directing Virgin Suicides in the red dress and the slides, iconic. And she says now that, you know, now she prefers to wear pants and a shirt. And she's like, I wouldn't wear slides when I was directing, but I think she's, she's incredibly young and glamorous and draped over the camera in a, in a red, I can't tell if it's sequins or lace. Can you tell? No. Anyway, she looks great and it's, it's just very cool. And there are like, there are a bunch of those as well. The one of her like holding the Canada Sophia wine and video village, I think, Marie Antoinette. All of the backstage photos are cool, but that one's great. One more. What else? Oh, no, I have two more. Okay. Uh, photos, paparazzi photos. I'm sorry for invading your privacy, Sophia Coppola, but paparazzi photos of her actual wedding to Thomas Mars. I legitimately, I held that photo up on our, on my phone to our friend Kate Schlichter, Kate of Lost Hills. And I said the haircut before my wedding, this is what I want my hair to look like for my wedding. And then bless her, Kate, she did it. Cause she is a genius. Kate is really good. She's really, really good. So that one was a lot of the important. I also kind of had a, I had a Rachel Comey dress that was like not unlike that dress. It's, she looks great. That is also one of mine. It's an Eliad dress. And there's also randomly a Oula Johnson dress. It is, it is a similar color. It's like a lavender, like really light purple. It's, and it's funny. I didn't buy it cause it's floral and I never wear flowers, but it came up. It's on, it's on the outnet right now. I was like, oh, should I get it? But it is, that dress is, it's, it's so beautiful. It is like a sheer lavender. It's, it's truly incredible. Fantastic. Then there's just the one of young Sophia with this, with Keanu Reeves and the super long hair and the red loafers. That really special stuff. And also like a nice reminder that it's okay if you can get everything right as a, as a young person, cause you still look cool, even if your hair was a little too long. And you were still dating Keanu Reeves and, and wearing all black and red loafers. So it's, it, they're all important. Yes. Yes. I would say, I would add there's a picture of her, I want to say dancing on a table wearing a white shift dress. It was probably 1994 or something. That dress was, it's still something I'm like chasing, finding like a cute little white mom dress. Right, right, right. And there is a couple times where she wore, like things she's worn on the red carpet. I feel like once I saw her and Francis Ford Coppola having dinner at Odeon and she was wearing Anna Swee, who is her good friend, her and Mark Jacobs and Anna Swee are all great friends. Anna Swee is so cool. And I think it was just Mark Jacobs' birthday, but maybe also Anna Swee's, I don't know. They're all like wishing each other happy birthday on Instagram, which is super fun. But she was wearing like a sparkly jacket by Anna Swee. And it was, I mean, it was just magical to go to dinner at the Odeon and see them. Right. Like just having dinner and the walking out. And I was like, I already didn't live in New York and I still don't want to live here. But yeah, it's really special. And I feel like I have things like that. I saw her once at a restaurant in Brooklyn wearing a striped shirt and skinny jeans and ballet flats in 2012 or whatever. And it's the same kind of thing where you're just like, oh, this person is just living in the world. And if I saw her, I think she's such a chic woman, but she is, there is just something like very close. It feels very close. Even though she lives this rarefied world, she's also a person who you feel like you know and would be friends with or whatever. And that is what, to me, makes her like such an interesting creative. She doesn't feel untouchable, even though everything she does is very untouchable in some ways. Yes. She, I just want her recommendations for everything. You know, I want her index, I want her opinion. She has impeccable taste. She just does, right? That's it. It's kind of one of the most perfect exhibitions of taste or taste that is closest to mine and what I think is sophisticated tastes that I've ever seen. And you see it in the movies and what she picks to be in her films and who she picks and the music. I mean, she really is, she's a filmmaker, but a lot of it is curating the perfect scene of everything that you want. And then she's just the coolest person in her regular life. I mean, honestly, even having your daughter go on TikTok and be like, sorry, I have to make a perfect TikTok about how I got grounded for like trying to rent a helicopter to go to dinner with my camp friend. That's elite stuff. You know, I love this girl. She's really good. She was very good on the one episode of the English teacher that I saw that she was on. That's a funny show. Yeah. She is, she's definitely winning in that generation of, I don't even want to use the word, but young people who have famous parents. Yeah. She's doing the most with it. She released a couple singles, you know, just for the hell of it. Why not try? She was in megalopolis. She went to Cannes with her grandfather. Go to Cannes with your grandfather if you have the opportunity, you know? Yeah. You know, it's funny. I'm looking through all these images of Sophia Coppola and they're all perfect. There's not one where I'm like, oh, that's the one. And that to me is what makes her so special is that like, maybe she's not putting a lot of effort in, but it's always right. She always hits it. And that is, it's very inspiring and not in a in a way, you know, it's funny. She was on the cover of this indie magazine, Polyester, and she's wearing a Coke, the real thing vintage. And of course, I look for it for hours and you couldn't find it anywhere. But she just always nails it. And that is the thing that, and even if you don't like her movies and you can't connect with them for whatever reason, there is, you just have to respect the ability to like have an idea. So many people, and I don't know how you feel when you're, you have to watch hundreds of movies, what, every month? And for the big picture, but also jam session, like you're, you need to understand what's happening in the culture. And in the same way, I have to look at a lot of different clothes. And most of what I look at is it doesn't have a point of view. Right. It's just sort of floating in the ether. And what she does and why I think she connects with so well with the fashion industry, but any like creative force that's working today, you have to have a strong vision and she, she just does like there's no way around it. Yeah. Bill Murray said that he started calling her the velvet hammer because on, on set, I think on Lost in Translation because it's very polite, you know, as, as we've discussed, she, she is very open, but it's also, she doesn't use a thousand words when 20 will do. And, but, and, and she doesn't want to ruffle anyone's feathers, but she knew exactly what she wanted and she would get it every single time. And, you know, if someone else had an idea, like, oh, sure, but can we just, can we try this first because she really, she has, she sees everything and knows exactly what she wants. And I think that's what makes her a great filmmaker and also, you know, an inspiration to me on a daily basis. We see Sophia. We do. She sees everything and we see her. We really do. I hope she enjoys this love letter, not that she's going to listen to it, but I mean, I hope she's never going to a podcast in her life, honestly. I think she has. I think she has. You never, bless her. You never see her wearing AirPods, you know, which is good. That's another thing that I know is not cool because of Sophia. Yeah, that's actually true. I don't know. I think she dips in or at least gets a summary. Okay. Well, if anyone's giving her a summary, tell her great work and that this wasn't creepy at all. This is my job as being creepy. Amanda. We're very normal people. We're very normal. Thank you for being here. Thank you for joining me on Fashion People. I hope we can do it again soon. Thank you for having me as a blast.
