Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Pucks Fashion and Beauty Memo Line Sheet. And today with me on the show is designer Scott Sternberg. We're talking best and worst dressed at the Cannes Film Festival. Pierre Paolo at Balenciaga, turning around Burberry. And sweatpants. Happy Tuesday everyone. I hope to see you tonight for Pucks Stories of the Season Emmys event in Hollywood. I am going to be interviewing Parker Posey. I probably will not get a party girl reference in there. I apologize, I'm going to try. Matt Bellany, our author of What I'm Hearing and the host of The Town, the Great Ringer podcast. And he is also the chief architect of this whole thing. He is interviewing John Mulaney for a live recording of The Town. So if you, I hope I see you or you, I guess you'll listen to it later. Anyway, this week on Line Sheet you can read more about Pierre Paolo Picolli's appointment at Balenciaga. I'm really trying people. A preview of Chanel's latest financial report, which is being announced this week. It's the 2024 numbers. My best dressed take from Cannes Film Festival, which Scott and I are going to get into here, but I have something a little more in depth and a whole lot more. So let's just get going with Scott. I know that's what you want me to do. Scott Sternberg, welcome to Fashion People. Lauren Sherman, thank you. What's going on? I just got back from New York. So I'm a little groggy and jet laggy. I know that a mutual friend of ours saw you there. So I heard you were in New York. Yeah, we had a nice, nice dinner. I think you may, oh, it was someone else that you ran into. I don't know if you had had dinner with this person, but I think you may see this person at the puck stories of the season event tonight, which you are now on the hook to go to because I am mentioning it. I will be there. I don't know who you're talking about. You're being cryptic, but I'm excited to see that. Robert Chu. Oh, yeah. Great. You run into him? Yes. He'll be there. It's okay. He'll be excited that I mentioned him. Fantastic. I don't know who the mutual friend is, what we can discuss offline. Yeah. How was New York? Was it muggy and yucky and you wanted to get back? It was a rough week. I had a shoe in a day and I have a dog. I couldn't find anybody to watch him. And it was rainy and muggy. And I hate to sound like a whiner, but it was not New York's best moment for me to say the least. The best New York is when the weather is bad because it reminds you why you don't live there. Oh, yeah. I mean, listen, and then the flight back is great because you're home, but I'm going back in less than a week. So. Me too. Oh, nice. Yeah. I'll see you there. We are having another event there that I think you were not overlapping, but I'll give you the details offline. It'll be fun. So we are here to talk today. This is a big news day in fashion. On Monday morning, the announcement that was kind of brewing for the past week, people sort of knew that Pierre Palot, Pitchie Oli, is that how you've written? I need to find out how to pronounce it actually. Pitchie Oli. I don't know. Pitchie Oli is the new creative director of Balenciaga. This was something that had sort of been brewing, and I heard something early last week, then it started to seep onto the internet rumor mills. And by the end of last week, it seemed pretty sure that he was, from what I know, this was not something, this is the last couple of months, this decision was made. It wasn't something that happened prior to Demna being announced at Gucci. So it's not like he's been waiting in the wings, which is interesting. And I have a lot more on inline sheet on Monday, and probably we'll do a little follow up on Tuesdays, depending on what happens. But what's your initial reaction to this? Listen, I think he's, he's wonderful. He's fantastic. He has great taste. He has a clear point of view. I love what he did at Valentino, especially after Maria Grazia left. It became so laser sharp. I think the meh is more of zooming out like the overall effect of all this movement at the same time. I don't think is a very good look for all these big global businesses and brands. To me, it just makes them all feel very vulnerable and too similar. You start to question like, what really are these houses about? If these codes are just floating between them freely all the time? But I just quickly scan Vanessa's piece in the times and she made some good points. I mean, you know, he's talented. Let's see. It's just the whole picture of it is a little, is a little odd to me. Yeah. I won't be reading Vanessa's piece until mine is published because I don't like to be, I don't like to get other people in my head. But the thing, this is what I use the word gentle, because it's like, this is the end of this. And this, this designer musical chairs thing, as you know, this happens every decade or so. It feels more pronounced now because there are more brands, there's more money and it's much more the information's more instantaneous. So we process it more quickly. But this was sort of a very gentle end to that, this round of chairs. There's obviously Fendi is still open, but that doesn't really, and it's interesting that he was very much top of mind for Fendi up until probably late last year. So I think he is, you know, he's a couturier, he's an incredible dressmaker. I've been to his couture shows, which is, I haven't been to that many and I feel really lucky. He's, he is truly a remarkable designer. And I think you're right about taste. One thing I was talking about with an executive over at Caring is that he is actually very good at image as well, which is something that is, it's not missing at Balenciaga, but it, he'll be able to create a new visual identity pretty quickly. And also, I mean, the biggest thing to me is that his clientele will come with him from Valentino, even if they are still buying Valentino, they will come to Balenciaga. I think that you're right though, in that this isn't something it's not going to move the markets. And maybe it wouldn't have any way because Balenciaga is like an under $2 billion dollar in your business, but it's not, it doesn't feel like the future. Like Jonathan Anderson and Matu Blase feel like the future. And if they do well, it could mean something big. But if, if it, right now it still feels like, is the industry in a sort of pattern? And is it there's going to be movement at the end of this year and move into a new phase? Or is the industry starting to like enter its decline? And that's the question for me. Yeah, listen, it's cyclical. So it's probably on that arc of the circle, right, which is going down. Because that's, it's necessary. There has to be some sort of correction. It's been kind of obscene, just how much fashion is part of culture. And it doesn't necessarily equate with what the output is, right? I think both of us probably get more excited about idea driven designers, where the ideas aren't as much about clothes necessarily, but about clothes and where they fit in society now. So like Mewcha and Jonathan Anderson and Demna. And to some extent, Matu, but he's sort of in the middle to me. He's really a materials, asthe artisanal sort of guy like Peter. Raph is more of the idea guy. But it's interesting to go for Balenciaga, which was an idea driven brand kind of by off of that a meme kind of driven brand and really a luxury merch business, I would guess, to whatever this is going to sort of trickle down into in terms of the ideas that beer polo is putting out there. It will certainly be beautiful. The couture will certainly be, you know, stunning. And I love all that. I think that's great. And maybe all those ideas will, Demna darkness will translate over to Gucci, but I have a feeling he'll pull the rug out from under us and surprise us all. Because that's part of his playbook. But, you know, all the best. It's just the overall effect is it may be on the cynic, you know, I'm in it, we're in it. But the overall effect is a little bit of a bummer to me somehow. It's not so exciting. Like I would have liked to see the junior or Mark, you know, like somebody really who like junior especially really a thinker in there, if you're going to go, I don't know, go somewhere or or June Takahashi or or Chitose Abe, you know, yes, June would be a mate. Yeah. That's one that I've never understood why he hasn't. But maybe I do think there's something to not wanting it. And some some people coming from a culture that like very I don't know of any of those Japanese designers who have taken one of those jobs. Kenzo. Kenzo, yes. Well, Kenzo was Kenzo, right? It was Kenzo. That's right. Yeah. He's so sorry. Yeah, it's a good I mean, it's a it was in he was in the system at least. Parisian brand. Yeah, different thing, different time. But yeah, I think it's all look, I think one of the big things is that Valentino was most successful when there was a really robust accessories program supporting Pierre Palo and and Maria Grazia when they were together. She's a great accessories designer. I think what Valencia Aga has done the last two years in the CEO, the deputy CEO, the woman Natalie, not Natalie, Ren. I'm just not rashing and burning. I'm not trying. It was just named deputy CEO. She's she's the chief merchant. She's created this accessories program around Demna that feels of Demna but is separate. And I think if they're able to sort of manage that around him and manage the the menswear part is the piece that I think is challenging because he was I don't know. I have no insight into whether or not Valentino menswear performed very well. I bet suiting was did okay. But I don't think that's his strong suit. He did some amazing actually, he did some amazing collaborations with undercover for men's that were awesome. But I think generally the the market the critical response to the menswear wasn't as as strong and it's a big menswear business. So I think that's that's going to be a challenge. And yeah, I think look, I thought Peter Mueller would be great because I love him and I think he's interesting and I am a consumer of his clothing. So I was excited for that. But that said, he's great where he's at. What a good match. You know, like this idea of people staying somewhere for a long time to me is kind of radical and refreshing. Yes. And to your other point, listen, I think a lot of the job of this working can't all be on a creative director or in a bunch of design jobs. It's really a merchandising exercise and extrapolating a set of ideas. And this isn't cynical. But I think part of it, whether it's from a design perspective or a kind of culture driven perspective, the creative director's job is to kind of create a whirlwind of something we all want to be a part of, right? Like, and even me who's a cynic at this point, like, I wanted some Matthew Bottega something, I needed something, right? I needed when Bodhi first came out, I needed to get a little bit of that. I want to be a part of it. And I think that's really the job in the first, you know, year. And who knows? I mean, he's great. He can, he can do it. Go Pierpallo. Go Pierpallo. Congrats. I'm happy for him. Each spring, 23 Pulitzer Prizes are awarded for Distinguished Journalism, Books, Drama, and Music. There was disbelief and pride and life changing.

So moving on to another brand that seems to be keeping its creative director, Daniel Lee at Burberry. The CEO, Joshua Schulman, did an interview at WWD where I don't know if he said he's staying. I didn't see that in quotes, but that was the headline. He's staying. I went to this event, which was, the event was very interesting at Flamingo estate on Friday night. They had a dinner, I think at the store somewhere with like really fancy people afterwards, but there was a casual event with Burberry at Flamingo estate, but it was for their collaboration with High Grove, which is the summer house estate of Charles and Camilla. The reason I need to tell you about this is, A, I mean, you've been to Flamingo estate a million times. It's so beautiful. And I had a really nice time. Was it a Flamingo event or a Flamingo, Richard just rented on his house. It was connected to Flamingo. The gift was a Burberry Flamingo estate box, essentially with a Flamingo estate charcoal soap that says Burberry. Because I handed it to my husband and I said, do you want this or should we give it to someone? And he took it and now it's in our shower and I was like, what? Oh, fine. And then some honey that is flavored rose. So I won't be partaking in it, but that was specific for Burberry. And then the book, the Flamingo estate book. So and Richard was there and the person that he gets to cook a lot who I have a mutual friend with who's apparently amazing was there. Like they had amazing stuff. It was a really lovely, lovely event. And the funniest part of it that someone mentioned to me is that it's like King Charles's estate and then Meghan Markle had all that stuff with Flamingo estate and all this. Everyone who thinks that there was some sort of conspiracy behind this, I don't think that High Grove had any idea about many of this guys. It was just Burberry being like, it's a garden. It sounds lovely. But the thing that was interesting to me and what I want to know from you as a designer and a product guy and a creative director, everyone was dressed in Burberry. They were gifted, a lot of people are gifted, the collection is really beautiful. It's like painterly, you can get a trench with like a painterly silk lining. That type of stuff. I'm looking at it right now. Yes. It's cute. But the other thing was they just had everyone in Burberry. And my whole thing is that I think what Josh Shulman should be focusing on is make everybody think they need a trench in the same way everybody thinks they need a Montclair puffer. And the Burberry trench in some ways is even more versatile because you can wear one in all different weather. And also it's just like a classic thing. And if you're not going to buy it full price from them, buy a vintage one. And I don't know. I love them. But what is your opinion about like what should happen with Burberry and how they should approach this? Because they are, like the market is responding favorably to everything. Right now he's in cost cutting mode, but they had one of the little anecdotes in the earnings report was that the, they had double digit increases for like wholesale interest in the collection, that type of thing. So they are turning a corner. Whether or not that will be like a year long corner or a five year long corner is another question. But what do you think Burberry should be? Yeah, it's so loaded. I think, listen, I think they have a set of franchises that other houses would be envious of, right? But how to kind of infuse those with some energy and infuse that energy into the larger culture, that's a real tough thing. You can't totally control the cultural dialogue. It's sort of like surfing a wave, right? And what I haven't, what I've seen from Burberry is some great vibes on their social channels, right? They're picking up some British humor and the visuals look good and the feeling is modern, right? But I think what you said about the trends, yes, sure, but that's a long lead one. That's not something you do with a few product placements in a phone call. That's like TV and film and that's gonna take time to kind of seep in. I think to me, the biggest challenge is their house check is so played out and it's a big franchise, but I see it everywhere all over their site and it doesn't feel appealing, it feels played out. And maybe this is my age again, but I see Burberry London and it should have one less zero on the price point. It's really hard for me to see a $700 Bikini in a tan house check from Burberry. It's a merchandising issue. It's not hard for me to see a collaboration that's super craft driven and artisanal that did a play on that check that was all made by hand and it was $10,000 or something, but I don't think that franchise is being handled correctly personally. And even from a trench perspective, they're quite expensive. I don't see the kind of entry level. So it's hard for me to totally fully accept Burberry at the price point that it's at. That would be my first comment. You know, just based on the heritage and history of the house, at least in the last 40 years. But that being said, and I think, you know, as a fashion brand, it's always a little odd. I think Christopher Bailey nailed it and you didn't realize he was nailing it at the time, but it just felt right and he was really, well, because it wasn't like everybody was wearing it. That's the thing, right? But at least in the States. Becky Malinsky claims that people were wearing the dresses. Maybe. I don't know. The men's shows were so good. And I had a prorsem bag. I got a Barney's, you know, I wanted to do good because I wanted to be part of it. Like it's the same thing where you want to be part of it and it's well, merchandise on the business side. So enough of us have things that we can buy to be part of it and it drives the business. But what he was doing was what, at least at the time, the playbook was great. There was a different distinct narrative every season that could play out across a global network of stores and wholesale partners and it kept things going and sold all those franchises. And, you know, I think Daniel Lee is amazing. What he did at Bottega was like incredible, that vibe shift, that tonal shift. I don't quite, I'm not quite seeing it. Like at the Met, it felt heavy and plotting and not modern. And I didn't know what all that velvet stuff was. And it also felt too like everybody was like matchy. And I just didn't get it. It felt like somebody was trying to make Burberry happen too hard. So, you know, I actually think it's a product thing. I just trolled the site this morning because you told me we were talking about it. And I just don't see a lot of stuff. I don't know who's buying this stuff at that price point. The wit I'm seeing in the content, I'm not seeing in the small accessories. It's not quite come together. It just feels too serious or something. I don't know. To a steer. Yeah. I think that the check, the tartan or whatever, it's a really good point because I want everybody to want a Burberry trench. And there was a check that they did that was a little different that I linked to in Mondays of a trench that I thought was really beautiful. But yeah, I think the other thing is that a lot of people are going to come through second hand for this, which is fine. But the only way that's fine is if you have a product at full price that is also desirable. So maybe the customer first buys a trench on Etsy that's probably fake or something to get into it and then trades up. And that part of it, if you don't, you're right. And also if they had a trench that was, I think $1,100 at this point would be, if that was what it was, that's actually, people would buy that. But it's when you start to get into, I think everybody right now is just like, oh my God, it's, everything is $4,000 that is designer. And if you are buying that stuff, a friend of mine wanted to buy a Mew Mew dress that was cotton. It's $4,000. It's bonkers. It's a tiny little, and it's sold out. I mean, they probably just had one of each, or two of each, but it's sold out. She couldn't even buy it. Because I was like, if you can get it for, I guess if you can get it for $2,300 and you're going to wear it every day this summer, it's okay. But it's getting nuts. This is what's happens to our brains. No, it's pretty, it's pretty silly. And listen, I think Burberry, at the high end with the right level of craft or artistry or collaboration or whatever, can command super high prices. But a trench is, for better or worse, somewhat of a commodity, culturally and from a merchandising perspective at this point, it's not something they can own anymore as their own. Or if they're going to own it, they need to wildly reinterpret it at the high end in much more exciting ways like Montclair does. I mean, the Genius program, still I think about some of those things. But Pierre Paolo, when he did that, that was sick. So good. And the presentation of it was so good. And it was, it stuck. So I think that's where the job is. And so when I see shows or I see Brad carpet, it's like, I don't even think you should be playing in that field as much. Like they're, play with these, play with the iconography and the franchises outside of the traditional fashion and kind of celebrity, mediums, platforms and come at it from the outside even more. I think that would be my marketing approach, Elise. Yeah. The thing that I keep thinking with Daniel Lee is, give it one more season because I did think this past collection was much improved in terms of, it felt like it gave me a sense of the Christopher Bailey era. It looked like it was designed for Anna Wintour, which, you know, and fine. But I think the thing that I keep going back to is, I don't know who Daniel Lee is. I know what that botega was, which was so sharp that I bought, it ended up becoming too trendy for me, but I bought something from the pre-collection that was, I ended, I actually just sold it. It was this great collar before everybody was making those collarless jackets. I saw that blazer. I made you try that on for me. That blazer's good. I sold it. It was too stiff. I never wore it. But what he did, it was very clear. And that was probably a mix of him and the team, but it was so clear. Ultimately, yeah. There was this sort of bougie 70s, early 80s Italian lady walking to, you know, get her nails done vibe. It was cool and weird and obtuse and specific. The Burberry stuff now, I don't know. I just don't, again, he's super talented, but it doesn't feel of the moment. I don't know. And I don't know what moment it's going for. Yeah, exactly.

I was actually, when I first heard that they were making the dress code even stricter, allowing no nudity and no long trains, I was actually like secretly kind of liked it because I just, I'm like give them, give people a box, give people restraints. But what I will say is it's been a kind of a, other than Rooney, Mara and Joaquin Phoenix. How good. I can't handle it. I mean, how good. My girl Rooney. She looked amazing. But he also looked, I agree. What happened? He suddenly is like a top 10 in terms of attractive Hollywood actors. First of all, his weight was going back and forth for roles he was taking. So he was like, you know, for the Joker, he was, well for the Joker, he was like nothing. And then he was getting pudgy for some, for those afraid. So I think he's found his happy body medium. But no, he looks great. He's attractive. And I think the two of them together, they're so into each other, they're electric. You can feel it. There was like a photo of them walking. And I was like, I know. I know. And then I tried to look it up and you couldn't find it forever. And I was just like, I don't understand. They are seriously my number one couple now. I can't take it. I know. I think about Rooney is like, she always gets photographed looking so serious and like daggers at the camera. She's actually quite a smiley sweet person. And when you see those off photos, like you're talking about where she's just beaming with Joaquin, you really get a sense of her. The clothes even look better. But yeah, no, she was, she was top five for me for sure. I'm so into it. She was wearing white Givenchy. He was wearing a Givenchy tux really quickly. Can we talk about how, how can more men wear clothes that fit them? Because it's a huge epidemic of like pants not fitting and jackets not fitting. As someone, you're a menswear designer by trade. How do you, and also you fit a lot of, when you were doing Band of Outsiders, you were dressing a lot of guys who short, tall, whatever, not like mostly shorter guys, but like guys who weren't, it's not Joaquin Phoenix at this moment in time. Like anything is going to fit that guy at this point. I don't know what happened. It's very, I'm very taken aback by it. But generally, what are some rules for people? Listen, it's really challenging. With Band, it worked from a celebrity dressing perspective. The severity of the silhouette and fit sort of created a box around who would come to us for clothes. And generally, you know, we would really only work with who it makes sense to work with. You know, Tom Brown, sometimes it goes the other way and it looks completely ridiculous on the wrong guy. Yeah. And sometimes it looks really hot. But it's tough. You know, you, you, you think men stressing is so simple, but proportions are everything. And especially if a guy has a longer, short torso, it really starts to get confusing. And anything off the rack has to really be rethought like where a jacket breaks on a guy with a short torso could really make or break that, that kind of look. It's, it's just all about, it's all about tailoring and silhouette. And as that men's fashion has gotten more fashioned with a capital F, it's like even harder, right? Because there's just, there's, there's big ideas out there for guys. You know, get a good tailor on site and, you know, don't try to wear a sample off the rack. That's my, that's my suggestion. I think everyone should talk to Seth Rogen because he, his clothes always fit. On the studio, they look amazing and the costume designer is making, it's mostly custom. But I think he works with Wendy and Nicole, the stylist, he always looks great. And he's not like, he's, he's just a dude. His clothes fit him. Yeah. And he looks, he looks good. It's not boring. Yeah. But he's also like not going, he's, he's just, listen, he's going, they understand his personality or he knows how to say no. You know, when it starts to be this mismatch between the two is when it gets cringy and it really does get cringy. So anything it can that you really loved or really hated. Okay. I, I love Jennifer Lawrence in that kind of plizé dior. Same. Kind of, when, you know, when she pulls that hair back and that little sheen yawn and has a red lip, like kind of that Oscars moment, she looks perfect. Conversely, she looked like, you know, Dorothy Spornack on the Levis with the golden girls in the soft look with the skirt for the press thing. Like it was like shocking, right? So that was a good sort of do's and don'ts moment. Isabelle Uper is always like tops. I can't, like she's the, she's the one. In the green Balenciaga. Yeah. Yeah. There was a couple other things. Incredible. And she's always somehow, she's completely covered up, but she looks, and she's not young, and she looks so sexy and sick every time. And you know, I want to get poor Emma Stone out of that Fuiton contract. It's so depressing. Jesus Christ. This one was it, there's no excuse. Because the thing I will say is that the Fuiton stuff has gotten a little, I think has improved dramatically over the past three or four years where, where there are some beautiful things. And, and there are, Jennifer Connolly could have probably worn that dress and looked cool. I, I mean, I'm being generous, but I thought that that mint green dress that Emma Stone wore that broke for the Oscars, I like that. I can handle it. But that wasn't very even house coded though. That could have been from five different houses. And that whole, there's that whole world of stuff. It's, it's more Balenciaga actually. It's, it's part of the, it's part of the red carpet rotation. And that's fine. But it's very, it's the Fuiton red carbous of overall. Emma Stone back in the day, Michelle Williams was sort of caught in that loop. I'm sure it's a big check that's hard to say no to, but it's weird to me because on the house end, it's, there's not really brand codes that are being kind of, you're cultivated or fostered. And on the side of the celebrity, it just feels like a miss. It's like, I want, I want more for you, Emma Stone. You're so cute. And your hair looks really good right now. Like go somewhere else, go other, also you just feel like a billboard. And if we get it, get it, get your money. But like, I don't know. Well, it's a challenge because I don't think Nicola, I guess, care. He obviously engages and cares. He has these deep relationships with certain people. And I think when he has the, when, when it's the right person, it can kind of work. But it's also kind of comes back to like, what are these houses for? And what should they focus on? I think Balenciaga has actually done a really incredible job in the last two years of doing traditional red carpet, but somehow, and the, the construction, you can just tell us so good, but somehow twisting it just a little bit. That it doesn't feel totally separate from what Demna does. And I don't think, I think the Vuitton has gotten better. And you're right. The stuff that I think is better, like what a lot of the stuff the Heim sisters have been wearing more recently is not of Nicola, I guess, scare. Like, it feels separate. And so, and it was interesting, Cynthia Reville wore Givenchy. She used to be, I have a Vuitton contract to the Met and she looked incredible. And she actually had pulled off a lot of the Vuitton stuff. I mean, she just looks amazing. She works with Jason Bolden. I think they have a really good relationship. She just kills it. But I do think it comes back to this idea of like, what should it be? And it's interesting. I think Celine does a very good job at the, this is, I mean, this is such a backhanded compliment, but of the generic red carpet stuff. They had a Alexa Chung wore this Celine dress that I was like, if I was going to do some, if I did something like this, it's what I would want to wear. Yeah, no, in this, listen, even the ready to wear in the store, it's the same thing where it's exactly how that you want that vintage piece to be reinterpreted. And it's really so good. What I miss is, and this is not nostalgia, this is just something I always loved about fashion, is that relationship between a designer, Givenchy and an actor, artist, you know, Audrey Hepburn, whatever it is, and there's more modern examples of that, Albert and Natalie Portman or Emma Stone at the time, like they really felt like, or McKelley has this with his women, like it really felt like there was a dialogue and a real kind of alchemy of ideas and body and, you know, design coming together. And a lot of what this feels like is just sort of like, just like this like slapping on this rails of samples and just slapping stuff on it. Listen, this is not to insult the designers because there's good stuff or the stylists because they're working their butts off and they're doing great job. But there's something, there's just something missing from it. Yeah, it is so challenging to get at this stuff right. And so I will say Givenchy in the early Sarah Burton era has really nailed it. I thought Diane Kruger, it was interesting seeing the runway look on someone. I thought she looked fun. Which one was that? She wore the like yellow blazer dress with the big bow. It was cold. Yeah, it was fun. She can do that. She's cold, I might. Yeah. I just think she's nailed it. Like she is, it is working on the red carpet. They're being very careful. They're picking the right people. And then they are also tailoring the stuff to fit and look good and all of that. But which is, it is just really hard to get it right. And especially at these bigger houses, I thought Dior this time, you totally nailed it with the Jennifer Lawrence thing that police say dress was incredible. And I thought she looked great. And then the casual thing, why? It didn't. So, but Dior, I thought Julia Bono, she wore this hooded pants with a hooded top. And it was, it looked, it was beautiful. And I also thought Natalie Portman's, it was very standard, but that little tiny thing. Yes. I mean, I thought she looked great. And it's hard when you're, when you're doing, they'll probably do a hundred, a hundred looks this film festival that never ends. It's like, no, totally. I mean, but that's also like, you know, that's why the whole effort starts to become, for the big houses, go for it. You know, Kate and Laura, Ebrodarte here in LA, working their ass off on all this red carpet stuff. I feel for them because they do these stunning pieces. And sometimes they just get completely diluted in the sea of stunning pieces. And the Givenchy stuff to your point, like that yellow concoction really stood out. I didn't, I didn't realize that was Givenchy. But Rooney looked good. At that folk world PR thing, Taylor Russell looks so good in that runway kind of blazer dress. It's really sick. Yeah. Okay. Moving on. I had one final question for you. The strategist did this, and of course, I thought of you. The strategist did this. So you had another brand called Entire World, which by the way, at my son's four year birthday party last week, and one of the moms, I had an Entire World shirt on. It was one with a stamp. It was the black shirt with white buttons and it has the stamp. And she said, I still miss that brand. It is the LA millennial woman was very into Entire World. So you had the second brand that was Fast and Furious. And it was very well known, very known for its sweatsuits, sweatpants. And there was this amazing New York Times article by our friend Irene Alexander called sweatpants forever. Everyone should read it. I linked to it in the newsletter on Monday. But to this past week, there was a strategist piece for this dude was like, I tried all these sweatpants. The best ones that I've tried were a pair of $40 sweatpants from Uniqlo. But then the other things were just, there were all these different ideas of which ones you should what, which ones you shouldn't. And it was very funny because last night, my husband was going through his clothes because I was like, you have too many clothes, you have to get rid of some. And he found some Entire World item that he had never worn. And I hear this a lot, like Rebecca Ramsey, our friend who's a stylist, she has a white sweatsuit that she's saving, that she hasn't touched. My question for you is, are there any sweatpants that you would, because you probably have a bunch and you probably have unlimited Entire World forever. But I do not. I wish I did. But I have enough sweatpants to be wearing and I have no clue. I could not tell you in the marketplace what, what to buy. I do have some stuff in the plastic. It's funny, I saw Jenny Slade at Irina's kid's first birthday a couple weeks ago. And she was like, I still have like five camisoles and matching underwear sets in the plastic. My neighbor Luke at Silvertop has Band of Alciders polo shirts still in the plastic, which warms the cockles of my heart. But the last thing I want to look at or comp shot for right now, Lauren Sherman, is sweatpants. What makes a good sweatpants? Hmm. I mean, on my approach to Entire World, we started with this fabric we developed in Japan and it was just, just sublime fabric that took color really well because it's all about color. So then you kind of get a silhouette that drapes off of that. Ours were tapered at the bottom because it was kind of light and drapey. It depends what you're doing. A winter sweatpants and a spring summer sweatpants are completely different things. One's a fleece, one's a loopback terry. I, for overall the perfect like gray moral, like vintage Russell athletics kind of vibe, for Entire World we use, we started with Nicole's route, like vintage roots, women's or maybe they were men's that she wore that she was always wearing as a base and then sort of adjusted those for the fabric and kind of tweak them from there. So maybe roots. That's, that's Nicole Kerry. Yeah. Let's ask Nicole or go to Canada. I don't know if they're shipping in the US at the moment. Oh, God. It's Gus Sternberg. Thanks for being here.
