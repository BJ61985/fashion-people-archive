I'm Lauren Sherman, the writer behind Puck's fashion and beauty memo line sheet. And welcome to Fashion People, my twice weekly podcast where I take you behind the scenes of the fashion industry with the smartest and most interesting insiders. So, while Tuesdays are for news and notes, Fridays are going to be our deep dive days where we take on one important topic that everyone is talking about. Today I have with me superstar buying exec, Elizabeth Von der Goldt, who's spent her career climbing the ranks at all the important luxury stores both online and off, from Barneys and Bergdorf Goodman to Netta Porte, Farfetch and Matches. She's worked everywhere. Our subject at hand. Why is fashion so darn expensive these days? You've seen the price tags, $16,000 for dresses that aren't couture, $11,000 handbags, $5,000 leather pants. It's starting to feel insane. Elizabeth has worked with pretty much every fashion brand on the planet and understands their pricing strategies better than anyone. So let's get started. Elizabeth, thank you so much for being here. It's so great to see you. I'm excited to be on your show too. So one thing we're going to do in this Friday episode is I don't even know if I need to set this one up. It's a small segment, but I'm very curious what you had for breakfast today. Okay. I actually don't really eat breakfast. I make myself a kale smoothie when I drink around 12 o'clock or one o'clock. So that's basically it. Or I have a probiotic first thing in the morning. I don't eat breakfast a lot either. Do you do intermittent fasting? I don't. I'm not hungry when I wake up. So my whole life I've been like that. When I'm on holiday, I'll eat breakfast, but it's like 12 o'clock. Okay. Well, you look great. So I'm not going to say that's why, but you look good. But I think it's funny because everybody says fashion people don't eat. So I'm going to ask. I eat a ton, but I eat. I mean, if you know anyone who knows me, I eat more than anyone you could possibly imagine. But I eat in different hours. And dinner for me is like a, it's like I never lived without dinner. Like I cannot have, so I always have lunch. I always snack and have dinner. Since I moved to LA, I cannot eat as much as I used to. Because I don't, some days I walk like 3000 steps and I'm like, Oh, I'm going to die. I only walked 3000 steps today. It's so bad. And I just try to have 12 hours between when I go to bed and when I wake up. But anyway, thank you for that. And you are calling us from London where you've lived for how long now? It's going to be seven years in July actually. So actually, much longer than I ever thought. Oh my God. Do you still love it? I do love it. I do love it. I do love it. There's a lot going on here now with this whole new dawn, non-dom. I don't know if you've heard about this, some new tax ruling that they're probably going to vote in April of 2025. No, can you really briefly explain it to me? Because I have a feeling a lot of our, our listeners have not heard of it. Well, a lot of people are talking about it here and a lot of people thinking about moving. So it's basically if you are non-UK residents, you've been able to have like a break, like there's a seven year like time where you don't have to pay tax on outside income. And going forward, they're going to get rid of that. And it's not, it's like income that you have outside, it's fully taxed in that country. And you can never, you never even have to bring it into the UK. But now they're actually fully taxing you on that. And in the new ruling, in the new law that passes, they possibly might even have a four year clawback is from what I've read, but no one's exactly sure yet. So it's a big deal. That's terrible. Anyway, so there's going to be a lot of people moving probably in the next two years. This is obviously another result of Brexit, I guess. Yes, yes. I think the whole VAT thing, the Brexit thing, it's not anywhere. Anyway, I love it here. Besides that, I lived in the UK for two years after university. And when I went back, I got so much money because I think I had been yes, yes. And I felt so rich. I got like $3,000 or so. I'm sure I spent it on clothes. It's fine. I just remember I was so excited because I had been paying taxes. I think you anyway, yeah, it's like 50 per minute. It's a lot here. Well, we are going to talk more about money today. So I wanted to have you on, first of all, I would love for you to just kind of explain what you do. And then we can discuss today's topic, which is the cost of luxury goods or the cost of clothing generally. But let's talk about your background and how you ended up in London and what you've done as a career because you have a very specific position in the industry. And it explains why I wanted to have you on to talk about this specific thing. Yeah, no, it goes way back. I mean, I've been in this industry now since 1996. So it's been a really long time. Actually, my first job was at Barneeds, New York, which is no longer interesting because I think the pattern of fashion and people who really like exciting jobs is that yes, it's constantly changing. And you'll see a lot of the businesses I work for are no longer in business, which is same interesting as well. Yes. But actually, this particular podcast on pricing and everything is interesting, because my first job was actually the private label assistant buyer of Barneeds. So I actually did the spreadsheet that worked on exactly the fabrics, the meters, the duties and taxes on what kind of fabric that was like how much and we built the cost of actually the each garment. So that was sort of how I started. And for the uninitiated, private label is when a store makes a clothing line and puts their label on it to sort of fill in for stuff that other brands maybe don't make. And it's a higher margin. If you sell your own product, it's called direct to consumer, which we already talked about in the first episode of fashion people. But if you sell your own product, there's a you can make a bigger profit. And so a lot of times stores will make a private label that it'll say Barneeds or I can't even think of Sacks or whatever. And they'll sell cashmere sweaters under their name and they make more money on it. So you started as a buyer in that department. Exactly. Exactly. So it was a great place to start because you learn what goes into every single thing and what the costs actually are and where the fabric mills are. So it actually has been useful throughout my entire career. So then, you know, I've been a merchant forever. So in buying, I went to Bendles after to be the designer of buyer, which again is no longer Henry Bendle, no longer is featured in my book about Victoria's Secret that comes out October 8th, because it was owned by the same guy owned Victoria's Secret for a while. But it was an amazing department store. I think that store was a historic. Like it was a Tiffany windows where the Tiffany windows. So you worked there under there were cool. There was like a cool person there who's the fashion director, right? Or when I was there, it was actually we didn't have was like us. It was just our team. We didn't have a fashion director. It was like it was Ed Bristel, Stacy Bromfman, myself, Ed Bristel. That's the guy. I know. I mean, we bought Rick Owens. I mean, I remember going to Rick Owens's place in LA and like going to his apartment and picking clothes and we like launched that and in America. I mean, basically. So yeah. Anyway, from there, I actually spent the most of my career at Bergdorf Goodman. So by 16, 17 years at Bergdorf's and always, you know, I was there throughout mostly running the big brands like Chanel and Dior and etc. But it eventually overseeing beauty home and all of it. So I was there for a super long time. And towards the last few years when I was at Bergdorf's, we had sort of taken over our website. It was run eventually by a name and markets group, which is our kind of we're under the group. And it was run out of Dallas by that team, but it didn't look and feel anything like Bergdorf's. And we're like, okay, let's make this our own site. And so that led me down this path of like digital and commerce. And at that time was like, you know, I kept thinking like, this is the future. This is what's happening. And, you know, I'd been at Bergdorf so long, I had the best job in the world. And my office literally was on top of the store, overlook Central Park. It was amazing. But I also felt like I was living this life. And I was like, okay, like, I'm too young to retire, like stay here forever. I need to like push myself. I need to get myself scared, nervous again, during something I don't know. And you sure did that. Yeah, exactly. So then I made a huge move across the, across the pond. And went into global e-commerce pure play. And that was it. Metropolitan as a global buying director global buying director. And the reason I wanted to have you on here is because you love fashion. You're super chic, you're super stylish, but all of your jobs are like real numbers jobs. So some jobs at these companies are, you are sort of an editor. If you're a fashion director, and this isn't always the case, but like a lot of times the fashion director is more of an editor and they inform and they give the buying team ideas. But you were the one making the decisions with the money. And so I feel like you have that whole right brain, left brain thing that like a lot of people do not have. And so it's such a unique position to be in, in this industry in particular, because the aesthetic drives the commerce. And so that's sort of the position you were in at all these different gigs that you've had, right? Yeah, absolutely. And even as I progressed like in, in, in, in that to portray, we didn't have, we had market directors, but we didn't have a fashion director. So a lot of it was actually, it was really one role in one, because it was like, okay, what is going to be the big, like what are the big bets? What are the big hits? What are the trends? Who are the new brands to go after? And it was like, then it's like putting the money behind it. And that's really a big part of it. And then making sure that marketing or everything, every touch point of your business is talking about your product strategy, basically. And so that's sort of, you know, how that's sort of where that role went. And then after that, I went to matches to be the chief commercial officer, which is really, again, driving the whole commerce parts, everything from personal shopping to the stores, to making sure marketing is really pushing the product strategy and all of that. And, you know, obviously, you've talked a lot about matches, so we know what's happened there. And then my last position was at Farfetch, because I was like, okay, what's next? What's after, you know, brick and mortar? What's after E-com? There was sort of marketplace in luxury. And I was the chief fashion merchandising officer there. And then the CEO of Browns. And then I'm not going to talk about that. But everything kind of over, not in there. So Elizabeth's not going to talk about any of these places that she recently worked, all three of which have totally imploded, and she will not be commenting on them. But if you would like to hear about that, feel free to read puck.news and look up my name, because half of the stories that write are about this stuff. But we're going to be classy here and not go into that. And also Elizabeth did amazing work at those places. And we talked so many times. One of the reasons we got to know each other is every time I've done a story about a brand and like how they're performing at retail, one of the things that fashion journalists do is they call up buyers or fashion directors from stores and ask them like their opinion. And what I admire so much about you is that that's a hard, a lot of times I'll call people and they sort of read off an email of what they're supposed to say. And it doesn't give you a lot of insight. And you have always been so great about giving me insight into like why people like a certain brand. And you just, you're really, really clued in about that. And so all of these different places, no matter what their financial situation is right now, we're hugely influential in what we all buy and how we buy it. So your, your career is, is so fun. I cannot wait to see what you do next. I don't, you can give someone else the exclusive, I don't care, but I'll write about it no matter what.

So the reason I wanted to have you on today is I keep getting emails from people. I've talked about this a bit in Line Sheet, my newsletter at Puck. It's amazing, by the way, I'm addicted to it. So thank you. Thank you. So I have discussed this, this pricing issue. And I've been writing about, I wrote a piece on fashion inflation. The P, I think it was called fashion inflation or something 10 years ago. So this has been a thing people are talking about the price of luxury goods for at least, I mean, I'm sure forever, but at least a decade. And in the last two years or so, essentially last four years maybe, since the pandemic, the prices 2019, the prices have really started to skyrocket for luxury goods. Whereas at the lower end, you don't really see prices, but you can still buy a pair of jeans at Target for $25. Whereas a pair of designer jeans can cost over $1,000 now. So I wanted to have you on because you understand desire and what makes things good, but you also understand pricing architecture. And I thought we could go a bit behind how exactly things are priced for different channels, all of that stuff. And then also talk about how different brands price and why and what you generally think about this trend and what's going to happen. So let's start. Can you break down very quickly and like easily for super dumb people? Not that any of you are but you know, how is an item priced for a department store versus if you own your own store direct to consumer, what we were talking about previously? Okay, I mean, I think when you start from the very beginning, you start from raw materials, right? So you start from whatever the piece is, what's the fabric, what's the trims, what's used for the buttons, all of that you have to source, right? So there's a amount of that. So like I said, let's pretend a jacket takes two meters of a fabric. So you just, you literally just start with like, just putting down exactly how much everything costs to make that one item. And with that, you have to add your duties, your frays, your taxes, things like that, everything it takes for you to get from like, start to finish of getting that product into your store per se or into your wholesale channel. So that itself like builds up that kind of what we call a first cost. And usually for wholesale, they'll probably, they usually, between that first cost and the price they set the sell to a department store or e-commerce site, it's usually somewhere around 50% to 55% markup, I would say. And then when you get to that wholesale price, the stores that buy it or whoever's buying it, they want to mark up usually almost three times. So like on the low, there'll be a 2.2, but you'll get to like, some people will have a three to 3.2 markup. And that's what ends up in the store. So that's sort of like in the most general basic average numbers. Okay, so that is super helpful. And the other reason that they mark up is because a lot of product ends up getting discounted, right? So you, the department store, the retailer has to make some money off of the item that they're selling. So the person selling the brand is going to factor in that they might also have to mark the product down. So they price it knowing that you're going to have to mark it up to eventually maybe mark it down if it's not a hit or yeah. And they'll have their suggested retail too, because they'll have their direct channel. So sometimes it's a bit lower because maybe they have, they put a higher market themselves up, their higher margin for wholesale themselves. So the markup might be lower overall, but it's to sort of hate a suggested retail across like all channels. Okay. So when the brand is pricing their item to sell to a retailer, and I know there's like a big list of things, I actually wrote a story on this once about how to price something, how to get your price right in my past life. So, but there's like a long list of items, but what are the things that go into pricing? The cost of goods, marketing cost, and can you kind of break down really quickly what they are and then we can go into how different brands approach it? Yeah. I mean, it's interesting though, because like technically when you're doing that specific price and you're not necessarily putting in overhead costs, but I think like obviously with your business and how much goes into your business, you have to think about that. So like as a retailer per se, that's why you need that 3.2 markup because you've got to sell staff, you've got real estate, you've got overhead, but that doesn't go into per se the actual pricing of the goods. I think a lot of times someone says, okay, what is our positioning? Right? So who are we, a contemporary brand? Are we a luxury brand? Like what are we? Do we want to be a good price value brand like a private label? You almost start from like what kind of pricing you want to sell at and you almost work backwards from that to make sure ensuring you're getting the margins you need, and so I think obviously when you think about like the biggest luxury brands where the prices are really high, like they have a big picture that they're also thinking about, right? And also you want to make sure you benchmark where the pricing is. If you're like I am a top top luxury brand, then you kind of want to benchmark yourself around there on a retail price. So sometimes you almost work backwards, if that makes sense. Yes, for sure. And so I assume that when you're first starting out, if you're pricing something very, very high, you're assuming that you are going to sell fewer items, but you'll make a bigger profit. Yeah, it's hard. Listen, like younger brands, like for them, so production is a whole part of it. So imagine when you're at a manufacturer, you're a big brand and you're cutting one style like thousands of units, that price comes down. So that brings your cost down. The smaller the cut is, like the less you're selling, the more expensive that production cost is. So again, when you're a small brand, sometimes you're making a very small margin just to get out into the market at a price that seems reasonable. Got it. Yes. And so a great example of this on a bigger scale is if you remember probably 15 years ago, there was a big story about J. Crew was using Loro Piana cashmere and selling the sweaters for probably under $200 bucks. Like under $500 seems like nothing today. But there was a big story in the Wall Street Journal and it was like, oh my God, they're selling this really expensive cashmere. But it's because J. Crew sells in such a large volume that they could buy so much cashmere that they could make the sweaters cheaper than what a Loro Piana does itself, which is, I mean, and again, we're not factoring marketing in here. But Loro Piana says we don't make that many things and we use the finest cashmere we have. So our sweaters are $1500 and J. Crew is $200, etc. But the more volume you have, the more money you can make. And if in the ideal world, you're a Louis Vuitton and you make, you sell a ton of stuff at a very high margin and you make $20 billion a year in sales and your profits are insane. Their profits are what? Probably like for luxury brands, generally, the what is the profit margin? It's like, is it 60 to 80% if you're doing it right? Yeah, exactly. And for a lower end brand, like a contemporary brand, it's like 40% margin or? Probably like 40, 45. I mean, hopefully they're getting to 45. And if you're like at the lowest and if you look at like a gap inks margins, you can see over the last 20 years, they just get smaller and smaller and smaller every year, it could be like in the 20% of the profit margin. It's and a prime arc is probably 10% or something. Yeah, I can't understand that price. And because I just, I can't even, I can't even forget that one. I don't want to know. I don't, I haven't bought anything there since 2004. It's fine. I did buy stuff there when I lived in the UK though, just like a couple times I went in. I think my father came to visit from China and he went in there and he said he could be just he didn't understand. He's prices are cheaper than what you buy in China. So that's unbelievable to me. Yeah, it's it feels like the workers must be paying Primark. Yeah. So a lot of it, I would say, let's let's give these brands, let's give them some grace and say that a lot of this, I mean, this stuff does cost money. If you if you don't want your workers paying you, you if you need to pay your workers anything, it does cost money to produce clothes. They're not, they're not fair wages, right? Fair wages. Like you need to have fair wages. You have all these rules and place think about sustainability. And now it's even harder because if you're trying to be more sustainable, that's like all adds costs into the whole supply chain. Yes. So these clothes and these products do cost a good amount of money. There is however, and this kind of comes back to what you were talking about with where do you want to be positioned in the market? It depends on the brand. And I don't know if we were talking about Hermes on on Tuesday, but I've when I've interviewed the CEO of Hermes, what he says is we do not use marketing for our pricing. And I believe him 98% because the thing is you could charge way more for an Hermes Birkin than they charge. I mean, they're crazy expensive. They're like $20,000, but they could charge double that and the people who would buy it who spend 20 grand on a bag would still spend that. So I do think out of all of the luxury brands, as usual Hermes is in a class of its own and they do, I do believe that they are more prudent when it comes to pricing. They're not trying to sell as many bags as they can. They're trying to sell the right amount of bags and make the right profit. Pricing has gone up so much in the luxury market in the last few years. Can you explain sort of what has happened broadly with these brands? Yeah, I would say, I mean, it's interesting because there's some steps that have happened even prior to COVID. So things like, you know, there were different, like let's say a brand had stores all over the world and they had different pricing per currency. And there's a point where everyone's like, okay, let's try to actually have a more even price across the board globally, right? So there was a price raise at that time. Price rationalization. Yeah, exactly. Is that what they could there is another word they all used? Harmonization. Yeah, price harmonization. So that kind of happened at a point too. And there's a point sometimes where, you know, so two things, there's literally sometimes supply and demand, right? So I don't know if you ever did this, but like there was a point where cashmere pricing just or cotton, like just the pure goods materials shot up because the middle class in China became so big, these economy there, as you know, over the past 10 years. And there just wasn't enough cashmere. So cashmere costs so much. So any of your brands are like, like that was their primary, you know, knitwear was their primary thing, all of a sudden their prices. So there are sometimes where it's literally a supply and demand thing where the pricing goes up and it's not, it's and it's overnight. So sometimes you're like, price just has to go up because that's how much we're buying it for. So this sort of has been happening over time. And that happened a lot more post COVID as well. But then I think there's also this idea of, you know, where should we be in the market and this actual idea of scarcity, right? And exclusivity, especially when you want to be a luxury luxury brand. And I think there's a point where like remember when the Chanel two by five cost two by five, five, like, yeah, right. Yeah. I was talking, you know, I was talking about this on the powers that be with Peter Hamby, my Puck partner. Yeah. And that's what I bought one in 2010 at the Chanel store in Soho. I went to Boqueria, had a Bloody Mary. I can't believe I drank at 11am or whatever, went in and I got a flap bag and I think I paid $2,500 for it, which I shouldn't have bought it then, but I still have it. But now they're, how much are they now? The larger size one, I think is 11,000. So, you know, it's God. Yeah. But it had several price likes, but I remember when there was a problem where they're like, you know, when almost too many people had the Chanel bag, and I think, you know, when you're a luxury company, you're like, I don't want to be on the 13 year old, you know, like, yeah, or the 27 year old who put it on her credit card. So it's sort of like this idea too of like, and of course, like Chanel, I mean, they use the finest quality, everything's hand stitched, inspection control. I mean, there's so much that does go into the quality and these are the best quality, you know, brands in the world. But there's a point to where you're like, actually, and want to make less so the price probably will go up and we want less out there, you know, so then when you do these price sites, you're hoping to have gain that sort of exclusivity. And what's funny is whenever the price like people go crazy and they buy as many as they can, because they're like, oh my God, the price is going up. Yes. Oh, that's very, very true. And have you noticed it also, because we think of it very much in the context of handbags, and there's always sort of a whisper campaign, the price is going up April 1st or the price is going up May 1st and exactly what happens happens and people go nuts and buy it. I've noticed it with shoes. I remember 2013, I bought a pair of Saint Laurent, Hedy Salman Saint Laurents that I still own and wear and get resold. Like now I live in Atlanta, I don't need to get resold because I don't walk anywhere. But they're the perfect Chelsea boot. I think I paid $900 for them and it was the most I'd ever spent on a pair of shoes. And now there are very few brands that have shoes under $800 and Minolos when Height of Sex and City, they were $400 because I remember the episode where Carrie Bradshaw's like, I have $32,000 worth of shoes in my house or something like that. I don't remember. But other products other than bags, has that been accelerated? And when did you notice really starting to happen? Yeah, I mean, absolutely. I feel like, I mean, 2021, you really saw big price hikes. And I think a lot came post COVID. I think people had to make up for a lot of loss in that time. But in that time, so many business, like imagine the whole supply chain. So all of a sudden, there are a lot of fabric mills closed down, a lot of businesses shut down along the chain. So like, let's say all of a sudden, you've got less fabric mills out there, they have to supply for more people. So the labor, like the cost of labor, the cost of the actual materials have increased purely because there's less factories per se, probably less mills, less of that, like less tannery is or they had to make up for the time that they were all closed. So like those costs have all increased. And then you think about transportation costs, like those have all increased significantly too. I mean, DHL, I mean, all of these things, like everything taken into account, those costs have all gone up as well, like fulfillment costs have gone up. And at the same time, the cost of selling, like just every part of it, right, every part of the whole chain from the start to finish has increased since COVID as well. And I think so a lot of brands had to, like they literally all their costs are higher. So like, whatever they paid for in it back in next day to today is a toy to price. So we add the markup button. So some of them are reasonable because it is literally from a cost increase. But then there's some brands where I think they wanted to be perceived as like the Louis Vuitton's and the Hermes's and the Chanel's. And therefore they have elevated their pricing to not really have that entry price point and to just be sort of at that level where it's that highest spending consumer, which today is sort of like the most, you know, like, let's say that's the consumer that's most steady, right, when there's fluctuation than what's ever happened in the economy. Yeah, and you can see that in all the earnings reports that have come out in the last week and a half where what LVMH said generally was that that high end consumer is still spending. And so of course they're going to cater to the person. If you talk to someone at a department store, it's always like 80% of our sales come from sometimes two per- Like one to two percent of the customer. On line, it's like 40% comes from one to two percent of the customers. It's remarkable. So it makes sense that you want to cater to those people. How is the customer responding to that at this moment in time? It's hard. I mean, it is hard because when you look at all these businesses, any business that remains flat or has any increase, it's purely off the increased prices. It's not increased units that they're selling, right, right now. So I think, and brands have had to do that just to make sure they're keeping their businesses and doors open. I would say it's, I think the customer, especially now because there's less discretionary spending and if they're going to spend, there's a more sort of this experiential side of things. So in terms of just, I think when you saw people really investing in handbags during COVID because they just weren't going out and they're like, I can go crazy and buy this handbag. I've always wanted, you definitely see that like people pulling back now. I think you see brands like Tory Burch doing really well because it's got that quality. It's got that name, but it has that price value relationship that just makes a lot of sense. And it's sort of, there's not that many brands in that tier that are like affordable luxury, I would say. That has a point of view. One of my favorite MBA terms and I don't have many is price value equation. I just think it really does say a lot. Like, do people feel like they are getting their money's worth, no matter what the price is? Because sometimes when you go to Primark, you don't feel like you're getting anything, but you go to Alex Mill or something and you're like, okay, this feels quality for the price or you go to absolutely oral Piana and you feel like, okay, this is, I understand why this is so expensive.

Question for you on the very high-end customer. In the U.S., and I don't know if this sort of attitude is as strong in other parts of the world because we are such a deals and discount-driven culture because of the way the public markets work and you just need to give shareholders money every single quarter. And so you discount goods to sell more goods. And it's a really terrible cycle at every price point. But there is a feeling of, I don't want to spend too much money on something, even if you're really, really rich because you don't want to be perceived as being a sucker. But this is why quiet luxury begins at a big trend in the past few years. That's true. Like the Roe Margo bag, you can't even keep it in stock anywhere. But it's a 4,000 pound bag and it's completely has no logo, nothing. It's beautiful, beautifully made and it has no label. You can't tell who makes it unless you know. And that has done super well. At the high, high end, do you think people are like, even the people who are collecting these expensive bags, do you think they're kind of like, that's a crazy price for those leather pants? I'm not going there. Or do you think that that's more of an attitude among people who are kind of a level in income level, maybe still in the 1% but not in the 0.01% percent? I mean, it's interesting. I feel like when it comes to something that you think is an investment, so you will spend it. But there is a, even at the top, top, top level, I think there's a bit, like we have so much now to be really, I think there is, there is a bit more consciousness in just another, just like buying something like that. I do think so. And the prices are where you do think right. Because even at the highest level, you want to feel, especially because you're very smart about your money, that's how you've reached the highest level of course luxury customer, is you want to feel like it's the right, exactly price value relationship and that it's fine. I am willing to spend that because it's worth it. I do think people think that a lot. Yeah, you always think rich people don't get rich by spending their money on all this stuff. Sometimes they do, especially if they got rich from crypto or something like that and somehow managed to get out at the right time. But yeah, I mean, the other part of this that sort of factors in is this huge divide between what products cost on the high street versus what they cost at a luxury goods store. And that is also crazy to me. I mean, I mean, from your perspective, do you think clothes at the lower end are often just too, too cheap? And that is skewing the sort of, I remember I house set for someone once had a beautiful, beautiful home in Los Angeles before I lived here and definitely had a lot of money and had a closet full of designer shoes and handbags and then the whole all of her clothes were Zara. And I remember being like, this is as someone who tends to, I actually don't, I do have a Chanel bag, but I think that's the only fancy bag. Don't come to my house and rob me. There's not anything here, but I will spend a good amount of money on a dress, even though I don't wear it that much for, I don't really know why I think that's working in fashion and I just am screwed up. But do you think that there is, there needs to be a sort of, we focus so much on the high end and marketing at the high end that at the lower end, there needs to be like a recalibration of how people think about how many things they should buy a year and instead of once a week, once a month or once every three months or whatever. I mean, we think about fast fashion. That's what it is. It's mass produced goods. So when you take every part of that, you feel the fabric. It's a lot, it's like the, it's the pilot, some of the least expensive fabric that's out there. You think about how it's made. It's all made on a machine. It's all made in countries, not in Europe or the US or the UK per se. And they fall apart pretty quickly or the stitching might come off or the button might come off. They're not, they're made in a mass way where obviously the quality and is nothing like a luxury product. And obviously there's people, we think about everyone and people in the world, like you need product at that price. I mean, if people can't all, you need different price points for everyone, you know, and everyone who can afford fashion, even on the low level, still wants to look good. They still want trends. They still want that, right? So you kind of need to have all of these different price buckets. I would say Zara, Zara's actually increased their prices and that's why, one of the reasons why they've done pretty well and their quality is applied a little bit better. You know, what's worrisome is the stuff that's, you know, literally, I can't believe the pricing on Shine or Timmy or all of these. Because I don't even know how you can produce that. And again, that's those clothes. That's, that's to me, it's like disposable clothing and people treat it that way, which is obviously not great environment either. And that's like mass, mass, mass production to get pricing like that, which again, I don't, I can't understand how they get that pricing. Interesting. You brought those companies up because they do a lot of on-demand production. It's crazy that they charge nothing. That part of it doesn't make sense, but they do so much. A lot of these fast fashion companies for, for our listeners have, they do something called, they work with grayish fabrics. So they cut a product, but then they don't dye it. And so you can kind of change it up a little bit right at the last minute. Zara does this, H&M does this, but definitely Zara, it's a big part of Zara's success is it's almost making stuff on demand. And Sheehan and Timo, I don't know as much about, but they are doing a lot of this on-demand production. But the biggest issue for them is the shipping. So they're flying the stuff all over the world, which is just terrible for the environment and, and also expensive and all of that. So yes, I don't understand how they're doing it. What I think the trend is going to be for all of these people, all of these retailers and all of these brands is more localized production, which Zara has a lot of local production. And you see that in LA, a lot of these fast fashion, they'll do by the piece items, one-offs here or, or really fast. But if production on the lower end can get automated, then these prices will make sense. But until that happens, it is just, I don't understand all these companies make any money and it's just going to get worse and worse. Do you see the, I guess the question for you is, do you see the divide between the high and low just increasing? Yeah, it's more, it's definitely more extreme. It's more extreme. It definitely is more extreme now. It's a thousand percent more extreme. Because even like you said, like these brands that we, like, you know, like we love to buy fashion, you and I, and we're like, we were stretching it. We're like, I'm going to buy some, you know, Celine, like Phoebe Phila, Celine, I'm going to stretch it on, I bought the Hedi Slan, Sala Ra, etc. And now it's almost like, if I looked at it now, I'm like, actually, I can't buy that now. It's, it's, it is like over even my price, like my price range, you know? So then it's something that you have to really think about many times before purchasing. With the Phoebe Phila stuff, I bought a bag that I ended up selling to someone else at cost. I didn't make any money, but it just wasn't, it was $3,500 and it was, I hadn't bought, spent that much on a bag since I bought the, well, I didn't spend that much on it when I bought the Chanel, but I hadn't bought a nice bag in like 12 years over that amount of money. And so it wasn't worth it to me because it just wasn't exactly right. And maybe if I had seen it in the store, I would have been more convinced. And now I'm going to go to Bergdorf and see everything. And I love that they're doing that. But I did buy a shirt and like it, I'm going to wear it today. I talked to someone who's like a big collect, was a big Celine collector, old Celine collector, and she bought a ton of the stuff. She got the bag in white, it looked really, really good, the gig bag. I do really like it. But she was even saying, and she's someone who, you know, she devotes a lot of her income to clothing. She works in the business and that it's a big part of her life. I don't know how rich she is. She's definitely rich enough to buy this stuff. But I don't think, you know, she's conscious of what she's, what she's spending on. But she was like, this is just too much money. And for me, it was, it was, I really defended it when it first came out. But for me, it was the leather pants. I was just like $5,000 for a pair of pants, just seems completely insane to me. And that might be what they have to be because leather is a raw material that is clearly more expensive. I mean, Prada is selling leather coats for $8,000, $20,000. It clearly there's not, in some of these cases, it has to be what it is. But I do think there is a, if you have any sense of money at all, which 99% of people do, there does become a breaking point where you're just like, if I bought those leather pants, I'd be so embarrassed. I mean, I did buy leather pants and I am a little embarrassed because I'm not really a leather pants person. I got these great Proenza school white leather ones. They're really good. They were, I think $800 and a friend of mine helped. She had a discounted a retailer and I got them a little bit on sale, but I couldn't have done it. And so I think that's the trickiness, was I willing to spend $1,000 on a shirt from Phoebe Philo? Yeah. But it was still a lot. I mean, some people are obsessed with fabrications, right? There's, I always joke, there's customers who are allergic to wool, right? And I think with leather, with leather, you know, like the quality of leather goes from like, super affordable to like butter, like when you feel that it's like butter, I don't love, right? And like, when you feel that you feel it, you know, like when I feel a little webbing coat, it's just like, oh yeah, right? Like the row or leather from the row, like you, you know, it's expensive and you know, cost of fortune, the actual leather and then the craftsmanship behind it. So I think there's, and if you're at that level, then, and you feel that and you see that, then it's worth it, you know? I think Phoebe Philo, I think in her case, her production runs were probably so small that those costs were just really high too. Yes. And I hope that those pants are not at the burgdorff shop when I go because I cannot buy them. Remember we had a customer at Burgdorff stock in the day who used to buy two of everything Chanel and we, our seamstresses would make it into one. So, and she was one of the biggest customers, she bought two of everything and cost was of no, the prices of no, like just no concern. It's amazing. Oh man, it's, it's fun. It's fun being a shopper. So, so what do you think, given that all of the discourse around this, what is the move for the brands? Like what do they do next about this? Because they need to make money, they need to make profits, they need to make sure the customer's happy. What do they do? I think, I mean, some brands are actually having a building a strategy out of it, right? It's interesting when you look at some brands and you're like, let's face, I'm going to take Alaya, for example, now. Alaya was used, you know, I bought my first Alaya dress in February. So, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I can't believe it took this long. It's amazing. And it used to be, you know, I remember going to do the buys and Mr. Alaya was there. And the thing is, that was the top of the top of the top. The pricing was more than anything else in the entire store. Alaya was the top. When you look at the pricing now, I think it's amazing. Like I literally am like, look at that bag, look at that belt, look at that dress and the craft, everything behind that, it is like, who cares? I'm going to, you're going to spend it because that is a good price now, right? So that's, they have a clever, they have a clever pricing strategy today especially. Yeah. It's so, so it's clever because it's not, it's obviously not cheap, but it's not like, it feels correct. Yes. And it's Alaya, right? It's the best made product in the world. And it looks great. And you actually know who, like it actually doesn't scream Alaya, but you know it's Alaya. I went to the showroom to see the new collection, which was, I think, is this the one that was all made of wool or something? It was just incredible. Oh, the one piece. Yeah. The one piece. It was insane. So I'm like, I'm going to go downstairs because I actually had gotten an Alaya blazer. I already, two episodes in, sound like an insane. I really do not spend that much money on clothes. I spend a lot on items, but I do not buy that much, but I had gotten an Alaya blazer to wear to work events for the next 50 years over the holidays and it was 50% off, whatever. It was great. I was like, oh, maybe I'll buy a pair of pants to go with it because, you know, the exchange rate, all that stuff. The lady gives me like 15 things. I try on these dresses and I was like, holy shit. These dresses make me look totally different and also are beautiful. And like you said, you can wear it forever and the quality and the dress that I ended up buying, which was, especially with a discount with the VAT return, like not crazy in any way. And she was like, this is the closest thing you're going to get to Couture if you're not buying Couture. And so I was like, okay, I'm going to buy it. And then I didn't buy anything else on the trip. But, but, um, yeah. So they had a good, like I feel like they have a really good strategy going on now. And the quality is amazing and the design, the whole thing, the concept, I think it's hard. I think some of the big luxury brands, I've had meetings with them where they even have said, like we started outpricing ourselves, but it's very hard to go back. It's very hard. You know, and then you need to find some like entry price point things. And I think that's sort of where they are probably going to be now, you know, like bringing back what is the new tote bag or sneak or something that we can get people back in with. I did notice that's interesting because I noticed in the recent issue of Harper's Bazaar with Regina King on the cover, they did a white sneaker page. And it was all designer sneakers. And we've been moving so far away from that because I feel like so many of the brands pre COVID were so dependent on sneakers for their business. And these sneakers that are coming back are just like very simple tennis shoes, essentially. I think the best example is that Loewe sneaker that I kind of want to buy because it doesn't L on it, but I'm not really a designer sneaker person. I'm more of a classic new balance, Keds, that type of thing. But that's an interesting point. So it might be great for the consumer because there's going to be more options from these brands that we love. Or think about beauty, like everyone stepping into beauty. Beauty is like that's the first step in, right? You can buy the lipstick and that's your way into the brand. But I think you always need something to bring you in at a lower price point. And so that's the challenge that's going to happen now. Yeah. And I would say if you want Hermes shoes, a lot of their shoes are under $800. Hermes is actually a pretty good deal, everyone. That's the lesson. Elizabeth, thank you so much for being here. Is there anything else that you want to say about this? I think it's about going back to, and I don't take too long, but it's interesting. There's a business case with Harvard Business School on Gucci and when Domenico de Sole came in and his strategy. The king. Exactly. When he kind of took the, like, decided, okay, let's take this brand to the next level, let's get it out of where it is. And they literally, they actually vague it in a chart. It was funny because I was like, I don't think of things in a chart because I'm a merchant. Just think of it naturally. But we're creating a product that he compared the pricing to similar brands and then ones that were higher in terms of the luxury consumers perspective. And then he looked at quality and said, okay, I'm going to price slightly under, but I'm going to have the same quality. And it was, it's sort of a very strategic way to have, we kind of relaunched at the time the line in the bag. So it's mostly leather goods at the time, right? And I think those, it's like, you have to think about that. And that really, really made the business what it is for a very long time. And it's about that attitude towards pricing or that strategy behind it. And I feel like we've sort of straight away from that, I need to kind of go back to thinking about that. It's interesting you mentioned that because a lot of caring brands still employ that or, you know, Bottega Veneta, which my friend makes fun of me for saying it like that, but that's how you say it, right? Yes. Yes. So Jason, that's how you say it. You're never going to listen to this, but it's fine. But they are, that is their highest end brand in terms of pricing. But if you look at Saint Laurent and Gucci to an extent, their prices have gotten higher, but it's still not the highest. But Saint Laurent has like actually, it's not affordable, but stuff that is more, it feels more entry approachable. This was so much fun. I love chatting with you. I'm going to be in London in a few weeks for this Gucci thing. So maybe we can have a drink or something. That would be amazing. I would love to see you here. So thanks for having me. Thanks for being here. And I can't wait to see what you do next. Fashion People is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck News, hosted by Lauren Sherman. That's me.
