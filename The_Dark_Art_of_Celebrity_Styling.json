Hi, I'm Lauren Sherman and welcome back to fashionpeople. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's annual costume institute gala, better known as the Met Ball, is one of the biggest red carpet moments of the year for A-list celebrities. But it wasn't always like that. While the first Monday in May is most associated with its chair, Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, as well as the cadre of famous friends she recruits to attend, it was once quite the insular affair. And by the way, for a time in the 1990s, Wintour and then Harper's Bazaar editor-in-chief Liz Tobaris would actually trade off hosting duties. Today though, the Upper East Siders paying to attend are few and far between. The tables, which can cost more than six figures, are scooped up by fashion brands, but the real winners in Anna Wintour's Met Gala transformation are the celebrities who use the famous steps as a platform quite unlike a Hollywood awards show. What makes the Met special? On today's episode, I have with me one of the industry's top celebrity stylists, Kate Young, to discuss the mechanics of the pink carpet. How are you, Kate? Oh, good. What did you have for breakfast this morning? Did you eat breakfast? I do eat breakfast. I eat oatmeal. It's really boring. My thing is going to be asking everyone what they had for breakfast or if they've eaten today since people think fashion people don't eat. I love how obsessed you are with everyone's eating disorders. Do you ever have a newsletter that doesn't mention Osempic? Yes. Sometimes, sometimes I will say the mention gets slipped in there by someone else. Yeah. When I started, I was told there will be a reward for the Puck writer who mentions Osempic the most and I was like, oh, I can definitely do that. There's motive. Yes. I have not received the reward yet, so we'll see. So thank you for being here today. You're one of my very early guests and I don't want this to be a podcast about people's journeys because everyone, there are Reddit threads about you. People who are listening to this know your journey, but the reason I love talking to you and think you hold a special place in the industry is because you have a very unique background that gives you perspective that I don't think any other celebrity stylist has. Like when I think of you, when I was coming up, I think you were the fashion director of the interview, but already styling celebrities and you did in style. And so to me, you were a magazine editor who also styled really high profile celebrities. And that is also reflected in what you do on the red carpet. And just curious really quickly, like can you give a bit of a background of how you started out and how you ended up in the red carpet world? Because that crossover rarely happens and to have legitimacy on both sides is you're really the only one. Oh, thank you. I think that it's a really clear trajectory. I started as an assistant at Vogue and I kind of worked my way up. I was the junior, I'm trying to remember what the title was. I think I was called the junior fashion associate at Vogue. And what that meant was that I styled all the non-well stories. So, you know, when you look through a magazine, there's like a million pictures of like the new dermatologist, the cool architect, the woman who's the hit new hit on Broadway. And I styled all of that. So all the sort of working pages of Vogue were original imagery that I styled. And there was a page in the front of book at the time called People Are Talking About, which is about the hot actress who was in like the cool movie or, you know, the breakout star. And I did that page for a while. And because Vogue had so much budget at the time, that's everybody knows we used to kill a lot of stories. So I would shoot like sometimes I would shoot three young actresses a month and only one would run. But because I was doing that, I was meeting all the publicist and I was meeting all the like hot new things. And a lot of times like celebrity stylists weren't really a thing at the time. A lot of they didn't have stylists and didn't work with stylists. But they would say things like, oh, could I borrow this look to wear to my premiere? And I had worked in the market department at Vogue. So I would just call the PR people and say, I'm with this actress. Could she borrow it on this date? And so I started kind of just styling people out of photo shoots. And then when I became freelance and started doing interview and ID and still Vogue and team Vogue, a lot of the publicists would reach out to me and say, like, oh, so and so has a premiere. Would you would you consider like styling them for these three events or something? It was just different than it is now. Like a whole movie would have three events that an actress would be styled for, not 30 days with airport looks and changes. My God. So so you really work with super A list people. So when they have something to promote, you have to plan out 30 days of look sometimes. And how how far in advance are you doing that? When it's 30 days, we usually we usually fit the looks for those 30 events, like maybe a week before or two weeks before. But then when you're on a tour with somebody that long, the looks you fit, you know, a month and a half ago, start to seem on an exciting and like looks will that are slotted for something will change. If you get to London, did you press and it's actually like pouring rain in 30 degrees, wearing like the silk dress with more tights isn't a good idea. So looks get all jumbled around and sort of taken apart. So we usually sit again in the middle to kind of update with what's working and what's comfortable and what they're feeling. And this at this point, how big is your team that works for you with you all year round? Or like one person full time in the other room. And then we always have an intern or junior assistant. And then I have two people on LA and then the rest is sort of like when we need more help, we bring in more free answers. And do you and then we'll get to the Met Gala, which is what I really want to talk to you about. But when it comes to tailoring, one thing I think about your clients is that they are clothes always fit them, which is a real challenge on the red carpet. I think because a lot of people are using samples and. Do you employ, do you have go to tailors? Is it usually that the brand has an in-house tailor and you work really closely with them? Like how demanding do you have to be when it comes to fit and managing that? I almost always work with my own tailors. I'm very loyal to them and I love them. And I think I also, you have to be able to trust someone and also know that they understand what you're talking about. And I've quirks about tailoring like things I like done a certain way. I didn't go to fashion school. I don't really know how to sell, but I really understand construction at this point and understand like what's going to make a difference. As you probably know, like I'm a talker and I ask a lot of questions and I want to know why something worked and why it didn't work. And like talking to tailors over years and years makes it much easier for me to be like it's a real struggle for me when I work with Italian designers because I don't speak Italian and French. I speak badly, but I speak really good tailoring. Like I know all the words in French and I can understand what they're saying. And when I work with, for instance, when I work with Prada, I'm always like, oh God, I have no idea what they're saying. And I don't like, I hope they understand what I'm saying. I was in a meeting with a bunch of executives in France a few years ago. And one of them said to me, can we at least speak Italian? I was like, no. I said, I took Latin in school. I can't speak anything. Me too. The only thing I can do. I took eight years of Latin. I can read Vogue in any romance language. Exactly. It makes it easy to kind of understand what's going on. But when picking up the sounds, what are some of the things that people say in French that like you hear repeated again and again by tailors? That are you're glad you understand what they're saying? No, it's just knowing basic things. Like I put horsehair in a lot of the hems of dresses because they have to work. And like they have to walk and look good. And if you put a horsehair in the hem of a dress that can be a little bit light, it'll keep it hanging down. And I also put grosgrain in dresses a lot of the time at the waist just to anchor the dress because there's like my pet pee is seeing some of the things that I pet pee is seeing someone yanking in a dress and pulling it up. And if there's a grosgrain at the waist, it holds the dress there. So like there are little weird things that I do a lot of the time just so that I want to make sure they're not on the red carpet, like trying to fish a hem out from under a shoe or pulling their dress around them because of wind. And I want to make sure they're not like yanking to make sure their boobs are in the dress and a grosgrain can do that. That's really interesting. Do you find you live in New York? Do you find that managing this sort of stuff is easier for something like the Met because you can go from your house or does that not really matter? Because if there's a big event, you're going to be in LA anyway. And the proximity is there regardless. I guess it's easier. I mean, the Met, it's interesting you are having me do this interview because the Met is a totally different monster than all the other ones. I think at this time of year, I don't want to get on another plane and go to another award show. I'm really sick of LA. I'm really, you know, it's it's a lot of travel, January and February. And I'm happy to be at home. There's also a lot of stuff with my family. My kids went to Waldorf school. They don't anymore. And like Mayday is always the Saturday before the Met. So like it was really great to me always that I could like go to this festival and then do a fitting. I remember that your kid went to Waldorf. I remember seeing you at like a Fort Green or Clinton Hill subway station and talking about it. And my kid does not. He goes to Montessori, but he does have a play group that's a Waldorf thing. And I always think of you. It's the best. It's so lovely. He goes to the fairy princess Waldorf play group on the weekend. And then he goes to like Neaton orderly Montessori, where he does jobs. I'm like, he can he can clean your kitchen and maybe he really can. Yeah, every day he comes home and I say, what did you do? And he said, I did jobs. I'm really funny.

You said it's different from any of these other events. What was your first experience with the Met? Did you have to deal with it when you worked at Vogue? Now the Vogue staffers are sort of there. Was it like that back then as well? Yes. I was Anna's assistant. And that's the first Met Ball I ever went to. And what I had to do at that Met Ball, first I had to memorize, it was like a Facebook. You know, like everybody who was coming with their face in bio and I had to memorize lots so that I knew all their names. And I had to stand behind Anna the whole time and whisper people's names in her ears and make sure like certain people, they had a drink after she said hello to them, that I like moved them through the room, made them comfortable. Like it was, I was just there like if in case anything went wrong. I said that she knew everybody's name but in case she needed someone, you know, like that my job was to just kind of watch. That was the Versace Met Ball. Did you wear Versace? No, I was Anna's assistant. What did, what did you wear? The one, the one time I covered the cocktails, I had to interview her before and she was like, what are you wearing? And I didn't tell her. I wouldn't tell her. I was wearing a tibie dress. She didn't need to know. Oh, amazing. I wore Anna Mulemeister. It was like a black velvet bias dress and just sleeveless. And I wore hot pink lipstick that I got from the beauty closet because I had to leave work to go there. And I was very, very excited because my picture was in the New York Posts but they identified me as Celine Velandez. Amazing. Who was also an assistant at Vogue and is my friend but my mom has it still and she's always like, look, you're Celine Velandez. And I'm like, that's hilarious because we're still friends. That's really, really funny. And what was it like then versus now? Because it's become this big pop culture event. Whereas back then, years that I, I think I covered it for like two or three years in the mid-2010s, it was still felt very upper East Side. And when I talked to a lot of those sort of attendees that would patrons of the museum that would attend, it seems like now it's much more celebrity driven. Back then, were there tons of celebrities? Was that as big a part of it or how have you seen that change? I think at that one, I think Courtney Love was there, which was really cool for me because I was a huge whole fan. Obviously, she was like a hero. And I think Princess Diana was there. Princess Diana was around a lot in my early Vogue Anatimes. So this is like the mid to late 90s. I think it was 97. Well, she died in 97. So, yeah, so it's possible that she was there. Yeah. But no, like the people who were there that I remember being kind of dazzled by because remember, I was like, I subscribed to W Magazine when it was like a folded color pieces, newspaper in college. So I was really obsessed with all the socialites. Like by that point, I was used to seeing models and like the celebrities would come in to meet Anna before Jane Reitzman was there and K Graham was there. But like I almost died when Mika Ertegun and Chessie Rainer came in. I had never seen people more chic. They came in together and they were probably both like 70 or 80 years old. I mean, they were ancient. But like the chicness, you know, like the pictures you see of like Holston and YSL's muses where they have like turbines and jewelry and like style, you know, like they were the chicest. So it was very that like it was very that sort of very wealthy upper East side patrons of the art kind of society event then with like a like smattering of models and designers and famous people that like up to the glamour maybe. And how would you track if you were kind of giving a timeline or telling a story of the Met Ball under Anna Wintour's reign? How would you track the sort of trajectory of it? Because I'm assuming even after you were working of a full time, you were dipping in and out of that because of your other work. And I'm sure you've seen what happened. At some point, celebrities started going, right? So like I had clients who went and it didn't seem like that big a deal. You know, like celebrities go to charity events, right? And it felt more like, oh, yeah, designer asked me to go and they made my Oscar dress. So that would be nice. But then at a certain point, it did turn into like everybody's going or everybody wants to go. And also that probably was around the time also that like a lot of clients started having contracts with brands. So like, you know, when Louis Vuitton used to take like 12 people, you know, it all kind of coincided. And then I think the real turn where it became sort of more what it is now maybe this year was a YouTube host who sponsored it. When maybe Amazon fashion. Yeah, like 2013 or something. That's when I started to realize like people outside of this world really knew about it. Yeah. You know, it seemed like I guess also, you know, like Fabiola made that movie first Monday in May. Yeah, Fabiola Barracasa, who is how would you describe her? I'm like, my God, she lives my dream life. She's like the nicest person with a great collection of jewelry and clothes and art. And she lives in the North beautiful house and has a lovely husband and great kids and her Instagram is just like, yeah, you live the best life I've ever seen. Wikipedia describes Fabiola Barracasa Beckman as a film and television producer, philanthropist and socialite. That sounds and she was born in Caracas, Venezuela. That sounds about right. Yeah. Like when to couture shows as a baby on her mother's lap, she's just like lovely and fun and funny and great. Also, that film sort of coincides with and obviously the September issue and I don't know if it actually came out in 08, but with Vogue as a brand, as a pop culture brand, which it always was, but what that meant as magazines lost influence. Well, it's like as magazines stop set, like there's no magazines at the manicurist or the doctor or now there's Vogue events, right? Yes. Yeah, exactly. It's an interesting thing and it's been funny to see on the publishing side what I noticed and observed from friends who work in magazines or at websites or whatever that the Metgala became the biggest day of traffic for them. And I don't this year, I'm curious. I'll have to like get a read out from friends because the Oscars were such a big thing online this year that I would suspect that the Oscars will actually be more impactful in terms of traffic. I don't know if these magazines are measuring page use anymore anyway. They're so relevant to advertisers, but the Metgala for a few years was the biggest traffic day of the year for magazines that have nothing to do with Vogue. And I'm curious from your perspective, you work with a selection of very A-list actresses. So your mix is specific people who seem to also have an interest in fashion or you at least make them look like they do and they're not going to like a million things. They're going to the stuff they need to go to, but like how many people have you done for one Metgala? Have you done more than one in one night or is it usually just one? I think one time there was fine. I mean sometimes it's a lot. Yeah. Are you doing people for this one? Yeah, I'm doing Michelle Williams and then I'm doing Jeremy Strong, which I don't style men, but he's my friend and he asked and I'm trying, but I don't know. That's exciting. My best effort. He's really into fashion though. Yes, he is, which makes it more scary for me because I'm like, I don't know anything about men's clothes. I don't even know the words. Oh my God. Well, it's good because at least he will have an opinion and so whatever you do, you can just blame him. How long have you been working with Michelle for? 18 years. Yeah, we started working together right after Matilda was born. The relationship I assume you have with a lot of these people, I mean that's a friendship and that's a partnership. That's not like a dip in and dip out situation. No, I mean we know each other. I saw you went with her to the Dior show in Brooklyn. She looked, you also looked amazing. Will it make that part of it seamless because you know each other so well? Yeah. Yes. It's a very easy relationship. It's enjoyable. We like spending time together. We spend time together when we don't have to work. It's not always true but the thing that's different about the Met Gala from something like the Oscars is that the designers hold the power. So if you're going to the Oscars, you're going to a movie premiere, you're going to promote your own work, right? And you're going with your crew. You're going with your publicist and your manager is there, your lawyer and probably your husband or your boyfriend or your girlfriend. This is your event and when I do a fitting for that, most of the time we call in a lot of designers and we pick the dress that feels best, right? So for the Met Gala, you are paired with a designer and the designer has bought that seat and you may not take anybody with you. It's like, it's very awkward for a lot of celebrities because they don't have any buffer. You know, and a lot of times they don't know the designer and further to that, the designer is making the dress. I know some stylists are sort of designers. I don't like that role. Like I'm good at architecture and I'm good at making a gown but I don't like it when gowns exist outside of the context of like the most recent show or the vernacular of the brand. And I'm also like weirdly more starstruck by designers and photographers a lot of times than I am by actresses. They're the people I really am obsessed with so it's hard for me to be bossy. So I usually function more as a, well, okay, so this is your idea. I see your sketch and this is your dream but like she has to cover her arms and we need a waistband and you know, she's not going to wear flats. So my job is more as like a consultant or like a stylist on a fashion show as opposed to like I've come up with a look. Got it. I mean, well, that's where your editorial experience comes in. Yeah. That the thing you said about the context of the dress not existing outside of this event and it being a part of the brand's vernacular and I'm sure that's why brands like to work with you because of gentle guidance that maybe allows them to still put out their message because it is this like collaboration between you, the brand, the person. Yeah. And making sure they are both happy. I have to be honest. I know everybody loves to talk about custom dresses and custom dresses are my nightmare. Like I hate a custom dress. There's so much pressure, you know, the difference between a sketch and a reality. Everybody sees a sketch differently and the reality is something's been custom made for you. There's like hours of work. There's thousands of dollars, all this stuff and you just might not like it. And then there's this awkwardness where people end up wearing dresses. They don't like so much. When I do custom dresses, it's usually like, okay, you see this shirt and pants on the runway. Let's make a gown out of it. How? Or you made this dress three years ago. She tried it on. She never wore it. Can we make that dress in the new embroidery? I'm not a designer for a reason. It's interesting. There have been a couple press runs in the last few weeks where I've thought about that a lot where I'm like, this person clearly made all this stuff up and it looks like the BFA, not even the MFA at Parsons or something. Right. Yeah. And you're just kind of like this. They don't look right because it looks fake and it doesn't feel professional. It can feel a little unprofessional if it goes too far. Well, I just think like, I know how to make things look cool, right? But like making a gown is really like, that's like the hardest thing you can make. I think, well, a suit also, a suit can be super tricky. But gowns, they're structurally complex. The beading is complex. I mean, that's why I like imaginary clothes on the internet and like internet, all the skins and all of that because none of the rules apply. Yeah. But like, there are a lot of rules. Gowns show your body like a bathing suit. So like you have to figure out how to make it work, you know? And so it feels like you're almost giving them an armor to walk those steps because the other thing you mentioned that it's just them and they're often with the designer. They are also not allowed to bring anybody with them on the steps, right? Right. So that is exposure that a lot of these people who I assume are actually pretty shy in many cases. It's crazy. They're shy and they're also like, okay, what do I mean? A lot of times they're like, what do I talk to these people about? I mean, what do they talk to them about? I don't know either. Yeah. Well, usually if they're going with a designer who I know or like a PR team, I know well, I'll be like, who's at their table and find out. And then I'll be like, okay, the PR woman is going to sit there. She's my friend. You'll like her. She has two kids the same age. You know, I can get into like the other people who are going to be there and give them some information and be like, look for her. You'll have something to talk about. When the broader world became interested in the Met and wanted to be there and you know, Jeff Bezos was my sort of, I remember when he was there. I think it was, maybe it was, I don't remember which tech company did it in 2013, but I remember when Amazon Fashion did it and he was around. But did you notice that like some of your clients wanted invites more that they were kind of like, should this be on my calendar? How do we get in? Because it's very like, I've gotten so many emails from publicists and designers this year or calls about, because Anna really, or her team makes the decision of who attends with whom. And so, and it's, and they're very particular about it. And sometimes it doesn't make sense to the designer who the matchup is. And you know, in the end, everybody wants her to tell them what to do. So they can't complain too much and they get to go to this amazing thing for free when it costs a lot of money. But was there a moment when you had some clients who were like, oh, I would like to be invited to that. How do I get in and or. So what I would say is really interesting about this is that it wasn't so much that the met ball changed. It's that I started getting younger clients. So like I have my old guard crew of clients who I've been with for a long time. And for them, the met ball was like, not important and something they occasionally saw obliged to go to because they had a relationship with a designer. I mean, most celebrities don't really enjoy doing the red carpet. It makes them anxious and looked at and it's hard. Yeah, it seems terrible. God, maybe maybe 10 years ago, I got some younger clients and they were all like, how do I get invited to the met ball? And I was like, whoa, you know what the met ball is because I thought of it as such like an insider, you know, like when I had my picture in the paper at the first time I worked at the met ball, my mom was like, what's that party? And like, where were you? Because it didn't mean anything. And now my mom will always text me the day before and say, are you dressing anyone for the met ball because she's seen it on the morning news that the met ball is happening today. Yeah. You know what I mean? Totally. In terms of the actual dresses or gowns or whatever your suits that you're choosing for this, are the rules different than red carpet than award shows because it's like themed or whatever? Do you how do you approach the sort of conceptual idea beforehand differently than you would for another big event? Definitely the theme is different. And sometimes we've just ignored the theme entirely. And sometimes I make a little nod to it. I guess I've done a few that are like really themed. Have you ever done like a really hokey thing? Yeah, I did address for Nina Dobros for a plastic 3d printed dress that Zach Posendon. It was like a clear plastic dress and she had to get a special seat like we ended call the PR girl and be like, she can't sit in a chair. She has to sit in a little stool that has to go under the dress. I can't wait. I'm sure Zach Posendon did address for this one since he has this big new job. And it's funny when I thought of that, I thought of he dressed someone and it was a light up dress. He's sort of the king of and he's perfect because he's like in the old world and the new world and all events, the celebrity world and he's like the king of those kinds of sort of. Yeah, I mean, his Charles James dresses are some of the best netball dresses ever. Right. I mean, where it just like it's totally on theme, but also totally beautiful. Yeah. You know, like sometimes the themey stuff, it's just like, oh, that's fun to look at. But it's like you're watching the party and hunger games where the people are going to the capital. Like it's just costume, right? It's like attention seeking costume. Like for me, I like it when it's like theme and also amazing fashion. Well, it feels like this year it's the Garden of Time or something. I don't know. But that seems pretty easy because you can like put some florals or it sounds like it could be pretty because it's not always pretty. First time I usually buy all the books and read them. But like one of my closest friends is an English professor at Princeton who specializes in the early novel all to give you context and say this woman where it reads the most boring stuff known to humankind. And I was waiting a meter for a coffee reading one of the netball books a couple of years ago and she walked in and she went, why are you reading that? And I was like, oh, it's in the netball book. And she was like, it's very outtake. And I was like, you know what? I'm done with these netball bibliographies. They're absurd. I don't know why they're so high minded. I wish they would dumb it down because then maybe people would read more books like people. It's true. Read more books. But these books that they recommend and stories are absurd. The one about America. Did you read that book? No, of course. It was about the birth of home and how originally in like 14th century people had a table in a room that they would put there to eat on and then they'd hang it on the wall and sleep on the floor. I mean, what does that have to do with anything? You know, this is a really good idea actually for them that we should whisper in their ears. They should do a Spotify playlist and they should do a reading list of fun books to get people in the mood. I mean, I really don't understand what the Garden of Time means. I'm really hoping there are a lot of pocket watches and things and people go too far with the clock theme. But yeah, I don't... It's interesting because it is... It's fun and you're supposed to remember that it's fun and it is a costume thing. But on the other hand, you just want people to look good. And sometimes they just look completely insane and you're just like, this isn't even... Sometimes it's entertaining and sometimes you're like, you didn't do it right. And it's that hitting that mix of being in on the joke and also looking great that is. But if you're cool like you, you can pull it off. I mean, I will say the one thing that's great about it. It's the only red carpet besides can that has steps. And that gives you... Like, steps are fantastic for pictures. And like, you know, when Rihanna wore that Chinese designer, that fantastic thing, it's like you couldn't do that. If you do that on a flat in front of a step and repeat, it's nothing. It looks like she brought her duvet to the show. But like those steps create a level of grandeur that's really like excellent for clothes. Yeah. It also, it would... I would fear tripping or something. Has Jennifer Lawrence tripped on those steps? I can't remember. I love this. I just, I don't know. That's the part that would scare me.

A lot of these people have contracts with different fashion houses. Many of your clients do because again, they are so high profile. You dress Michelle Williams, you have Julianne Moore now, right? She does. I don't know if she has a contract, but she's like very into fashion. So she has Botega. I sat behind her and her husband at the Botega show this year. They're so nice. I mean, he's the hottest man alive, but that's me. And I'm like equally as nice. But they looked great. True facts. They were so sweet. They were taking photos with some of the actresses from Asia and they were just so excited and they looked so good. It was really lovely. But anyway, you have people who have contracts or are dealing. Is the Met part of that usually or do you have a little more freedom? No, the Met is usually written into contracts because the brands commit so much money and they need to fill those tables. So yeah, it's written into contracts. Although like when you see that an actress on who's the face of a brand isn't at the Met, it doesn't mean it's a scandal. Their contracts always have provisions because if they're shooting movies, they can't leave productions to go to parties. So like I wonder about this year just because so many people are shooting now because this is sort of like the long tail of the actor's strike. You're seeing less people around right now because everyone is shooting a movie right now or a TV show. So I wonder if that will impact. I always think it's interesting too. Anna is such a Broadway fan. She's very clever. She put it on Monday, which is the one day Broadway stars have also week. It's very funny. Yeah. Because like Jeremy's on Broadway right now. But you can go to the Met on Monday. Well, lucky for him and us. Do you know what he's wearing yet? Or are you still deciding? No, I know what he's wearing. So you are you're already planned out that far. Do you ever do really last minute? I have. I did one really last minute dress years ago. And it's like one of the worst looks I've ever done. It was really, really hard. What you tell me what it is. No, I got pulled. I will not. It just I got pulled in by a publicist very last minute with a client I didn't know who was going with the designer I had never worked with before who was making the dress over the weekend. No weekend before the Met. And like the whole thing felt like it was sponsored by Michael's crafts. I mean, I was like, do I bring a glue gun to get her ready? Like, this is the craziest thing I've ever done. Yeah. Do you think it's more the Met is the most important of these events at this point? No, no, you the Oscars is still the most important. Well, I mean, for the people who are there, who are important, it's the least important. Everything else has meaning for them. Like most of the people there don't care about art and don't particularly care about fashion and may have never been to the Met besides this day. Like for them, it's just another picture. Yeah. And like, yeah, that's that. So like, it's hard for me to think of it as like a wildly important event because it's not for them. And I'm like in there or as you know, what I mean, like, they're, they're going to life changing events up and as they're on an awards run, you know, if you win an Oscar, even being nominated for an Oscar, it is a life, it will change their life. They will forever be Oscar nominated actress. So like going to the Met ball doesn't have that significance. And I don't think getting invited that does so much anymore because they invite so many people, you know, like there are influencers. Yes. Yeah, yeah, there's TikTokers there and just like that. So it's a real mix. Is it the most pleasurable for you? Oh, well, I go sometimes. Do you still go? Are you going this year? No, I don't think I'm ever going to go again. Because the problem with me going is that I work all day. So usually I get my hair and makeup done at like seven in the morning, and then I work all day, and then have to get ready like in five minutes. And like before I go to a party, I usually like to take a bath and like have a glass of wine and do my own makeup. And this is like a it's hectic. I don't feel attractive. And then there are pictures of me everywhere looking, you know, be draggled. I've seen you, you've been out and about lately. I saw you in a Lafayette 148 dress and you looked really, really good. And obviously you looked fabulous at Dior. You always look great. Thank you. Don't feel that way. But I understand. I also would not want to go. I did my own makeup for Lafayette 148, you know, like what a civilized person would do before going to a big party. You look great. Kate, this was so fun. Thank you for taking the time. I appreciate it. It was really great. Thank you. Fashion People is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck News, hosted by Lauren Sherman. That's me.
