I'm Lauren Sherman, the writer behind Line Sheet, Puck's private email about the fashion and beauty industries. Today I'm joined by T'Kun Panitchko. The famous fashion editor turned designer. In 2019, T'Kun returned to his editorial roots to launch Omegroes, a magazine about fashion, gender, and, well, charvet shirts. We talk about making magazines when magazines don't make sense anymore, making new clothes when new clothes don't make sense anymore, and lots of other stuff. Let's get started. Happy almost weekend, everybody. My fashion people. I'm actually recording this very, very early on Thursday morning in my London hotel room. You know, I can sleep when I'm dead. I'm about to jump on a plane to Savannah for the SCAD annual fashion show. But the last few days in London have been really good. I personally love talking about the weather, and Brits also love talking about the weather, and the weather here was glorious this week, especially today. I was actually trying to take a selfie against the blue sky, and my extremely cool coffee date who would never do that caught me in the act, and it was super embarrassing. I live in a state of perpetual embarrassment. It was funny. But yeah, the last time I caught up with you, since then I've published two line sheets, one on Wednesday that included my review of Gucci, which I would say I'm not down on, but I'm not also up on still waiting and seeing, which I think is a fair assessment. Tell me what you think. I'll publish the feedback. And then on Wednesday, my Puck partner, Rachel Struegatz, the beauty queen, also reported on Bella Hadid's not so great fragrance launch. I would say so, so not bad, not good. And it's really interesting. I'm not a model person. Like I don't generally care about models, don't care about the Hadid's only in certain contexts, but in this case, it was really fascinating. And some of Bella's investors or people I've covered also, including this guy, John Howard, who I've been writing about on and off for years. So it's a really, really interesting story. And I also did a little ode to Pam Drucker Mann, the chief revenue officer of Condé Nast, who resigned on Tuesday, kind of surprisingly. You should check out my partner Dylan Byers' piece in his Wednesday email in the room. He writes about media. It's very good. I know there are a lot of fashion people, our fans of Dylan's newsletter as well. And he also broke the news about Pam on Tuesday. So for the trade that suggested that they had the quote, unquote, exclusive announcement, keep telling yourself that we all know the truth. Dylan had it. Of course he did. He always gets it first. Anyway, you know, we love tracking Condé Nast. And I think Pam's exit was a pretty big surprise to the powers of B. I also don't think this means that the CEO, Roger Lynch, who we also write about a lot, he's a line sheet superstar. I don't think this means anything for him in the short term, maybe long term. I mean, Pam did a lot of work. So we'll see how he reorganizes and how he handles this. Oh, too much to say about Condé. Maybe we'll do a whole episode. There was also just so much. It was so, should I move to London? It was so fun here. I learned so much. I met with so many people. Also, many people I did not meet with, which is a bummer too. But I have a little bit of news about Fendi. There's some Burberry stuff in there and there's going to be a lot more on Monday. So I'm going to be on the plane tomorrow texting all of you or I'm going to be on. I was on the plane. I don't even know how to say that. It's Thursday morning. So I'm going to be on the plane in a few hours texting all of you. London was just so great. I had a great time. I had a good food. I got some scoops. It was just, it was fabulous.

The company can look it up since very early days and I'm a big fan and you should be too. Now let's get started with my interview with the one and only to come to come. Welcome to fashion people. Thank you. Thank you for having me. Thanks for being here. We were just discussing the pronunciation of your last name. I know I feel like nobody ever tries to. So it's it's panitchkole. Panitchkole. It's pretty phonetic actually. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah, it's just, I think that people, people, I don't know for whatever reason, I think with Thai names, people just kind of blank out and sort of don't think about the pronunciation. It's actually really phonetic. It's Sydney Prawa Yotun the same thing. Do you know him, right? For years. I was just like Sydney P and then I realized, oh, it's actually extremely easy. Hey, Sid, he'll never listen to this. But panitchkole. Well, I can't wait to say it when I when I set you up for this. I'm so happy to chat with you. I feel like we've known each other for a long time and this is going to be fun. My first question is, what did you have for breakfast? Oh my God. I had an egg over easy and a piece of toast. That sounds good. And a lot of coffee. That's a good carb to protein ratio. Yeah. I mean, today's Friday, so I do carbs on Friday just to kind of, you know, be playful. But usually it's eggs and then yogurt with some keto granola. Oh, wow. Keto granola, I'm into it. That sounds delicious. So congrats on the launch of the new issue. Can you tell me a little bit about it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're really excited. It's our volume 11, which it's kind of crazy that that we're here. We had our first male cover star, Troy Savon, for the issue, which, you know, I've been wanting to do to work with a male cover for a couple of seasons now. I just think that with Troy, it was the right timing. He's wanted to do the cover and he was really game. And I just think that, you know, as the magazine and as the brand continues to evolve from its original, I guess, brief admission and intent into something more of an attitude, I think that it's high time that we include, you know, men and all kinds of, you know, in the magazine. So the name is Ohm Girls. How did you come up with the name? Why were you driven by creating something that had a gender bent to it in this era where nothing is really gendered anymore? So it totally makes sense to have a guy on your cover, but it is called Ohm Girls. So can you talk a little bit about why you use that name and how it's evolved since you started a couple of years ago? I can't believe you said it's this is number 21 or number 11? Number 11, number 11. Number 11. That's still crazy. Yeah. You'd think it would be number five or something because it's gone so quickly. I came up with the name actually in 2018, even prior to any of this sort of gender discussion that was happening around COVID and etc. The name originated from the idea of, and you know this reference, in the 90s there were homegirls, which are these badass girls that are predominantly, I think, in the New York area, in the NYC area, who just sort of have this attitude of dressing where it was really about, again, just not giving a fuck about how they were perceived. There was a tomboy sensibility to it. A lot of the times they were appropriating menswear into their wardrobe, but it didn't really erase any sort of their femininity. It actually sort of made it a bit more complex and interesting. I've always subscribed to this sort of attitude. My formative years were in the 90s, and so I loved all of that energy. It was like the TLC moment, even in fashion, I think that a lot of the styling in the late 80s, Peter Lindbergh, Patrick de Marche Lié, Bruce Weber all had this kind of sensibility, which was a bit more masculine, but then also sexy. Homegirls started out as that, essentially, but then I was like, wait, what if it was Homegirls with 2M instead, and you literally lean into the menswear of it all for women? I thought that was a really clever name. I was like, I can't believe that it hasn't been out there. I actually went to GoDaddy and bought it for really cheap, actually. It was available. Homegirls.com was available. I was like, wait, this is meant to be. I started to embark on trademarking the name and really developing out the identity of it. You know, there are people who just buy domain names constantly. Are you one of these people? What are some of the other ones that you have? Tell me one. I can't tell you. If I tell you, then I would have to kill you. I have about six going right now. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. I think my husband, he used to have a lot. It wasn't. It was not financially viable. We had to get rid of them. It's a fun game. You know, some nights I would just sit there and just search on GoDaddy. It's actually really entertaining. It's your future businesses, so you can keep them a secret. When you started, OmGurls, you were, so 2018, were you doing your own brand now or was your namesake brand? Let's not call it eponymous brand. Nobody needs to stop using the word eponymous. Let's just ban it because no one uses it correctly. But were you working on your namesake brand at the time or were you on a hiatus? What were you up to when this idea came to you? 2018, I sold my namesake brand to a major investor in 2016. At that time, we were embarking on a new business model altogether, which you will remember. I believe that we spoke at that time. I think I had the exclusive to Koon. Exactly. Other people got mad because I had the exclusive. Lauren Sherman had the exclusive. I did. I did. For the record. I spent a lot of time in Hong Kong because we were setting up a headquarters in Hong Kong because at the time, it was really about this idea of seen-up by now. And so it had to be quick and fast. And so my investor wanted to have a hub there to be able to fulfill and such. And so that endeavor didn't work out. I think there were a lot of problems with the idea. I think that even for me, looking back, I saw those problems or I thought about those problems, but I believe that we were going to have the right people on the team to be able to execute and be nimble and work through those problems if they arose. But I think we sank way too much money into that endeavor. And so in 2017, I took a pause and a sabbatical and basically just traveled around and was like, I think I hate fashion. And then didn't know what else I wanted to do. And so I traveled, but then every time I went places, I still kept looking at fashion. I was still kind of engaged in what people were doing at the cities that I was in, but also on runway and just continuing to keep up with the ecosystem of fashion. And so I was like, I actually don't hate fashion. I just hated how my career at the time unfolded and I didn't want it to be the end of my career. Let's zoom out for one minute on the CNOW by now thing, because we're going to talk about the future of magazines, I promise. But for the uninitiated, in the mid-2010s, there had been a big shift in the culture to direct to consumer, which just meant selling directly to the customer. It's gone on forever, but away from multi-brand retail to owning your own stores or selling online because e-commerce, like post 2010, had boomed so much. So all of a sudden, all of the really big brands were like, we're going to sell in season directly to our customer, because usually the way retail works is that you make stuff almost a year beforehand, you sell it to a department store six months ahead of time. The department store makes a purchase and then it arrives in the store six months later. And when you do, it does arrive in the store winter, closer in summer and summer, closer in winter, and it doesn't make any sense. And it's a whole mess that's never going to get unwound. But in the mid-2000s, everybody thought it was going to get unwound. The issue was seen now by now, which means you're buying something, you're showing a collection. I remember, Takun, you did this amazing show on a rooftop in New York. It was so fabulous. It was such a great show. Very Omegirls, the styling of that show. So great. Which stylist did you use for that show? Do you remember? Alex Borneca. I worked with her for a number of years. She then went on to become fashion director for French Vogue and now she's at Alaya. Oh, she's at Alaya? She's amazing. That show was fabulous. But the point was that you could buy the clothes that were on the runway immediately. You didn't have to wait a year or six months or whatever. The problem with that is for every brand, unless you've been around for a long time and you're really liquid and you have a lot of profits, is that you have to buy all the product up front and you have to guess how much product to buy. And it's just not possible. It just doesn't work. And all of these brands, big and small, a lot of startups like yours, but also bigger brands like Tommy Hilfiger, Michael Kors, they all tried it and it's just really hard to actually execute. So that is an interesting thing because you had started your fashion career in the kind of mid-2000s when the traditional model and come up with this group of really talented young designers. You kind of went through all the different cycles of what modern fashion is until 2017 when you're trying to figure out, well, what is the next step? And it's interesting that Homegirls was the next step for you. Going back to what you just said about CinaBinau 2, I think that a lot of people overlooked the customers themselves. And I think that the psyche of the customer, especially in the luxury sector where you're buying $1,000 dresses, you need to consider that purchase. I don't think that there's enough people that can just spend $1,000 immediately when something comes out online right away. I think that even the people that I know that can afford to spend money on clothes take time to consider that purchase before they actually buy. They need to see it a couple of times. They need to think about it. They go into Barney's and they try it on and then they're like, oh, let me put it on hold and then come back for it. So we never considered the considered purchase of a garment and we just assumed that it was just going to be hotcakes. And I think that that, unfortunately, that came about because of social media. I think that that sort of like entertainment of fashion of it all on social media led to this idea that people, when they saw something, they needed to buy it right away. You're out on this trip. You realize you love fashion. You come up with a magazine concept, which you worked at magazines before you were a fashion designer. I actually have, I think I've told you, I have the issue of Harper's Bazaar with Britney Spears on the cover. She looks like Peter Marino. And you're on them. I mean, the people on that mass, mass head is crazy. It's all so many people are still in the business. It's wild. Like that was, I mean, I liked Kate Betts's Harper's Bazaar. I thought it was great. It was, it was short lived, but great and really culture driven. But so how did you end up in magazines and went from magazines to, to design back to magazines? How did that happen? I was a fashion baby. I consume magazines when I was 10 years old on, because, you know, at the time I'd moved to Omaha, Nebraska from Bangkok, Thailand, and there was really nothing to do except to go to the newsstand. And, you know, that's where I discovered all of the magazines. And then then then when I discovered fashion magazines, that was like it for me. And so I've always been obsessed with fashion. When I came to New York after college, I, you know, started at J. Crew, and then I had a PR, fashion PR job. And then a friend of mine who was working at Harper's Bazaar at the time said, Hey, there's a writing position opening in the fashion features department here. Do you want it? I was like, of course I want it. Wait, wait, backup. Which where did you work in PR? I worked for this designer, Coyote. And it was a really short PR stand. And I hated it. Well, and then you, and you got a fashion features as what year was this in like 1998 or something? It was 1999, right before 2000. This is literally you were living my dream. Because I was a junior, junior senior in high school dreaming of being Kate Betts and working at Harper's Bazaar writing features or whatever. It's really amazing. I was just telling what in my employees, my digital editor the other day, I just like recounting the stories of back then when magazines really were the epitome, especially at a fashion magazine. And then when Kate Betts was coming from Vogue to home Harper's Bazaar, you know, that was like the talk of the town, obviously. And so she recruited the best people to come work for her. And I was just, I was lucky, you know, I, again, I didn't want to be a writer, but I wrote well enough to get the job. And then I assisted Samira Nasser. I assisted Christina O'Neill. William Middleton at the time was there, who's now written many, many great books. We had a killer team of people. And I, you know, I was exposed to Melanie Ward, who was like an amazing, she's like, was everything at that time. Brian Wolfe, Michelle Botball. And I basically, you know, was assisting the fashion features department going out to social events with a photographer, writing from a book, articles. But then also, you know, I wanted to expose myself. Michelle Botball, I remember, was doing a big fashion portfolio and needed help on the weekend with like five top models. And I was like, of course, I'll come and help because I just wanted, I wanted in in fashion. And so for me, that that was really the sort of like the schooling that I needed to learn about high fashion. And then once I was there, I started meeting young designers because we were doing these profiles. And so I would spend time at their studios. I remember Bruce was a young brand that was coming up at the time. And I spent a lot of time at their studio. And I was like, wow, like they're great. Like what if they were their culture, their sort of their way of working, like their studio, like the environment was amazing. And that's when I really got into design. And so you built your own brand. You tried to re sort of reimagine it, that reimagining the execution was tough. You have this moment of what am I going to do? So you're like, I'm going to do a magazine. But did you know it from the beginning, you were also going to do product connected to it? Like what was your vision for Omegirls initially and how did that evolve over the last five or six years? I did know that there was going to be product. I think that, you know, everyone still now talks about how magazines are dead. But for me, again, being a magazine junkie and baby, I didn't see it that way. And I spoke to a lot of people who are young and old that who say, you know, they love magazines, it just has to be the right kind of a magazine that they would get into. And so I think that homegirls success comes from the fact that it's more of a universe, it's more of a platform of style. And it speaks very specifically to a certain sense of style. And I think that that is where a lot of niche magazines succeed. You know, fashion can't just be a big umbrella. And if you're talking about big umbrella fashion, like you might as well consume that information online. You know, I think that a magazine has to has to present itself as a point of view that's specific to a certain certain something. And we print it in the UK. It's beautifully printed. We have thoughtful storytelling inside. We don't always give out the content online. So we, you know, we encourage people to buy the magazine. And in the early days, girls would collect them. And like for me, I didn't even tell people that I was behind the magazine just because I didn't want any of my friends. I didn't want any people to have a preconceived idea of, oh, Takun was doing this, like all these feminine, floral, fun dresses. And now he's doing homegirls, which is a bit more masculine. Like I didn't, I didn't want people to know. And I just, and people discovered it on their own, which for me, like was really exciting. Again, talking about the universe of homegirls, I knew right away that we needed to do products to sort of balance out the the advertising revenue that was coming in, because I knew that advertising isn't the only stream of revenue and it can't be because it won't sustain itself.

I assume you were all really good friends previous to this, but how did you pull her in? When did she start and like how has that like what's the dynamic between the two of you? We weren't actually good friends. We knew each other. Yeah, we knew of each other, obviously in fashion. And she was hanging out. She hangs out in a different set of fashion circle than I do. So we overlap sometimes, but not that much. I met her. I saw her. I ran into her at a barber shop in the Lower East Side that I go to. And she was going there for her son and her husband's haircut. And so we started talking. And at the time I was looking to bring on a Creative Director. And so I was like, oh, let's have breakfast. And so I always think things like that happen for a reason. And when we started talking, it just seemed like the perfect fit. You know, I'm usually the person that can actually make quick judgment on people. Like I and decision very quickly. And you know, Jen, we all know Jen. We all know her style. You know, she's been she's a New Yorker through and through. She's got the coolest taste. Like, but aside from that, she's actually such a hard worker and really dedicated and really enthusiastic. And so for me, it's been a relationship of she's my sister at this point. It's interesting. Tooth. One is that your reputation for years. And I think I've written this before is that you are the hardest worker. Like when I would talk to me, they'd be like, that guy is in there first and he leaves last and he is the hardest worker of your whole. I mean, there are many. You have to you're going to have your own brand. You're going to have to work hard, but you have that reputation too. And the interesting thing about Jen, I met her because she lives in L.A. We live near each other now. So I see her around. But she is like the person that when you started this magazine, I know she wasn't involved at the very beginning. Was she or not in the beginning? She came on the third issue. So I worked with Jamie Perlman prior to. Also another cool girl, lovely, lovely person. But it's interesting because she, Jen is just so exactly the person that I imagine reading your magazine and like being a part of it. So it's an interesting, but let's talk a little bit about what, what you want. Who is this person is and also the word, the word that comes up for me is tomboy, which now I think might be like a charged term. I don't know because my kid, I have, I have a son, but I always think about like, I don't think you can call little girls tomboy's anymore. But and I was not a tomboy, but I love masculine clothes. So I, and I of course, like connected to it immediately. Like I, I dress. Like a boy, but I'm not a tomboy. I'm pretty girly girl. So it's an interesting, you, you captured that perfectly. But why was that sort of push pool between the masculine and feminine? So interesting to you. I think it's always been interesting to me. I think that we all have it in our DNAs. I think that it really speaks to, even for me, like I have femininity inside of me. I have masculine and I think that the balance is really nice. I think tomboy is triggering as a word these days, but at the same time, it's a conversation starter too. Like I think that, you know, yes, we can recognize that maybe that's just not correct politically these days, but you can't erase history and how it's been used in the past to describe this kind of an energy. So there is some sort of an energy there that exists, which is in all of us, the, the balance between feminine and masculine. Some have it more masculine, some have it less or more feminine. And so for me, I think that that's, that's the, that's the success of the magazine and of the brand is just that it speaks to people so innately, especially in the beginning, people immediately were commenting like, Oh my God, that's me. I'm a homegirl. And so I didn't really have to spell it out that much. I just basically showcase the attitude and the POV and the styling that we all loved. And so, you know, there might not be the right terminology these days, but the energy remains. Applying that same philosophy to the product, what were the first things you made? And we just talked a little bit about distribution and how that all changed in fashion. How did you approach distributing the product in the beginning? What were your thoughts given all the knowledge you had for years of having your own business and different iterations? How did you think of product in terms of concept and then also distribution? It was quite methodical the way that I thought about products and actually everything that we did, just because I wanted, I wanted control. You know, I felt like when I was leaving to coon behind, to coon the brand behind, at a certain point, I just didn't, like we had so many employees and I didn't under, I didn't even know what they were doing or working on. And so with this iteration, I was like, this is a passion project. I want control of everything because I want to know the numbers. I want to know what sells. I want to know who's doing what I was fulfilling. I'm still fulfilling. And so the idea of it all was to kind of really keep it tight, like almost like a mom and pop situation. And so the first product that I designed was a white shirt. Just because that was really, for me, like the white shirt is like a blank canvas, so to speak, but it also signifies a lot. Simply put, it signifies a lot about sort of like what the world of homegirls could be. So it served as like the first item. And then I remember we were starting to distribute the magazine and Kith wanted to buy the magazine. And so we had it in the, in the store and they were like, oh, this is really cool. Like we do like a product collab. So like very early on, they wanted, they were the first people that wanted to, to do a product collab. And I said, absolutely. You know, what do you have in mind? And he was like, I don't know, like maybe just like a shirt or something. And so that's how we came up with the crop shirt. And then we put the Kith logo on it and, and that took off immediately. And so it was a crop button up. It was crop button up in white. And then we did it in chambray blue as well. And how did it just sell out so fast? It's all out so fast. I even at my years at Takoon, I never cut that many pieces of clothing. And so to this day, we sell our shirts very well. We sell our boxer shorts really well. And the boxer short came about because we wanted to do something to pair back to the shirt. And so every piece of clothing that was introduced there after had to relate to the one existing before. And so that's to me, the best way to create a capsule is to really think through all of the pieces that can work together. I don't ever, ever want to go back to the time when we were designing 300 styles and putting shit down the runway that didn't produce or didn't mean anything after a season. When you say you never cut so many, you mean that you never sold so many of the same style. That's incredible. Yeah, exactly. So, you know, we in the in the in the beginning, when we launched the shirts, like we were we were cutting in terms of units, 1500 plus per style. Amazing, which is unheard of in luxury fashion, by the way. Yeah, that's incredible. And you started with Keith, but then you moved you ended up at netta portee pretty quickly, correct? Or where who was your next? Who was your next retailer? And how did you manage that relationship versus the way you did it when you were in a traditional fashion brand? So those relationships are really complicated. Obviously, I write about them constantly and the challenges these these retailers have, but they're still important to developing a brand. So I also have on board Stacey Caldwell, who was my VP of wholesale for many years at Takoon, and we she knows me inside and out like she knows exactly what I want. She she can express my feelings and she's very, very good with partners, with retail partners. And so I brought her on early on in at Homegirls as well. And so we decided together that this was going to be a brand marketing endeavor at first and that we were not going to open it up to any any just anybody. And we were going to slowly and methodically just start to introduce people into the brand organically. And so when we launched with Keith, other people started to see the product. And of course, they they would come requesting and we edited them. And then the next one was Browns. Holly Rogers was at Browns at the time and said, actually DM'd the the Homegirls account and was like, Oh, my God, we're loving what you're doing. Can we have a meeting to carry the collection? And I DM'd her back and I said, Hey, hey, Holly, it's Takoon. And she she kind of freaked out because she she had no idea that I was behind it. And so we had a discussion in New York and then she started carrying the collection. And Neta Porte came a year after that. It is interesting. I didn't realize you you didn't want people to associate it with you because of you were you were known for like, I remember one collection you did. I want to say it had pajama. It was just really good. And I remember leaving and Stefano Tonke being like that show was so good. And it was just like that was such a good show. And there was a cool space, but you were known for more feminine clothes. But your clothes always had like such a sophistication and deafness to them that when you did start to be more interested in, it was more that it felt like to me more of your everyday clothes were going to be this. So it made sense that your fancy dresses looked one way. And the person who would wear your everyday clothes would still wear those designs that you did. When people discover that I did homegirls, they actually were like, wow, that actually makes sense. We can actually see the through line between to coon to homegirls. I'm just dialing up the simplicity a little bit more and the print and the colors obviously go away at this point. Again, coming back to the retailers that we wanted to work with, simply we wanted to use them as marketing sort of adjacencies, right? Like to basically set the tone for what the brand could be. So we were still very picky with the people that we want to add to the table because ultimately I think that to be able to, for me, being independent is the best feeling and to be able to, on the magazine side and on the product side, to be able to just dictate and do whatever I really feel like doing without any sort of restraint or feeling like you're risking a relationship or you're not making numbers. Like I don't even have a business plan. We don't operate like that. I think it's just really about intuition and just knowing that, OK, you know, like if we're bringing in the right partners, if we're putting out the right content, if we're making the right products and if we're selling through very well, like these are the benchmarks that sort of give us insight into how we behave next year. So no investors yet. No investors, completely independent. And on the advertising side, I remember really early, you did a whole issue with Chanel. Is that right? And it was fabulous. It was so good. We were so lucky. How did that even come about? How did you come up with that concept? Did they approach you? Did you approach them? And what were you thinking when you went into that? Because I thought it was brilliant. I love when editorial connects super closely with the advertiser, because that's what's happening behind the scenes anyway. Let's just put it out front. But how did you approach it? So that was, I think, our fifth or sixth issue, actually. And it was a confluence of things. I think that relationship was like was a key player in this. Jen had has long standing relationships with Chanel. I have friendly relationships with Chanel team members as well. And so we kind of basically were in talks with them. And when they saw the magazine, they were really excited by the energy of it. They wanted our POV. And they wanted, I think that it's such a youthful energy that they wanted to express. And so when they came to the table at the time, we had maybe two or three advertisers that were coming slowly to the magazine. And so it wasn't a hard decision to be like, OK, we're going to give Chanel the entire issue just because they were coming to the table with such a healthy proposition. And so they gave us access to couture, to high jewelry, to ready to wear, to fine jewelry, to beauty, to everything. And so, you know, and to their talents as well. Right. Like so like nobody, everyone wants to work with Chanel. It's it's really a dream brand to work with. So really, it was quite easy. But I think that looking back, it was a confluence of just like really personal relationships. Have you done an issue like that again? We haven't just because now we have a lot more advertisers on the table. And so what we try to do and we have done special one-offs where, you know, if a brand wants to come in exclusively, we'll offer them a zine format, for example, or, you know, just like a smaller format that that can come out in between the times that the biennial has come out.

Visit helloalma.com to get started. That's hello, a l m a dot com. Helloalma dot com. What kind of content do you put in those? Can you give examples of, like, great pieces that were featured in one of those zines or in the Chanel issue? Because, look, I mean, that was several years ago now, but I just remember thinking, oh, these articles are actually good, too. It felt good. It didn't feel icky in any way. But can you explain a bit about how you approach editorial with these sponsored things and make it as interesting as the editorial are doing in a straight-up editorial? Yes, I think that what we try to do is we try to give a fresh perspective to any brand partnerships that we bring to the table. And what I mean by that is I think that there is a formula that a lot of magazines use to kind of just plug and play with brands, thinking that the audience will just receive it the way that they're used to receiving it. But for us, we kind of question that process a little bit more and dig a little bit more and say, OK, but are we bored by that? And if we are, what are the different angles that we can bring to this that make it feel fresh? You know, we just did a Ferragamo partnership that was quite beautiful, actually, where we then had Durga Chubos. Incredible writer who worked at Essence for a long time. Exactly. I love what Essence is doing. They're killing it right now for me, I think. But Durga wrote a fashion fiction to accompany the imagery. And it was beautiful. And I think that that's the kind of organic, thoughtful sort of studies that we try to do for every single partner. Totally. I just got off a call with a luxury brand and we were just talking about the future of the industry. And the two things that I said were everybody wants to shop in a store, but no one shops in stores. And everybody wants a magazine, but nobody reads magazines. I think you're right that a niche magazine is a little different of a proposition. And that's why if you look at GQ, for instance, they've sort of become a niche magazine. Mass magazines don't work anymore. Mass retail doesn't work. But people are desperate to go shopping. Had this conversation last night, everybody talking about it, there's no store for me. There's nowhere to go shopping. And then the same thing, like there are these publications that people really love, but how many people are actually reading physical material? How do you see as someone who is selling a product that gets sold in physical retail and making a physical product for people to read? Where do you see it all evolving at this point? I'm going to let my basic sort of intuition of what I want drive where we go. And I think what I do want is I still crave a physical presence for a retail. Like you're right. Like I don't think that there is a store that I'm like that I see in New York right now where I'm like, oh my God, like this is like the Mecca, the way that I used to think that Barney's was the Mecca. And I crave that. I go into galleries or I go into a bookstore and when I flip through and discover a magazine, I enjoy it. So like I let these emotions inform what I think my peers would want. Because I think that that's like the common thread that we're all missing right now is that there's too much digital and we crave the social and the physical element. So for me, I think next step is looking at a physical presence in New York, just because I think that that will give us such a good expression of what homegirls can really be. And then maybe that's a case study to kind of replicate. Would you want to sell other brands in there too? I would love to. And I and and that is something that I think about a lot because it is again, it's a universe. You know, I think that we talk so much into this niche of hope like men's wear for women. But within that niche, there's just so many different worlds or different satellites, different moons that can come from this one singular niche. You know, you can talk about bespoke tailoring. You can talk about, you know, street wear like tail, street wear style. You can talk about 70s homegirls. You can talk about 80s or 90s homegirls. So just there's just so many different facets that can live in this world. Final question. What designers are you loving right now? Well, you mentioned Alaya. I am obsessed, so I have a feeling you might be too. But I love Alaya. I just was at this dinner that they had last night, this small dinner, and it was really fascinating. It was what they're doing is very, very considered. I said to the CEO, you know, it's very respectful of of as a dean. And I think Peter is doing an amazing job there. She is also Miriam. She's so chic. She has beautiful hair, but also she just looks so good in the clothes. She's the perfect, perfect person to be running, running that brand, to be the business partner for Peter. It's what they're doing is, you know, I sympathize or I relate to just because again, it does feel very considered. And it feels like you're running a mom and pop in a bigger scale, obviously. But mom and pop meaning that you invite people into your space and you are considered about everything, you know, from like sort of the menu, from like the thank you notes that you send out afterwards, like and everything in between. You know, and I think that that's the approach that I like to take at homegirls. And so yeah, I think as a dean, Alaya is really beautiful right now. I love this brand, Hoda Kova, that's coming out of she's Swedish. She basically takes old menswear and found objects and creates one of a kind pieces with them. And they're very stunning. Amazing. Well, I'm going to I've I've looked at her stuff before, but I'm going to do a little online perusing after this. She did a Gucci interpretation as well. That was really beautiful. Takun Panitchko. Did I say it right? You did. You did. Well done. Thank you for being here. It was so fun to have you on Fashion People. Thank you so much. Love speaking with you always. Always.
