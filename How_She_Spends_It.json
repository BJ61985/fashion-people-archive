But I hope you enjoy the conversation and learn something anyway. And I hope to see many of you in New York next week. Morgan Stewart-McGraw, welcome to Fashion People. Thank you so much. I'm so excited. I'm going to hear that, and by the way, and I'm going to hate how I said that. I always do the thank you so much, but we're here. I'm excited. You know, I'm from a place called Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I don't know if you've ever been there, but the way people speak there, and I think it has to do with there's like something to do with, I want to say, Scottish or something, some background, and they uptalk. So at the end of sentences, and I still do it, but when I went to college in Boston, not Harvard, I just went to a regular school. But you know when people are like, I went to school in Boston and you're like, F off. I know where you went to school. No, I really just went to school in Boston. But they would make fun of me constantly because I'd be like, are we going there? Or like, instead of at the end, it always sounds like a question. So I understand. There's all, we all have our weird stuff. I also wish I had a cooler story to go with it, but mine is just like straight anxiety. There's no brown, nothing. Well, you know, you wear it well. Thank you. I boosted it. First question, what'd you have for breakfast? Oh my God, this is all I think about. I had scrambled eggs, a side of blueberries, and a piece of toast. It's a perfect meal. Yeah, I need it. I was just thinking about this this morning because I skipped breakfast because I went to the Do-en fundraiser. Yeah. And ate a very small amount of food because it was at Genghis Cohen, which I'd never been there. It was fun. Okay. There was Adam Brody was there. He is a delight. He is way hotter in person. Like he is not my, that's not my vibe. And I like, I think he's cute, but I, but he's really cute in person. No, I feel like he's really cute on camera and in person. I feel like across the board. Yeah, he's doing very well. But I had like a butterfly, a butterfly deep fried shrimp and some low-main and that's it at like 9pm. So I was still hungry. It was not enough food, but I was like, you know, I'm not going to have breakfast. But the thing I was thinking about was the fact that I love toast and scrambled eggs. Like that's my, I could eat that for every single meal. That's your, is that your everyday breakfast? When, yeah, I, I tend to, or, or my lunch, it depends. If I eat really late at night, I won't eat breakfast. But if I eat at 5pm, then I have breakfast, that type of thing. But do you feel like your eating habits post having a child have changed? Like I am in a position where like, if I don't eat breakfast, I'm, the ambulance is being called by 11 o'clock. Like I cannot function without food. And before I had kids, I could have gone two days, no food. Yeah. I, I think that my habits have changed in that I really love eating dinner early. And so the fact that he wants to eat dinner at five, I'm on board and we try to eat as only child. So we're, we try to eat as a family and my husband would eat at like 830 if it were up to him. And I'm like, it's 515. We got to get going. We've got to get this meal moving because this kid's getting annoyed and he's going to end up eating a bunch of crap before dinner if we don't eat now. So yeah, it's interesting how, and your kids are, you said four and two? They're going to, yeah, no, they're going to be, Ro is going to be three in fact, no, I've already fucked up how old she is, how old is she going to be? She's going to be four in February and Gray is going to be three in February. They're literally the year on the day. So she's the 16th and he's the 17th. Oh wow. So Irish twins almost. Literally. That's why I have to have breakfast now. I understand. Yeah. That's the whole thing. But I do feel really good that you have the same family dynamic because my husband is the same way. I guess it's like a man thing. Dinner at 830 to me is not, it's like not ethical. Like I, there's not a shot in hell I'm eating dinner at 830. No, when I'm in Europe, I do it, but I really only eat dinner. Like I do, you know what, you know, when you're traveling for the shows and stuff, like it's just so, I'll eat at like 10 o'clock at night there. And then for the rest of the day, I'm like, oops, I forgot to eat something, which doesn't affect you. It doesn't affect you. Nothing counts there. There's no hangovers. You can have a hundred cigarettes. It doesn't matter. No. This is not a video. The video is never going to live, but I do notice some bags in the background. Is that a background or is that your real bag? This is real life. Oh my God. It's amazing. Well, this is all just to really like make it, and then there's a new one up there that I have in unpacked. So these, I had this case made because I had no room for any of these bags. So these are my size 25 Birkins and mini Kelly case. So all my 35 Birkins and my Hawks live in my main closet. So this is just for like the babies. And then I have on top, there's like some Chanel, if you can see. I love it. It is a piece of art. Thank you. It really looks so good. It really works. And it was really actually just more, it was less of a display case and more for functionality, but it's kind of giving both. Do you have a favorite of these 25 inch? Yeah, I'm going to show it to you. Show me. I have, it's a Kelly though. It's not a Birkin. And I haven't worn this one, which is, this is a disservice. We have this Matt Gray Birkin, my favorite. Oh, wow. It's beautiful. This 25 or excuse me, 28 brick Kelly box. Oh man. My favorite with the white stitching. I figured you'd appreciate this one. This is a special bag. You know, I just did the Proust questionnaire with Monica, who has like a fancy French last name, who's based in Paris, who's Canadian. And it's the fashion Proust questionnaire. And it said, what would you, if you were going to come back as a luxury item, what would you, or a fashion item, what would you come back to back as an, I said, a red Kelly. There's, this is, I would give every single one away and just keep this one above all the skins about everything. There's just, because you know, the more beaten up, it's just like one of those, it's just a beautiful product. So good. Thank you. I love you with this one. So Morgan, how did you get so into Hermes bags? Like who are you? How did, how did you, how did you come to be a fashion person? I feel like I've always been a fashion person. I know that that's such a weird answer, but like, my mom is a fashion person. I grew up around it. It's just literally something that has like been ingrained in me. Like clothes have always been really important. Like they've always been a priority. It's not something that was ever like an afterthought. Like clothes were prioritized and looking good was prioritized in terms of just like good taste, not in terms of like plastic surgery or a certain image. And so I feel like I was born with it. And I was also just, I was heavily influenced by my surroundings and the people that raised me. And that was just something that was the thing, the Hermes. I feel like when I was 25, it was just really popular and it was impossible to get one. Like it's not like now it's still impossible, but for some reason, every single person and their mother has one, they're kind of, it's almost starting to like turn a bit. Like the mini Kelly is like, it's like, you kind of cringe a little bit. Like, are we really going to wear these still? And I got, I was in Switzerland in Stodd for Christmas break and I somehow managed to get my hands on a brown 35 because I begged and I was like, that was it. I was hooked. And the 35 was like the size to have at that point. It was like 10 years ago. And I guess since the last few years, I've just sort of started collecting, but it's almost just like happened. It wasn't, I didn't set out to do it. Yeah. And I do think if you're going to collect a fashion thing, that is the thing or Chanel jackets. And that's another thing. But these are things that you can really become a connoisseur of them in the same way people collect, I don't know, cigars or whatever. It's a similar thing. Right. Or rocks. I mean, everyone cuts something. And these, I mean, I think at the smartest part is that obviously it's such an investment. I mean, I could flip any of these bags for like triple the amount I paid for them. And I'm a connoisseur in the sense of like, I love them. I'm emotional about them. I buy them if I like them, but I'm not like this is, you know, this color and this size, like if somebody brings something out and I like it, I like it. And I forget all the facts about it. Like I am not like things aren't in the box and they don't have the stuff around them. And I'm like, I know this one's called brick because I remembered, I couldn't tell you any other color behind me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, like it just sort of is. Well, this is what they say about art. It's kind of like you're supposed to just buy the stuff you like and not worry about what the value is or what the context like you're just supposed to buy what you like. And if you do that, then you do, they do end up creating value. Unless you're really bad taste, but we don't. We don't. So you grew up in Los Angeles. Yes. I grew up in LA, born and raised, went to school here my whole life. What do you think in terms of your personal style and also the way you think about fashion, how did that inform your way of being? Well, this is the thing I hate to always like bring up my mom and go back to that. My mom is not American. So I feel like I do. Where is she from? My mom is Swiss. So like she was like in Jules Sander my whole life. Like that was sort of like that. Like I grew up. We were going to Barney's. It was like her Jules Sander was my row. Yes. Totally. Or like there was some Etro or a crease or like just all of these sort of like, you know, different Chanel pieces sprinkled in. And so I kind of followed in those footsteps where I don't feel like I have such LA style, except for the fact that like I wear jeans basically every single day. And I don't feel the need to get dressed up all the time. But yeah, I guess my LA style is really just sort of how California and I am and the fact that like I wear jeans everywhere. It's like I'm casual, but it's not really, you know. Yeah, you're really polished. And Oh, please, you know, you look great every day, but you are very polished, but not in. It doesn't feel forced. It's very, it just feels like that's who you are. And so you always look really put together. And I know what you mean. I was looking through my closet today because I'm going to a couple of holiday parties and I realized I really, my closet is I have really nice clothes, but it's jeans now. And it's not and it's yeah, and there's just I have dresses and things, but they don't feel appropriate for here. So especially going out at night, unless you're going to a really fancy thing, it's a little bit odd to dress, get dressed for here. I think that's a huge reason high sport has been so popular here because it's the sort of medium between wearing jeans and like a like kind of yeah. Yeah. And I think that that is sort of the thing that's sort of depressing here because you always feel a bit overdressed. But then if I'm like in New York, I'm like, I have nothing to wear. I know. Yeah. It's really tricky. And then I have a 4,000 pairs of slacks, but then I'm like, do I want to wear baggy slacks that only look good in jeans? Like there's just some holes. Yes. That I'm struggling with. I think the trouser situation in fashion is not great either. There are, I have the same issue. I have tons of pants, and I don't even end up wearing them when I go to New York, even though I buy them for New York essentially. But then when I get there, I'm like, I think I actually am just going to wear jeans all day. I know. I know. I really, I just appreciate having these conversations so much because these are the things that take priority in my brain. And I'm like, you should probably think about something else. And all I do is stare at like these mountains of clothes in front of me. And I genuinely sometimes I'm like, I'm so overwhelmed by that I just like put something, like the thing that's on the floor on and I just go on about my day. And I keep trying to solve the problem. And it's making it worse. I think Lauren Sandron Domingo was just on this new podcast that Harper's Bazaar is doing called The Goodbye. And she actually had a lot of very pragmatic shopping advice, even if you are not buying the robe boots and whatever coat she suggested, which sound fabulous. It is a luxury maxi. But what she said that I was really helpful for me was she does, it's not even the one in one out roll, which I do try to do. She does one in two out. I know that is wild. That is a really big commitment. She was talking about black sweaters. And I've just recently bought several black sweaters because I feel like I don't have the right one. And I thought, Oh, I really do need to get rid of the other ones. If I'm gonna keep keep, I still haven't found the right one, to be honest. Okay, well, you don't, not even to do shameless plug, but like you don't have the wrangly crew neck, like thin cashmere sweater. I need to get it. No, that is, I'm not, I made that sweater for this exact purpose because I could not find the right sweater. It will solve your problems.

So how did you end up, you went from being a fashion collector and a fashion person to being a fashion designer and a fashion entrepreneur. Tell me about your journey, Morian. How did you get from here to here, from there to here, there to there? To be honest with you, I really feel like it was just sort of destiny. I don't even know if there was a journey. I did a reality show in 2014 called Rich Kids at Beverly Hills. I don't know if you watched it. I don't watch reality television. But I love the concept of it. Who else was on it with you? I feel like the people, the vibes were good on this television. It was a great, it was a great, I mean, look, I never watched it when it was on and I can barely watch it now. But it was with my friend Dorothy Wang, who was kind of the originator of the show. Like she, it was her sort of like they basically came to us together, but she was the one that spearheaded it. And, and then some other kids, I like another friend of mine, this girl, Roxy, just like we were a group of friends, we grew up Beverly Hills together. It was fantastic. I was always like really into fashion, war fashion on the show, consistent to the fashion I wear now. And then I think it was like my third season and somebody approached my agent to do a line and it ended up being a sportswear line. And so I did active wear for like five years. So that was amazing and really successful. And I did like, I hate to say this, but I was like the first person to do like seamless leggings, truly. And I think, and then it just sort of became like, you know what I'm, you know what that means? Yes. Yeah. It was like, it's like the high-waisted seamless leggings. I was doing them in a bunch of different colors. And so I did that for five years. We had some unbelievable pieces that I still like wear and people really loved it. And then that fell to shit. And then I continued, the show ended two years after the clothing line ended. I went to go work at E and I did their nighttime show, daytime show, and then a bunch of digital shows for them. And then in 2022, that ended. And I think it was like a few months later, and then somebody put me in touch, my agent put me in touch with my business partners that do Wrangly now. The La Crosse Boys. The La Crosse Boys who we love. We love the La Crosse Boys, Max and Xander. Guys, come on the pod. Come on the pod. Can you imagine they'll be like, oh, mumbling the whole time. Oh, but no, no, no. They're wonderful. And we were, we did that deal and it just that, it just worked out. When you say it went to shit, what happened? Was it just like, not a great situation? It was not a great situation. And the people that I did it with, it just sort of, it really just fell to shit, to be honest with you. And it was, it was probably time to move on. And Wrangly always existed in my brain. Like I, at like 16, I was like, I'm gonna have a brand. It's gonna be called Wrangly. I don't know how that's gonna happen, but that's just gonna happen. And then it happened. What is, what does the name, is it like a surname? What does the name mean? So it's my mom's maiden name. Okay. It's my middle name and it's my daughter's middle name as well. And I actually hated the name growing up. I was like, you know, to use this, I was like, why can't my middle name be Molly? Like, why do I have to say this name out loud? Like this is fucking crazy. And when they approached me and I was working on this deal, I was like, it has to be called Wrangly. And it, I think it fits perfectly. It's, I love it. It's such a, it's such a great name. And what did you want to do? Like what was, especially after you had this experience that wasn't, it was good in some ways and not good in others. What was like sort of your vision for what you were going to put together? I mean, I wanted to make wearable clothing that like was my exact taste and to go back to the point of like filling the holes in my closet and just sort of like, instead of buying it, like making things that I need, like that black sweater we talked about, like we came out our first season, it was a black sweater, a yellow sweater and a beige sweater and this like very fine cashmere because I could not find that. I couldn't find it. And that was the sweater that I wanted to wear, like for a lunch meeting with a t-shirt underneath and then also kind of wear it as a blouse to dinner and sort of be able to like fit both of those roles. So just sort of paying attention and creating the sort of detail and clothing that I was lacking was really important to me. I feel like that's just something like there's a different variation, a million variations of things, except for the thing you want. Yeah. Always. You know what I mean? It's always like so like shopping for me lately, especially has become challenging. Yeah. And I'm really fortunate where I can buy a lot of what I want and I'm like, what is this crap? Yeah. Yeah. I think that's how a lot of people feel right now. Yeah. And because the thing is the luxury industry has been relying on people like you who can buy stuff. Right. And if you're not satisfied, they're really screwed. There's just no attention to like, I feel like I'm going to all of these high luxury, first of all, I'm going to most of these luxury brands because there is no multi-brand store anymore that I can walk into and find or discover like a lesser known brand that's Japanese or something cool where I can pick an item up that like not everybody has. Like that does not exist. And it used to. So that's also really depressing. And then I'm kind of getting fed all of these different things. Like somebody from Gucci just messaged me a bunch of dresses and I'm like, I'm never wearing that dress. Yeah. You know, so it's kind of sad. Yeah. Because you also actually have taste. Whereas a lot of people, they're betting, this is the thing, they are betting that people don't have taste and that they'll do whatever they say. But the problem is everybody has taste and is has developed their taste because they've been consuming the stuff for the last 20 years. And so now there, there aren't options. Why did you decide to do something like the prices are very reasonable? The sweaters are like 400 bucks for a cashmere sweater or whatever. It's not, it's not cheap. It's not like, no, it's, quince.com or something, but it's not, it's not crazy expensive. Why did you decide on that price point? Because I wanted things just simply to be appropriately priced. I think the inflation of some of these pieces as my light dies. Thank God this isn't being reported. Kind of chic though. It's very chic. I just feel like it was so inflated. Like it genuinely was like unethical. Like this is not $4,000 worth of merchandise. Like you need to, we need to stay in reality a little bit. And I think for me, it was really important for my consumer to trust me and get a piece of clothing from Wrangly and be like, holy shit, like this is legit. Like they have done their research. She has sourced this material. She is most importantly going to wear this. Right? Like Mary Kay and Ashley, like they're wearing some of the row, but it's really hard to really love the thing. It's like, I've said this before, but when you make dinner for someone, you don't really want to eat it. You're like, I snack the whole time. Like I prepared it for someone else when it's time to eat your over it. And that's the same thing with, I think if you make clothes, but so that's why with Wrangly, I was really specific that the stuff was stuff I was going to wear. And what, I know that it, you do a drop and stuff sells out immediately, but what has the reaction been? And you have a lot of followers on Instagram. I don't know if you're on TikTok because I never go on there, but I'm sure you're doing it. But you have, I mean, that's a built in audience. So people are going to be interested, but like, what has the feedback been? And what did you learn in the first, I mean, you've only been doing this for what two years? No, not even. It's been a year. It was a year in September. Yeah. And the feedback has been honestly unbelievable because I think like we really cared. I really cared. And I wanted to make sure that like, I am not going to sell to the audience that has watched me for the last 12 years, put different clothes on that's been consistent, right? Like I didn't have that big of a difference taste 10 years ago than I do now. And I wanted them to kind of be able to trust that. So when they started to get stuff in the mail, they were like, Oh, you weren't playing. Like you really, you really showed up and you really made sure that this was going to be an extension of your actual taste and point of view. So it's been great. So I want to talk about your career as an, the interesting thing is maybe it's because I met you via Wrangly and obviously I knew who you were, but I didn't think of you as a traditional influencer. And perhaps it's because you did reality TV, you did presenting, as they would say in the UK, I don't even know what they would call it here. You've done all these different things. What did you want to be when you grew up? And how would you define your career as someone who gets paid to post about stuff and who influences other people's choices and like shopping decisions, that sort of thing. I think, well, the thing is the funniest thing is that I like barely get paid to post about stuff. And I think my career, what I wanted to be when I grew up first of all was I always wanted to be on television. That was number one. You're sort of like fashion girl. It's always been in the background of how people knew me and now it's at the forefront. Like in this last year, I think it's really changed with Wrangly and just, I think people who have been following me for many years have been like, oh, she's always been that girl, but it's just I have more of a presence in the fashion space like where people are. You know who I am. But for me, TV has always been the forefront of my ambition and my interests. And this is actually the first time in my entire time kind of being in this world or in this business where I don't have a television show. I don't have a podcast. Like I don't have an actual vehicle that people can come to every single day aside from my Instagram or my TikTok where they can come and see like the personality side of me, which is actually the largest part of what makes me who I am. And I totally forgot the second part of the question. So I hope I answered some of it. No, that was it. That's really interesting. And it's interesting to know. So like when you look at the makeup of the MSM enterprise, the part of it where you're getting paid to post and doing content partnerships or sponsored posts or brand partnerships, that's a small part of your overall business, the business of you at this point. That is something that like I will take those on if it makes sense. And like I really do feel passionate about what I'm doing. And I'll obviously like link things that I'm wearing just to kind of, you know, I know people are interested. So I'll do that. But in terms of like actual content posting, I'm not really doing that as much as I probably should or could. And so yeah, I think the I think I've said this also before, but like, I'm not an influencer. I'm just influential. I think people really trust that I'm not going to bullshit them. And I am who I am no matter what, like it's not like, oh, we're doing this style this season. So I'm jumping on top of that. Like we're going to do the same version of me no matter what. Yeah, I think you're more of a personality. I appreciate that. Then you weren't like outfit posting 12 years ago, right? Like that was, did you have a blog or anything? Yeah, I mean, I had a blog called boobs and lubes, which was very yeah, it was, it was epic. It was epic. I was like so obsessed with all the different Louboutins. I bought all of them. I had a blog that was really personality based. I definitely have posted, I mean, most of my Instagram is me in different outfits. I think it was heavier like a few years back. And now I've just gotten less interested in posting in general because I don't know, retired with kids. Yeah, you have a life and you have about five different other jobs. Yeah, it's interesting because every in some ways everyone is an influencer, right? Anyone who has an online or public persona at this point. So you see it in celebrity and you see it with actors and musicians. Same kind of thing. They have to choose how much they want to do that stuff. And then there are the people who sort of have built an entire business around that specifically. And I think that's when it gets tricky because if your whole life is doing these outfit posts or whatever, like you have to evolve it and a lot of them aren't able to or you know, maybe they don't want to, but it's an interesting thing. How much are you thinking about like, I just said the MSM enterprise, but like what are your kind of ambitions for what all the different things you want to do like TV, podcasts, what else? I mean, for me, I think like I've really enjoyed the last year of just being able to focus on Wrangly because I do think a lot of why it's been so good is because I've had the time and space to like send back and forth thousands of different fabric samples to make sure we have this shit off the ground. And but TV for me, I think like is in the future. I think that that's going to align when it's meant to. And I think it's TV. I think it's continuing to build Wrangly. I don't, I've always said this, I don't want to do a podcast, of course, like cut to me in six months having to do a podcast, because everyone is like, do a fucking podcast, just have one. But everyone has a podcast. Do I really need to pile on and also have one? Like I'm also really good on camera. Yeah. And everyone, you know, not everyone can get out of just like a little box and actually like Harry stuff. So that's kind of the main, the main goal again. I guess the other thing is how much money most people don't make a lot of money off podcasts. Which not that, not that that should be the driver, but if you're not interested in it. Why do it? And even if it becomes fairly popular, like there are very few that are going to get the call, call her daddy money. You could probably do it. But I think if I were to build a podcast, I could probably get there. And I mean, she is, I love her. I've gone on her show. I've spent time with her. She's amazing. And she's definitely the real deal. But yeah, I just think like the right opportunity will present itself and it probably won't be a podcast.

You know what? I think I just, I'm so happy we get to talk about all the things that just occupy my brain all day long. When I grew up in LA and not just like Beverly Hills, like I'm talking Malibu, just like the whole, all the different areas. It was magical. It was truly like such a special place. Like the sun was shimmering. Like everyone got dressed. You saw different women walking around. Like there was just, it was just way more New York. I mean, obviously with a warmer climate, but there was some standards. And now I feel like, I'm like, I feel the weight in my life right now. Like I'm taking the back streets through everything I do because there's just no sense of like glamour at all. Like I don't even, I go out and I don't see anybody dressed well. No sense of presentation. No, no. I tried to get there with standards. There's no sense of presentation at all. And it doesn't matter where you go. Like if you're going to any of these places that are sort of like the trendy it places, I mean, we had dinner not too long ago. Like what was anyone wearing? Like no. Oh, I have no idea. Except for the people at our table. Exactly. And it doesn't need to be the fucking row. No. But like we can get a crispy white t-shirt and wear it with a nice blazer. Like let's just like put some stuff on. You know, it's very funny. I was at South Beverly Grill the other night. Nothing better. Did you get the ribs? No, but next time I got, oh, I get the, the yellowtail salad. The best. With fries and a martini. It was perfect. It was so good. Then I went to the movies. I was in bed by 10. Nothing, nothing better. I'm telling you right now though, the ribs off like unity. Okay. Yeah. Okay. But the thing was, I mean, it was early, but everyone was in sweats. Yeah. It's just like, that's a nice, I know that it's a chain sort of, but like it's a nice restaurant. It's a nice restaurant. It has don't wear sweats. Mood lighting. Yeah. You're drinking there. Like I, and I also just like, to me, if you're wearing sweats, you haven't changed from the night before. Like you slept in that and you left leggings with like a chic jacket over it. That's like covering your, covering your bum. Like there's a way to do that. Athletes you're aware. I think Nicole Richie did it really well in 06. That works. I'm not, I'm not happy. And that's also why I'm so grateful again to be able to have this brand that operates out of New York. So I can go and wear some of the clothes I buy. So what has that experience been like to, you lived in New York for a while too, right? I lived in New York. I lived there for a year and a half. It ate me alive or I ate it alive. I gained literally 20 pounds in six weeks. Wow. No, it was a whale. Like I got off the airplane and my parents picked me up. It was like my first, like first semester of college and they were like, are you having an emotional crisis? Oh, it was, it was in college. No, it was in college. It was a long time ago. But that happens to everybody because of the buffet. Yeah, but it was like really big. But yeah, I lived there for a year and a half until I was like, I can't do this anymore. I need to come home. Mama needs to come home. I had to surrender. And forever since I've always been, it's like a toxic relationship. Like I'm always trying to like get the city to take me back. And now I'm in a nice groove where like we see each other over a few months. It's casual, but like kind of serious. Yeah, I feel like I also have a toxic relationship with New York in that I tried to break up with it for, I lived there for 15 years and the last five I tried to break up finally was able to break up because of COVID. But then every time I go, I'm, I don't want to move back in any way, but I am addicted to it. And I'm like, I got to go, I got to go, I got to go, I got to get there, I got to get there. My husband's there this week. I'm like, I should have gone. Why? Why? Why to go some dumb party? No, that I'm not going to, I'm going to go to for five minutes and be like, I hate all of you. I'm leaving. Like it's, but it is part of it is to wear the clothes that is part of now it's really cold there though. So, so we're lucky. But I think people from here, if you're from California or honestly from the West coast, I went to college with a lot of California kids, some LA kids. This is the best quality of life in America. Like there isn't, it's, you can't, the East Coast is so crowded and the quality of life there is so much lower than here. I don't think I can ever move back because of that. Like it just is too, life here is too, too good. But what has it been like for you to, you go to a lot of fashion shows and stuff too. I don't know if you've been doing that forever, but I've seen you at Hermes and other shows in Europe. Yeah. What has it been like to be sort of incorporated into that world? It's such a privilege. Like I know that sounds cheesy, but it's so fantastic. Like, you know, I've met a bunch of different people that work in the brands and obviously they're all just wonderful, cool, like people. I know, I know, you know, a lot of them and it's just, it's honestly an honor to be invited. And I love the toxicity of it where it's like, we're gonna invite you this time, but we're not going to invite you next time. But maybe we'll invite you in the future. And my ass is like with her tail wagging, like ready to go no matter what, flying my ass over there myself. But every time, I mean, these shows, there's so much effort that goes into them, even just like, for my own self, like getting myself there, getting myself dressed, doing all the things, and they're seven minutes long. But there's no rush like it, it's the best. But people should be paying, pay, pay for Morgan to come. People should be paying for your flights. You know that some, I don't think this happens a lot with like, people who aren't A list actors, but sometimes they get PJs. Listen, I like 250 grand flights to get people to these shows, like it's on a regular basis. No, it is literally, and I hate to say this, but I'm going to say it here because this is the time to say it. Like, people have had a really hard time, I think, in these different brands, like placing me because they're like, well, yeah, are you our client or are you our influencer? Like, and I'm just like, guys, I'm the best thing that's ever happened to you. Don't underestimate me. I will sell the literal fuck out of everything out of a price point that you're not even comfortable with. Yeah. And I'm, I can speak to it because I actually wear it and I actually buy it. You know, like it's, it's, it's all of these silly. And then like, I see no shade, no tea, but like some of these other girls that are doing some of these promotional posts. And I'm like, that's who you just, well, it's interesting. You, you see the people who invite you and you can tell those are the brands that are a little smarter. Yeah. I saw you at the Ralph Lauren show a couple, like last year at some point, I thought it was really smart of them to invite you to that. I've seen you at the Hermes show. Not all of these brands have creative people thinking about who to invite to the show. Right. And so they invite the same people every single season. And there are people 10, they've been doing it for 10, 15 years posting these outfits and you're like, this person is never going to sell anything. It also looks bad. I, I, it's a business. It is a business. I know your friends with them. You don't need to invite them. And that's the like, that's when I, I get excited when there's a new designer at a brand or there's a new group of people running it. Cause I know they're going to switch all that stuff up. Honestly, like I have shivers, like chills on the body because it's so well said. And I have said this to so many people because I'm always a little grumpy because I feel like I don't get the credit I deserve. Like I'm selling out all of these different Chanel flats and like, and I don't obviously get a dime from that. But then like every person from every department store is like, they're all gone in your size or in every size. And I, I say this specifically, the Rolodex is dusty. Like we got to shake it out and like invite some new, and it doesn't even need to be me, but it needs to be other people. 100%. Like, come on. Like what I, a Valentino, what they did at the last show with just like straight A-list actors and like true fashion people. I was like, oh my God, like respect, like you, that's fantastic. Yeah. You know, it was interesting at the Elias show in New York. Also, it felt like they tried really hard to get everyone who wanted to be there there. I'm sure there were a million people who were, who wanted to go who were not invited. But when I looked around that room, I thought, okay, they really made an effort. It wasn't, it was all the cool people, but it was also some people who are important, but not cool. And I could, it felt very genuine. And that I was like, damn, AM very, I feel, like you said, honored. Like, look, this is my job. It's a little different. I'm not like, I don't think I, you know, like, they're the only reason they invite me is for me to write about it. And I get that. But I was like, thank God, I got, I got to go to the show. Like sometimes I don't care. Right. That time I was like, wow, I feel really lucky that I got to experience this. And, and yeah, and I just don't think, look, it's, it's a big job. And they are under a lot of pressure. But the problem is like, not everyone who's working in those positions is like a super creative person and not any, everyone running the companies are super creative from a like strategy perspective. Totally. They need more people like you. And they need to think more the way you think about things. And, you know, I think the industry's changing, but, but there's a lot of ways to go, I would say. I think so too. I really, and I appreciate you saying that because I just feel like this is such like a simple fix. Like you do need to think because I also feel like the people that are getting by it, it's almost like that's all set in stone. As we said, the Rolodex is so dusty, but it's like, no, you need to like think about this from all angles. And I think also just even like with Kim Kardashian, kind of what she has been able to accomplish. This woman has made billions of dollars flying around on her own whole ass plane with multiple homes, brands worth billions. I mean, she started on a reality TV show, the fact that people in positions of influence to help cultivate like a strategic plan for their brand or the people they work for, don't think of every single person as like a potential next Kim Kardashian is mind boggling to me. It's so true. Don't underestimate people just because you're not that familiar with them. Like that's silly. So true. Speaking of not underestimating you, what is next for Ringley? What are what, what should we expect in year two? Oh my God, you're too. So we have, we just, we just launched holiday sweaters. We have spring coming up. Spring is a delight. There is, we're just expanding in terms of design range. There's going to be a little, there's, we're going to have some organza coming, which I know everyone's like, that's had a moment, but we did this a year and a half ago. Like that's when we decided. It's just going to get bigger and better. And I don't want to give away what we're doing, but like, we're just expanding in terms of style and design in a major, major way. I think you should also do home, but I will, I will decide that when I come to your house with my child and he runs around and it wrecks it. You realize I have zero child friendly items. My kids have learned to like walk around my great table, but I have a full playroom and he can draw on the fucking walls if he wants. I'm just kidding. He's actually very good because we also have no child friendly items. I think it's the smartest thing to do. Like your kids need to acclimate to your, it's the one thing my father-in-law told me when I was pregnant, your children are joining your life. You're not joining bears. This is the truth. They are. Thank you, Dr. Phil, right? Literally he said, he's like, you're, your children are joining your life. You're not joining bears. And I was like, oh my God, like does he think I'm not going to be a good mom? But it was so brilliant because we brought Ro home. We have a very modern house, danger everywhere. God forbid, but there has not been one accident because the kids know to sort of avoid this stuff. Look, this is a huge reason I only want to have one kid. Yeah, no, there's clearly it can help no matter what. But this idea of like, this is our life and you're here for a while and when you're 18, you get to enjoy your life. This is why I don't play titty bow, titty bow. This music from this Korean cartoon he loves in the car. And I told him, I said, that doesn't play on my phone. That's only daddy's because I'm not playing this. He loves, he has great taste in music. He loves R. E. M. He's really into Heim every morning. I would like Heim. He's very into once you back right now. He loves Heim. He loves all these, these, a lot of bands that like Heim is fine, but he really likes them and we listen to it. I'm not listening to titty bow, titty bow. And it's the same thing. Your kids are not going to screw up your beautiful home. No, it's it's so it the music thing is a I should have probably started with that a little bit stricter but everything else I'm aligned. It's true. We're still by. Yes. Morgan, this was so great. Congratulations on being a great person and interesting and having a successful business. Thank you so much for having me and just come over anytime you want next week. Seriously, I can't wait. I won't bring you on. Don't. Fashion people is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck. This show was produced and edited by Molly Nugent special thanks to our executive producers.
