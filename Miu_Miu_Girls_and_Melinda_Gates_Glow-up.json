Hello and welcome to Fashion People! I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Puck's fashion and beauty memo line sheet. And today with me on the show is New York Times fashion reporter Jessica Testa. We're talking about the Mew Mew Girl, the Melinda Gates Glow Up, the Olympics closing ceremony and we're also asking, what's up with New York Fashion Week? Let's get started. Hey everyone, hope you are having a good week. I am in Los Angeles. I have heard from many of you that you are still on holiday. Of course you are. I am not on holiday. I'm going on vacation next week which is very exciting. But I, to go to Lego Land this weekend and... As a person who would not go to an amusement park as an adult prior to having a child, I'm very interested in how these things are executed. And I will say, so now I've done Disney and Lego Land. I'm going with a three-year-old which is much easier than, you know, going with like two, ten-year-olds who want to do a bunch of stuff. But the branding of these amusement parks, I also went to like a Thomas the Tank Engine sort of haphazard amusement park, which we could talk about offline. But the branding of these things are, there are so many lessons for fashion people in there from the merchandising of the retail, to the rides, to the sort of experiences, to the food. It's truly remarkable. I highly recommend. I know a lot of you are going to be going to Disney and outside of Paris for the Copernay show during Paris Fashion Week. But I don't I don't know if I'm going to go or not. But you should go to Lego Land in Denmark also if you live in Europe, or you should go to you should just go to one of these things with a little kid and just see what it's like, because I feel like for fashion people, these things are actually really interesting to look at what people are wearing, to look at how they've executed. There are a lot of learnings there, as we love to say. Anyway, this week on Line Sheet, I have an update on everyone's favorite founder, Phoebe Philo, some movement in that business. So I figured it was time to do a bit of a state of the union. I'm sure there will be a lot more happening this fall that as as we get into the shows and all that, I hope she does something. She does some sort of activation. I'm using tons of annoying startup language today, but I hope she does some sort of activation or something. In Monday's Line Sheet, I also deviate from the usual coverage and comment on what's happening with the Apple Watch. I don't know about you, but I am pretty much no longer wearing mine. And it's not only because of the awful tan line. I just I just don't feel like I need it like I used to. I used to be really addicted to it. I love tracking stuff, but now I just much rather wear my nice watch. I also wanted to thank you all for the great feedback on the Nike pod with Jacob. We had a really good time recording it, and I'm glad everyone enjoyed it. Let's get going with Jessica. Jessica Testa, welcome back to fashion people. Lauren Sherman, thank you again for having me. How are you? I'm great. I'm doing great. It is August, as you know, it's funny. I got a text from a publicist who works in Paris last week. And he was like, I'm sure maybe you got it too. But he was like, Jess, I'm very sorry for disturbing you in August. I didn't like the whole month of August. I didn't get that one, but that's extremely funny. Yeah. Is wouldn't it be nice? Yeah, the Europeans live live differently than we do. Are you did you take any big vacations this summer? The only question that anyone asked set a fashion show. Where did you go on holiday? It's the first one you ask. I didn't and I will have nothing to say, so I'm going to need to practice. Did you I went because I went to Milan and Paris in June, not really for fashion week for meeting stuff. And I went to Norway prior to that, which was really nice. I'm going up to Portland and the Bay Area for a week and taking like a real that was not really a vacation, which is my fault. Not my employers. They would really love for me to take a vacation, but I'm going to do that. But the thing is living on the West Coast, the whole Europe, go to Europe for two weeks thing just seems dumb. Maybe you could go to Asia for two weeks, go do the Tokyo. But you don't want to go to Tokyo in August, believe me, I guess not. I wouldn't know. I do know. I live in a family that one one member of the family goes to Japan at least once a year, usually twice. So and I've been a few times, you don't want to go in August. But yeah, we'll see. I think we're going to talk about fashion week more later. But are you have you ever gone to any of the other weeks like Copenhagen or Tokyo? I've never been to Tokyo. I've never been to Copenhagen, although after this time, I was like, maybe I should go to that and tack a vacation on. You know which one I've been to Singapore fashion week. How is that? It's the only other place in Asia. I've been to Japan three times in Singapore, which is funny, but it's one of these. It's mostly wealthy people buy tickets to go to the shows. And Peter Piloto, a brand that does not exist anymore, but they did a show there that one of the big retailers kind of hosted them. And that was fun. It was interesting. I liked seeing it from a business perspective, like how can you make a fashion week commercial? And that's what they are in cities like Singapore, Sydney or what have you. And I think Sydney for a long time was sort of the fifth or Tokyo or soul. The fifth city in terms of having cool brands. Now I'd say that's Copenhagen. But I would I would definitely go to Copenhagen. I also think that when you really think about New York and London now, they're sort of like closer to those secondary and tertiary city fashion weeks. The ones that the big, big time shows are in Milan and Paris these days. So a part of me wishes I could go to London Fashion Week again. Maybe I will now that that there's new stuff happening in Burberry. Perhaps I will just leave my house for five weeks instead of two and two with one week split. Why not? You might as well. You might as well turn it into one big thing. I had an editor once who was obsessed with them, who thought it would be really like the right writer would have a really good time sort of chronicling like swim week in Miami, too. So we will get to the Mew Mew girl is I went to I did a big piece for Racked RIP. RIP. Yeah. RIP used to be owned by curbed media. Then it was owned by Vox and Vox ran into the ground. What if the great websites? One of the great websites. All the editors are amazing. Leslie, Brett, Izzy, everybody was awesome. But they Julia Rubin, who still works at Vox and runs features for them. She assigned me to go to cover the prom trade show in Atlanta. It was awesome. And I met the host of Say Yes to the Say Yes to the Dress, which I am not a reality television person. But when I did have cable a long time ago, I would watch Say Yes to the Dress. And I went to that store when I was getting married, I went to that store as a joke just to like try try dresses on. But that was really interesting. And the thing about those trade shows and these sort of secondary fashion weeks is there are buyers who will just go to five of them a year. And that's like their social life. That's their budget. But there were these people were like, yeah, I go to the prom show in New York, Chicago, LA and Atlanta. I think another another interesting story, if it hasn't been done already, two is I think teenagers are approaching prom much more casually than they might have when you when you attended the prom trade show, too. I recently taught this class to 23 teenagers on reporting on style and fashion. And that's was their feedback was that like prom is not like it's sort of seen as like a try hard to get so dressed up for prom these days. Where I was very everyone I knew I didn't, but a lot of people were vintage dresses. That that seems to be the coolest thing you could possibly do. I think I wore a Calvin Klein dress from Dillard's. Mine was from Macy's because we didn't have Dillard's. But I wore like a gunmetal gray Calvin Klein dress with a sweater to match like to look like one of Paltrow's Golden Globes look in 1998. Is that your spirit, Gwyneth? Shout out to Marissa Melton. Yes, it is. I think I found it for her at some point. But then there was another one that I was like, actually, this is really my personality. It's really hard to find images because that was the year of Shakespeare in love and the pink Ralph Lauren was really popular. But yes, I was really into that whole like sweater set and gray dress look. I can imagine it. You still are, I would say. I am. It's true. It was something's never changed. So seeing things never changing, the Mew Mew Girl has been cool since the 90s when I was in high school and you did a great piece this week. Sort of one thing you're really good at is putting a stake in the ground of like, this is the thing and everyone's talking about and this is why. And you did a really great job with this Mew Mew Girl piece in the in the style section on Sunday, right? Right, right. And the tricky thing about this piece is too, is like, I don't necessarily think they're written for fashion people. Name drop the podcast. But I think they're written for like the average New York Times reader who might have heard of Mew Mew, like be aware of these astronomical sales numbers that have come out recently, but like need it explained to them in a sense. So what did you learn as a fashion person about Mew Mew from doing this piece that was designed to appeal to a much broader audience? I mean, I think the numbers are truly shocking, don't you think? Well, I think they're shocking, but also Mew Mew is very small. If you turn on distribution and you turn if you turn everything up and you have a cool brand, doubling sales is not crazy. It's still less than 20 percent of Prada. Yes. So in that way, and I'm also hedging for them because it's something they're going to start going down and then everybody's going to freak out. But in that way, I don't think it's that crazy. What I do think is interesting is that all this time, every brand is struggling and Mew Mew and Prada to an extent, not as not as crazily are still like they're selling stuff, logos all over them. And people are buying them when the logo thing has been on the out for a couple of years. Like, what did you find out? What do you think the key is to the success they've been now make? Well, I will tell you the question that ignited my curiosity the most about the story is from a celebrity ambassador perspective. And I think who a brand chooses as their ambassador says a lot about their business strategy, how they see themselves, et cetera. I was always so curious about how you could reckon having Sidney Sweeney on the docket with somebody like Emma Corrin, like someone with a much edgier look next to somebody who is sort of like the most conventionally beautiful young woman, you know, it takes all of those boxes of like of what what we're told is beautiful. And then you have somebody like Emma Corrin, who is also really, really beautiful, but in this very edgy and interesting, almost academic, nerdy way. That was what I was most curious about. And the answer to that was really like, OK, you can be, you know, the idea is some days you wake up and you want to be a Sidney Sweeney and some days you wake up and you want to be an Emma Corrin. And I would be curious what you think about that, because I don't know if I agree with it, but maybe it's because I'm not a Mew Mew girl, you know. Yeah, I'm not a Mew Mew. I've always been a proud person, not me. I love Mew Mew. I think it's super cute, but it's just never been for me, even go when those shows are like 100 percent perfect. Like this last show was so good and I was still like, yeah, I would wear a couple of those. It's I'm more of a product. I've always been more product. But I think they have always been they were sort of the first other than Armani to do celebrity dressing. And they started probably 10 years after him, but they just took a very different approach. And they are just so early on the ground floor. They are talking to the agents and they're really embedded in Hollywood. And now a lot of other brands have sort of copied their model, but they're talking about who is next before anyone else's before these people are like even signed to the agency, barely. So it has always been when you look back at that first and Prada as well. If you look back at that first Prada, Uma Thurman, Pajmina slash Lavender dress that she wore in probably 96 about, they've just always had a really good sense of who is up and coming and who they should be working with on on campaigns. Or now Prada is seen as it was always sort of seen as more mature. But now it's really seen that way. So you have like a Scarlett Johansson working with Prada. But you also have Maya Hawk and Hunter Schieffer working with Prada. Yes. And think about like two out of three of those actresses were in a West Anderson film or I mean, Scarlett Johansson probably been more than one. But but like Prada is so connected to the film world. And so they really do use like true actresses, not on news or, you know, people who grow into like Hunter Schieffer might be young, but I would say she's not really an ingenue, Maya Hawk, maybe. But anyway, I think like that that part of it. They're both girls. And that is what when you say the Mew Mew girl. And then it's funny that Max Berlinger, he did a he did a piece for styles right on guys wearing Mew Mew. Do they even do they sell men's clothing now? So it's just guys like right. But they do have yeah, but then they'll have somebody like Troy Samon on the runway wearing women's clothes styled in a men's way, which I think was like the point of Max's excellent piece. Yeah, it was really good. But but I think that they are able to pinpoint. And yes, Emma Corrin and Sydney Sweeney are totally different. But they both. Does Emma Corrin go by they them? They them. OK, yeah. I think the idea when I talked, I talked to them for the piece and like ideas like girl is like a word that doesn't have a gender. And I think Mrs. Prada feels that way, too, that like girlishness is beyond age and beyond gender, which is another question of like the age, the age piece, right? You don't we associate girl, the word girl with being very young. And a lot of these ambassadors are very young. But then on this in this most recent show that you loved, that was a bit more elegant and mature. There was that septuagenarian model. And when we think of gender, the words boy and girl and male and female, all of that stuff is sort of being separated from sex. So it does make sense that they're sort of making the word girl their own in a way. Yeah. And I think that all of the contradictions that exist within girlhood and within within gender and within age and how we dress for our age or don't dress for our age, like, I think that they're playing with those concepts and the playfulness is what the customers like. For sure. I'm I'm very happy for as as always for any company doing well, especially when they are making things that feel special, no matter how expensive or cheap they they are. So best of luck to to Prada Group. I want you all to succeed and not be sold to someone else. Mimi is the empire built on six thousand dollar sparkly underpants. Love it. Do you ever wear those little underpants as shorts? Is that your style? I don't know. No, I actually like the really long shorts that are in style right now. Me too. I just bought a pair of like skater shorts from La Mer when I was in Paris that are good and was just talking to a friend because it's so hard to find it shorts are hard. Impossible. It's just not it's not it's not fun.

So speaking of shorts, the Olympics, there were some short. I love the runners, little mini shorts. Those look great. I love those looks. But did you watch the closing ceremonies? I did not get to watch them live, but I caught up after the fact. And I was most tickled, of course, by the transition to Los Angeles that we saw. Yes. I fell asleep twice trying to watch the Tom Cruise part. It was so short. I fell asleep both times. Like, I have an L-shaped couch, which I'm extremely proud of. Sure. It was a long time coming. We had this L-shaped couch. The L is mine. L for Lauren, L for the L, L for Line Sheet. And the L is my always mine. So I own the L-shaped couch. And but the problem is, no matter what time of day it is, I just fall asleep immediately. So I did get to see quite a bit of it, but I was poked away twice to watch the and I fell asleep twice to watch the Tom Cruise part of it. But I did see Karen Bass in her Sergio Hudson, which I thought she looked fab. I love I love that dress. But the opening ceremony, the closing ceremony uniforms. I thought, I mean, they're definitely not as exciting as the opening ceremony. Those are much more formal. The closing ceremony, everybody's exhausted. And so they end up being little track suits quite a bit. But I was still disappointed. There wasn't one I saw where I was like, damn, I would want to buy that. And that's unfortunate. Was there anything that you saw that you really like? Not of the athletes uniforms. And I agree. I think it's everyone's exhausted. It's not just the athletes, but like, we're kind of exhausted with watching the Olympics too. And and I think a lot of athletes have gone home by that point, too, especially if your event was earlier in the in the Olympics and ended early, you know, ended a few days into the the whole thing. So I think that it's just not showing off as not the point. It's just sort of like a last hurrah and really doesn't seem to be the priority of countries to really like boast their their looks. It feels like to me, a little bit of a missed opportunity for the companies that are making these outfits, because I was looking at the Ralph Lauren one, which was it was fine. And I thought it was better than the initial looks, even though I didn't hate those piped jackets. A lot of people did. I whatever. I think everybody's a fashion critic. Everyone's a critic generally. And I just like settled down award shows and Olympics and the Mac Atlas. Yes. Oh my God, it's exhausting. I have fewer opinions than most people on the Internet about this stuff. But I just think like I was looking at a lot of the gear that Ralph Lauren's selling. And it's fine. Again, totally fine. There wasn't anything like, damn, I want to buy this. I did like the Ralph Lauren flag shirt with the Olympic rings, the flags with the Olympic rings. I thought that was cute. But it just feels like you could do a uniform for the athletes for the closing ceremony and then do something that's retail that's pretty similar. And it would just feel more. I don't know. It's like, see now, buy now. It just feels like if you're going to do see now, buy now, this is the best opportunity. Right? Yeah, I think there are a lot of missed opportunities, although I did see some people impressed with the jeans from the opening ceremony to the Ralph jeans. But I can't endorse those jeans. But I agree. I think that there's there's a lot of opportunities here that are missed. And we're getting there, though, I think with even like watching the Olympics felt a lot easier and a lot more accessible and a lot more sort of. It was like really pushed in a way by Peacock. And, you know, there's been a lot written about how this was like the first TikTok Olympics. And I do remember working at Buzzfeed and during the Olympics and they we were getting like takedown notices constantly for videos like the people were just tweeting out or like trying to embed in stories because, you know, NBC had such a chokehold on that footage. And now I think they've really relaxed that and realized that you can't really control it as much on the Internet. And so hopefully I think along with NBC and Peacock sort of embracing that, we'll see more of the brands embrace that because I mean, if nothing else, I think this Olympics showed us how you can turn fashion into like a national point of pride, right? With LVMH and their sort of sponsorship, although that's not quite the right word partnership. Maybe you, maybe you recall. I've been calling it the Macron tax. Do you think that we'll see any of like any of that same energy around fashion brands for Los Angeles? I do. And I think there's a big chance that LVMH will be involved again, maybe not. Or I think the people organizing the LA Olympics would very much like that. And given how much money LVMH pours in every single year to Hollywood and there's so many as we'd love to say in this business synergies, I think that they're definitely not going to be the lead. But let's see what they feel like they got out of this. But there would be an opportunity for them. I definitely think we're going to see a way bigger presence of skims. It's just they'll be an even bigger company at that point. They'll probably be public. And so there's going to be tons of opportunity for them to be involved. And yes, I think like the Hollywood of it all, and there will be such an increased presence of celebrities at the at the games that there is going to just be a lot more opportunity. So we'll see. And I also think this is the first Olympics that in the last 15 years or so. The London was pretty big as well. But that that like the internet Olympics, when people were really online that I felt like NBC and Peacock got the distribution pretty much right with having TikTok, but also just like the way you use the app and all that stuff. Like in the streaming era, this feels like this has been the most successful deployment of the games, whereas for me, I don't think I watched it for many years. And it granted like in a different place in my life where watching the Olympics with a little kid is more fun. But I think I would have still been sort of watching it anyway, given it being in Paris and just where they have it is also a big part of the marketing. And I think like Paris, Milan, Los Angeles, it's not that's not by accident. I'm sure they also, you know, it's always comes down to money. But but yeah, I think that like there's probably tons of opportunities and maybe for brands that got boxed out by the LVMH of it all in France, because there's no way LVMH is going to throw in 160 mil for Los Angeles. Right. Maybe tapestry. Yes. Yes. I think yeah. And to that point, I think what you were saying about the Los Angeles mayor wearing Sergio Hudson, like I did appreciate that too. I thought that she could have been wearing anything that she could have been wearing Ralph Lauren, for example, and for her to wear a smaller American designer was an interesting choice. Not that that was the most high profile of her appearances, but she might not be mayor when this happens, correct? I assume she won't be. I don't know. So this was her her chance, really, because yeah, she might not be around. Yeah, I don't I don't remember how long it is. Sorry, I've only lived here for four years, so whatever. Don't fact check me on this. So speaking of choices, I did a piece last week about rich people dressing nicer than they used to. And the the person of interest was Melinda Gates, who has been making some real fashion choices. She's doing this series. I don't remember what it's called, but it's pegged to her 60th birthday with like luminaries like Oprah and Billie Jean King. It's YouTube and they're posting it on Instagram and wherever on social media. And the first thing I noticed when this pops up on my Instagram is like she's wearing a courage turtleneck branded and an Elias skirting belt. And then in another episode, she's wearing a Skapeurelli shirt dress. Like these are not things that are being loaned to this woman. She is buying all this stuff. And I did end up doing a little reporting and found out it is an internal person. I have not found out the person's last name and when I do, I will reveal it to luncheam readers, but I have not yet. But I was curious what you think of this Melinda shift in dressing strategy. And if you think it says something bigger about how public figures, because right now I mean, we're all thinking about this with the election and everybody's appearance is just being really scrutinized this time. I feel like more than ever. But what have you observed from your corner? I really liked your piece on it. And the first thing I did after reading it was try to figure out who her stylist is, as I'm sure you did. And I think my theory coming out of it was actually that, and especially if you look at the brands that she's wearing, that she's working with like a Bergdorf shopper. That was the theory that I had come to. But does your reporting contradict that? I think you're probably right. And there's someone internal helping. But I agree. Like Travis Kelsey, he works with personal shoppers at all these stores, probably has someone now that works in-house to help him organize it. But that makes a lot of sense. And Bergdorf is the right one or anemons because it's so much, it is Schiaparelli and Alaya. And these are brands that they push. And I would like to see her working with a stylist for just for the storytelling purposes too. Like, I don't know what the story she's trying to tell is with this like sexy red Alaya belt. Right. And I think that working with somebody, the person who came to mind was Bailey Moon, who you've written about before in line. She who works with a lot of like sort of more mature sort of smart women. Um, like that, that would be an interesting match because I think like, I like that she's, um, clearly trying to show some, some kind of personality and some interest in fashion in a way that you're right. Like we don't see from, often see from those types of personalities historically, but she's who, who would very much consider it like a, uh, you know, an uninteresting and sort of frivolous endeavor, right? To be interested in fashion. Um, I like that she's bucking that trends, but I think there could be more storytelling there. I agree. I for a minute thought she might be working with Carla Welch because Carla Welch is rumored. I don't think she's ever gone on the record to say it. And, and I, I don't think even speaks about it privately to work with, uh, with Kamala Harris. And it's, it's confirmed. I just don't know if she's ever gone on the record to speak about it. I'm not sure. But, um, but in the end, I'm sure she isn't working with Carla, but I did think and Carla doesn't really work with like private figures. Like Bailey works with Jill Biden and so, but it does feel like Linda Gates is a philanthropist. She's a public figure. If she's going to work with a stylist, she needs to work with someone. I almost texted Meredith, Michelle Obama's stylist, but Meredith is the most discreet person alive and I would be feel bad asking her. So he was like, I bet she knows who it is, but I can't ask her who it is. And I don't think, I don't think it's her. Um, but it, it's interesting. It will come out at some point. And if it is one of just a Bergdorf person and an assistant, then that is that story of itself, that's sort of how it crom became Michelle Obama's person. Michelle used to shop in that store and in Chicago, a crom store, and that's how they started working together. So there is this history of public figures working with kind of untraditional celebrity stylist, that sort of thing. What I remember from the Obama era, though, was that Meredith was publicly known to be and like much more in the narrative of Michelle's style than Carla and Kamala's style, which is sort of like this, as you mentioned, this unconfirmed slash, you know, ambiguous relationship. And I think that there's a real, I think that that is a real, um, a real shame because I, as stylists, in my mind, I think that that relationship can be seen as similar to, you know, the art broker that you use, right? And although it's even, it's almost more important because it is the person who is sort of helping you set your public image. And as we know, public image is like the most important thing to a lot of these people who are in this category that we're talking about, politicians, entrepreneurs, philanthropists. And it just, I think that there should be more of a public embracing of these people. I agree. I think one of the reasons is Meredith, again, she worked for Ekram and, and then Michelle and her started working together and it, it sort of came into that. I think a big reason is because a Kamala is, is the candidate. So there is more scrutiny around public image. And if you're using someone who is using something like a stylist could feel frivolous, quote unquote, whereas with the wife of a politician, it's, it's a little bit, you're supposed to be dressed up and look a certain way. Politicians supposed to look another certain way. And that is supposed to be more effortless is, is what I, I assume one of the reasons. And maybe Kamala Harris is just really private and doesn't want people to know where she gets her iri, newer theorems. Like I don't, I don't know, but it's, it is interesting. And I am sure that Carla is going to get a lot more scrutiny as the next six months. And I mean, Kamala has just looked incredible in the last few weeks. It's just, it is, it's remarkable. She always looks really good, but I've, I've just been so impressed by the way she's been dressed and their choices and all of that. So it's going to be a fun thing to watch. And what do you think, and then we should move on to New York Fashion Week because we could talk forever. I think we're not going to get to talk about whether or not the Apple Watch is dead, but what do you think about like this idea that people are paying more attention generally to, to the way they look? Do you think it has to do with like succession and stealth wealth and all of that? Cause if you look at the Sun Valley runway show from this year versus even five years ago, it's very different. Like every single person was in branded Patagonia vests five years ago. Now there's like a lot of diversity in the way people dress. Barry Diller showed up in a printed blouse. Like there, there are a lot more, there's a lot more flair to what Stacey Bende obviously just goes for it there, but she always has. But now every, it feels like moat, the majority of people are really thinking about what they're, what they look like when they walk up to that lodge. Do you think like, what do you think is sparking that shift in culture? I think there's a direct correlation between that and the, just how visible we all are. Right? There's no, in the lack of like privacy and the idea that you can be a private figure and especially when you're in one of these high powered positions, like people know, I think people also know the names of more billionaires today than they did five years ago. I think that that it's just, that it's a reflection of like our visibility as people and that goes for private figures as well as public figures. Like you're constantly being in that you're in the back of somebody's TikTok at any time that you, anytime you leave your home, if you live in a major city. It's true. My advice would be to just wear a Navy Dior suit. Like all our no friends. Yes. Be consistent. Yeah. There's not, there's no, I don't think that, you know, you mentioned that people are showing more flair and that is really interesting. And I don't know what I would pin that to, whether it's this like peacocking desire, but it's, I don't think you have to try so hard. I mean, Kamala looks great because she looks composed and she looks consistent. And she, you know, she's not trying to show off, would you agree? Yeah. 100%. But she hasn't sacrificed looking good for being modest or being wanting to look like not show offy. She's also been on the trail a lot shorter time than most candidates are. True. And she just has good personal style. I mean, I think that's something that people forget and you really see that in sl- when celebrities look good, a lot of times, yes, they have perfect bodies or, or, you know, so-called perfect bodies or they have a great stylist or a good tailor. But most of the time it's because they also know what they're comfortable in personally. And that she, she has that. And it is, you know, because she's a woman, it's more clear. Obama had a, you could go down the list of, of politicians. It's easier to see. Obviously, Angela Merkel is a great example of this as well. But there's so many of them just don't think, they just know they want to look like okay. They don't really think about, you could know she thinks about what she wears. And, and that is, it's refreshing and, and really fun, fun to see. I mean, Hillary Clinton never looked that comfortable in her clothing, even though she wore beautiful suits. She just never looked that comfortable because it probably wasn't her style. And she felt like she needed to dress a certain way. I loved the photos of her. There would always be photos of her weddings where she'd be wearing these very glamourous moomoo's. Oh, amazing. Are you feeling overwhelmed with all the supplements out there? Totally get it.

Final thing, we don't really have a rumor of the week this week because there's just not, there's just not a lot going on guys. Like we're, we're, we're in waiting. We're going to ramp up there. There will be an avalanche in September, but you mentioned that we should talk about fashion week and I haven't covered New York fashion week and I haven't really covered this in line sheet for one day I forgot. Then another day I was like, that's probably too late. I'll just wait until, until the show's yet going. But this New York fashion week is quite strange. There are a lot of people, Helmetlang's not showing, Joseph Altsazar is not showing, Mark Jacobs as usual is not showing, but then Proenza Scholar is showing on the fourth. A lot of Ralph Lauren's showing on the fifth. This is not during official fashion week. And then there really isn't anything at the end of the week that's that big. Michael Kors is showing earlier than he normally shows. Alaya is obviously showing in New York and that's what we're all really excited about. But generally it feels like what, what was, my takeaway was like, wow, this feels so empty and I'm, I'm going because half of my life is still in New York and I need to be there and see people and all of that. But if it wasn't, I probably would skip it. What did you think? I felt similarly, I felt like the most intriguing things were the people who are not, who don't show in New York coming, you know, like Alaya, as you mentioned, off white is from what I hear going to have a very big show big in terms of attendance numbers, like a large sort of party. Okay. Big show. I can see Lauren's face is sort of scrunched into a blimbing end at the moment. Isn't it like at 11am or something? I, you know, I'm, I'm terrible with this, the schedule. I feel like I never look at it until the actual week before, but I already put it in my schedule. We're going to look, but, but you heard it's a big party. I don't want to put party is my, my description of it. Okay. Just because of that is the, the vibe of the brand. It's very like on the posts and the show is going to be very large. I heard. And then totem is also showing in New York. Oh yeah. Using the opportunity, I think to promote it's a new store that's coming to Madison Avenue, which is also, you know, so these, these sort of anachronistic people, I think are the things that sort of prick my ears up, but, and I hope that maybe, you know, when there's not 10 polls, it clears the way for new 10 polls, right? Sure. I, it's so, it's, I'm so, I've been through this so many times. In some ways, it's better when it's less crowded. I do really, really wish Mark Jacobs would show during New York Fashion Week. He used to close it. It was a great way to close the week for a while. He showed up for many years. He showed on Mondays and then he started closing and it just felt like have one big show at the beginning and one big show at the end and whatever happens in between, fine, but it makes it worthwhile being there and spending a lot of time. Like I keep getting more and more invites and I don't RSVP to that many shows because in the end, I end up overbooking and then I have to not show up to stuff and email them an hour before and say, I'm not coming. And that's not nice to do to the, the companies or to the publicist or whatever. But it is, it's just interesting like in this day and age, quote unquote, we've been through so many different phases of should New York Fashion Week exist? Should it not exist? Has the pandemic killed New York Fashion Week? New York Fashion Week is back. And it is, I mean, it's a huge business in this country. It's a huge part of commerce in the city of New York, like fashion. And so we should have some sort of trade show where we can see what's new and next. But on the other hand, the business itself has become so concentrated in Europe and consolidated in Europe that it does make you question like, what is this all for? I think coach is great. I think they've done a great job. I think Todd, the CEO is fabulous. I think that Stuart has done a really good job there. And from everyone I've ever talked to, he's an incredible leader. And that's a huge reason he still has that job because he makes people feel good and he performs well and they've had great success. I am not sure that they need to do a show during in like a crowded middle of fashion week. I don't know if that does much for them the way a Chanel show does what a Chanel show does for Chanel. I somewhat disagree only because I do think coach has been finding a new relevance with younger shoppers. And that is not just, you know, that was something I was like initially a bit skeptical of. But this summer, especially throughout New York City, like I'm missing a lot more coach backs on the streets. And you know, all of this is anecdotal. But like I do think there's opportunity, you know, if there's no one, if there's this vacuum within New York Fashion Week, like that presents a huge opportunity for coach to really own it. Like I get it. And I get why, you know, we're seeing Peter Doe and the Roe, you know, two American brands show in Paris. Like you said, it makes more sense from a sales perspective. But I do think like there's some, I have this like wish that a powerful force in New York fashion, powerful, unnamed force in New York fashion would sort of call these brands back and make this worth attending and make it make it not so that the most exciting things are visiting brands. I agree. I just got, as we speak, I got an email from Nanushka, which is also showing I will not be going. I'm sorry, guys. Someone maybe, maybe someone else from the PUT team will go to it because I really like the couple who runs that brand. I'm seeing Nanushka too. Oh, and another one, Susan Alexander and Rachel Anstnov. Yes. I RSVPed that yes to that while we were speaking. I will go to that. I think you're right that this, it makes it an opportunity. But I just don't think coach is a runway show brand. Like they've done really cool runway shows with amazing sets, but the clothes themselves, do they, do they need a runway show? I don't, I still don't know if that's the answer. And so they have done so many cool things with media that maybe the, but I don't want to, I, you know, I have not, I don't really have a thesis on that. All I know is that there needs to be enough during the week to make it feel like there's a story behind it. You go to Milan and it tells a story. You get there on Wednesday, you leave or now Tuesday, you leave on Sunday morning and you have, you can tell a story. Paris is much longer. I think the thing with the American brands, I generally agree that they should stay. The interesting thing about the row is of all the brands and I'm going back to when Zach Closen tried showing in Paris. This is like 2010 or something. The row is the only brand that's been able to hold up. And that is because, A, they do a really small show, B, they do it earlier in the week and C, people care the like international fashion industry cares about them as much as they do these other brands. And if you're, if you are not on that level, which most American, independent American brands aren't for, for whatever reason, then you can't, but they, they, they can hold their own there. And so I understand why they do it. Everyone else. And, and I think, and that goes for like bigger brands like Tommy Hilfiger, which they could certainly hold their own in any city too, because they have a tremendous, you know, production budget and attention. But I think it's good that they start, they've been showing in New York. Like I think that when Calvin gets up and running again, they better show in New York, because then it's, it's not worth it. I think that's a big reason Burberry has stuck in London, even though it would be fabulous for Burberry to come and show here for a season or something. They've really stuck to showing in London because they are the biggest brand there. And so I, I generally agree. I just think the row is a bit of a, well, they, they showed they could do it. So I understand why, why they're, they keep doing it. It's unfortunate for New York though, because it does like bring it down a notch. Whereas before that Monday morning, 9am show in there, where they don't even work out of those offices anymore. But that was like a really special experience. Yeah. And I, like, I agree with you. I think they're clearly making it work in Paris and fit very nicely into that, that week. But it would just be nice to be, you know, in the spirit of the Olympics. Yeah. Let's show some national pride. Yes, we love, we love New York. Jess, this was so fun. Thank you as always for joining me. I have to run and do another interview, but we'll talk soon. I'm sure. And I'll see you in a couple of weeks. See you soon. Bye Lauren. I can't wait. Right Each spring, 23 Pulitzer Prizes are awarded for distinguished journalism, books, drama, and music. It was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out. It was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th. Follow and listen on Apple podcasts, the Odyssey app, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcast.",
