Hello and welcome to Fashion People. I'm Lauren Sherman, writer of Puck's fashion and beauty memo line sheet. And today with me on the show, I have Bloomberg Business Week editor-in-chief Brad Stone and reporter Angelina Rascuette to discuss their recent profile of LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnaud. We cover everything from Arnaud's management style and M&A strategy to the million dollar question of succession. Let's get started. Hey everyone, it's Lauren. Before we get going, I wanted to remind you that if you like this podcast, you'll definitely love Puck, where I send an email three times a week called line sheet.

Happy Friday, everybody. I am in Milan. I leave for Los Angeles tomorrow. I've been in back-to-back meetings with Liz Goff, Puck's co-founder and chief operating officer. We are going around from house to house explaining Puck to fashion brands. I think everyone now understands that line sheet is not my sub-stack. It's just one part of a much larger, ambitious organization. I'd say in that way, our mission is accomplished. The work is never done, as we all know. In between meetings, I did manage to write Thursday's email, and luckily there was a lot of fodder. The big news was that Peter Copping, the former designer of Nina Ricci, Oscar de la Renta, and most recently, he was, I guess, I mean, this is not his title, but like the deputy at Balenciaga Couture, that he is the new designer of Lomba. That's the best I'm going to do with the pronunciation. Congrats to all of you that I had to say that aloud. I go pretty deep on this in the email, why they hired Peter, what Peter's strengths are, what his weaknesses are. I also do a little commentary on the general state of talent, acquisition, and fashion. I'd say the one interesting note is that Peter is very experienced. So Siddhartha Shukla, the CEO of Lomba, which is owned by the Chinese group of the same name, it's connected to Fosun, et cetera, et cetera. They could have, Siddhartha could have very well hired a young unknown who was like a disruptor and cool and interesting. But I think that what this indicates is there's something to be said about experience. And I've had this conversation quite a bit with people here in Milan and also in Paris last week. If you're a 40-year-old designer now, there are a few of them that have the ability, in the same way there are 26-year-old CEOs, and they do well to manage these giant teams and these giant operations. But I wonder if Siddhartha hiring Peter pretends a movement in the industry back to hiring designers who are in their 50s and 60s who can really run an operation. Like, 40 years old is pretty young now, especially at these giant groups. If you come up through one of these mega brands, your job is not that big until you get to the tippy top. Obviously, you do experience what it's like to work in a corporate environment, and that's helpful. But you basically have to be as experienced as a CEO to make one of these productions work. So most CEOs are in fashion at least in their late 40s, that type of thing. And I think, I do think we may see that kind of moving back towards that. For the last couple years, a lot of the big groups have hired very young designers to give a fresh perspective at the top. But I think maybe they're realizing, okay, we also need someone who just knows how to do all this stuff. Anyway, it's really interesting. I'm looking forward to following it. And it's one of the many, many appointments ticked off. So at least we have a little closure. And I hope you enjoy this talk with Angelina and Brad from Bloomberg. It was really great to have both of their perspectives. Brad, who is Bloomberg Business Week Editor-in-Chief, who was appointed in January 24. He's coming into this as a reporter and editor, best known for a book on Jeff Bezos. And sort of, I think of him as like a tech industry person. So the fact that he chose Arnaud as the cover, it's obvious, but also not obvious. And so we talked about that a bit. And then obviously Angelina is embedded in Paris, and she's breaking news all the time on M&A. I cite her reporting constantly and did did so a bunch this week. And she's following it very closely. She's also French. So I do think like covering this industry, if you're not French or you don't live in Paris, it is, I don't want to say it's a handicap in some ways. You have a different perspective. But I think she really understands the sort of context of how these brands operate through the lens of being French and being part of French culture. So we talk about that quite a bit too. I hope you enjoy it. I hope you have a great weekend and let's get going. So thank you all for taking the time and doing this on such short notice. Before we get started, the first thing I ask people on the Friday episode is what did you have for breakfast? A banana. That's a first. What about you, Angelina? I had bread and a jam. Wow. Lots of sugar, usually because the podcast is called Fashion People. I don't get a lot of carbs and I also don't get a lot of sugar, especially, I mean, and a lot of people just don't eat breakfast. So I appreciate your answers. So thanks for taking the time. And I guess to start, I read the piece and I'm going to have a little bit on it in the Wednesday in tonight's send. Brad, I'm curious from your perspective, why other than the fact that Bernard Arnaud knows one of the richest men in the world and depending on the day, the richest man in the world, did he feel like the right person for you to have on the cover of your first relaunch of Business Week? Yeah. Thanks, Lord. And thanks for having us on. I almost instantly knew that I wanted to put Mr. Arnaud on the cover when I was appointed editor of Business Week earlier this year. And I think there were a couple reasons. One, not only is he up there as a prominent feature of the wealthiest people in the world, but the stark contrast between how he has built his business and how all of the other technology titans on that list have preceded. And it's almost the exact opposite, kind of anachronistic, not inventing the future, but taking these brands and lifestyles of Europe's past and bringing them all around the world. And I also felt like there was a pretty interesting delta between his prominence and power and people's understanding of it, particularly in the United States. I mean, Lauren, certainly not true for people who listen to this podcast or people who follow your work. But as you know, if you were to take a general sampling of mostly informed people, they think Bernard Arnaud is married to Selma Hayek. And it just, you know, which is hilarious, obviously. So he's sort of not well known. He's very powerful. He's done everything differently. And he's an incredibly fascinating figure. In addition to the fact that the Olympics are in Paris this summer, and in many ways it's his moment, I just, you know, I went on a vision quest to get his cooperation for Angelina and I to go talk to him. I thought it was really smart. And I have noticed, I mean, as someone who follows these people closely and just like wealthy, as you call them, Titans and builders of industries, I, I've been covering this for, you know, 15, almost 20 years. And in the last, you know, three or four, his wealth has obviously escalated. But also the attention with the acquisition of Tiffany, I think has given him more exposure. And also fashion and the consumption of fashion has become a bigger part of popular culture in the US. I don't know if either of you want to answer this Angelina, maybe seeing it from, from being in France versus you and writing for an audience that I assume is like quite, quite maybe not totally US focused, but you have a lot of US readers. What has changed about the culture that has made him other than the fact that he has become extremely rich made him more, more prevalent in, in our everyday conversation about like who's driving business. No, for sure. I mean, I think, especially I would, I would market since COVID, right after COVID, I mean, 2021 was a bad year for all the luxury groups. And then from 2021 onwards, there was a huge boom because people initially they couldn't travel. So, you know, there was revenge spent on, on goods and maybe initially, you know, they listened the restrictions of people would go out in restaurants before they could start traveling. So all that saved up cash was really directed towards those goods. And also the markets, I mean, the markets really boom, you know, there was, you know, that was before we, you know, the on the macro picture, you know, interest rates started coming, coming up. And generally, I mean, the CFO of LVMH had said, you know, we, you know, you have to look at our people, people spend when they feel good about themselves and when they feel good about the markets, it's not necessarily, you know, linked to GDP, but when the markets are booming, people, you know, a lot of our customers, they spend on, on us. So I think, yeah, in parallel, there was that. And if you look at the broader picture of the past 30 years, there's been a boom also in, you know, wealthy people around the world, you know, you had about 400 people, 400 billionaires 30 years ago, now you have more than 2,500. So that's a lot of people who want to buy those bags. Brad, you are an expert on Jeff Bezos. Do you see what are the parallels between the two of them? I didn't expect to find all that many, but I think I was surprised. And, and, and it's perhaps many of these sort of founder, entrepreneur types, you know, they have to share a number of qualities. So an incredible drive, you know, Mr. Arnaud shared with us, you know, he's 12 hours a day, six days a week, a complete knowledge of all of the details of his many businesses. You could call it micromanaging, you know, we spend time with Peter Marino, the architect, and they talked about how they work together and how Arnaud just has opinions on everything. The way in which colleagues and partners, collaborators, employees treat both, you know, Bezos particularly in his sort of pre-quasi retirement days, and then Arnaud today with equal measures of respect and awe and probably a little bit of fear. I mean, we've got a great, a couple of great quotes in the story about the temperature dropping about nine degrees when he walks into a room and the things that you can say in a meeting with Arnaud that will get you killed. So reminiscent to me of Amazon and the mystique that was around Bezos, you know, because when you're, I mean Arnaud's arguably not a founder because he accumulated a lot of these assets, but in many ways he is because current modern LVMH is a complete concoction of his imagination and drive. And when you've built something like that and you've been proven right over so many decades, yeah, there's a halo over your head and a mystique and employees will kind of put up with the relentless drive and all the things that come with it for a chance to kind of work with one of these legendary figures. So, you know, Jeff Bezos built his world in technology, but you know, in many ways I think they're cut from the same cloth. Yeah, it was funny the remark that he doesn't like it when an executive comes in and starts bragging about great numbers immediately. Do you think that that is like the French constitution? Angelina, maybe you have an opinion about this where, you know, when I sit down to a meeting in France, there's a lot of talking about what the bad stuff that's going on. And then you get into the more easy conversation. Do you think that that's a quality of a leader and a particular kind of business leader? Or do you think that that's more a French quality where you don't want to sugarcoat things especially head on? I would say yes and no because obviously we know that, you know, from our reporting, we found out that he hates complacency. He really, he really truly doesn't like it. I think he's a paranoid because he always wants to go forward. And he did go to that very elite engineering school, Polytechnique, which, you know, it's very difficult to get a diploma, degree from there. It's the most prestigious school you could go to in France. However, if you compare him to, for instance, other leaders, if you compare it to François-Enripineau, so granted, François-Enripineau is the second generation, but people, you know, and we've, you know, you've probably met François-Enripineau. He's an affable CEO. He's probably warmer. And if you look as well at Tony Belloni, who used to be his number two of, but I guess Tony Belloni is the wrong example because he's Italian. But Sydney is very, Sydney Talladano is very warm. Exactly, you know, so and Sydney Talladano also went to a very good engineering school, I guess it, but Bernardo is the founder and he is super demanding and he's still doing his store visits every Saturday. So he's, he's really not ready to let go. Well, it was very clear in the piece that he is not, he is not leaving anytime soon and has no, no plans to, and it was funny. I heard that Antoine is a big fan of the show Succession, which I thought was, was hilarious that he has brought that up to people, but it's very clear regardless of how long he's going to stay, that there is a lot of reorganization happening in that business right now, not only is Tony Belloni gone, Sydney was moved into a different position. And then Michael Burke, who was, had replaced him as the head of the LVMH fashion group, has left recently and moved out of that position and Sydney is back and Delphine has taken more responsibility within the greater group Delphine, the oldest daughter, the oldest child and the only daughter. And, and so there is a lot of restructuring. A lot of they, they just announced the CFO is, is going to eventually move out of that position. And it, it seems like, and what I've heard from people, and I'm sure you both have too, is that they are making room for the kids. Obviously, Frederick is now doing work in the family office as well. There's just a lot of movement in terms of next generation and they're bringing in new executives, many with CPG backgrounds, many with not even beauty, not traditional fashion in any way. And it feels like the next phase of the business. So how much of a sense of you spent time with Peter Marino, I saw you quoted Sydney, I'm sure you talked to a lot of the different executives within the group and Angelina, I'm sure you talked to them all the time. What sense did you get that there was a sort of management change and, and reconfiguration for the next phase of the business, which is going to be very different from the last 15 years? And I think for sure he's, so he's still at the helm, he's 75, he can stay until at least the age of 80. And people have said, if he feels he's ready, you know, at the age of 80 to stay on for another five years, he'll probably do, he'll probably do that. And what's true is that at LVMH, you have a lot of talent, whether it's the non family members, but also the children, all the five children, you know, they have, they're really driven. And, but I think he wants to give them time to show their worth. And so that's why there's always this constant sort of reshuffling and the older guard as well, when it comes to the executive committee, they're all, you know, some of the, you know, Tony Beroni stepping down, the CFO at some point also living in the next few years. I think he wants to give his child a chance to grow and show their worth and, and, and then assess. But I think it's probably too soon to say, it's going to be this person or that person. And, you know, in the case of Hermès, if you look at Hermès, there was a transition between Jean-Louis Dumas and Axel Dumas, his nephew. And in between, you had a professional executives, Patrick Thomas, who actually was defending Hermès when Bernard Arnaud attacked. So I, I wonder if we couldn't imagine something like that at some point. I think that's what they were trying to do with Michael Burke. And that's not going to happen now. So, so that's the issue. Michael was that person. And Michael is not going to be there anymore like that. He'll never leave the group totally, but he's, he's not going to be that person. So I agree. That is what I thought was they were setting it up for. But in case the kids weren't ready when BA was ready, that, that it would be Michael, but I don't think that's going to be the case. So it's an interesting, they, they very rarely show weakness because they're so diversified. They can cover up Sephora can make up for weakness at Dior or, or, you know, Tiffany not growing as quickly as, as they maybe had wanted. I thought he handled that with you all the, the, the situation at Tiffany. Well, but it's, it's a fascinating question. And I think in terms of succession and Brad, I know you also talked about succession just generally in your editor's letter, how often I think it was in the FT or some British paper, probably six months ago, it might have been the FT, it might have been something else. I have no, the times or something. But there was an opinion columnist that pointed out LVMH and said, Generational Succession doesn't work. And you could argue that for caring, I mean, it worked to a point, but it has it worked. Will it work long term? I think caring is now repositioning for a new generation of non-family executives to come in and manage the business. But Brad, do you think that this, this generation, the second generation can ever, especially this is such a huge company, essentially what the column was saying was that they were being irresponsible pinning it on, on the kids or prepping the kids. I think the R knows are very unique family. So, but I'm just curious, do you think it ever works? Like Hermes is obviously a one in a 10 billion business. Right. Well, you'll be getting sort of my outsider's view of this because, you know, four or five months ago, I knew almost nothing about this business and, but have been, been studying it and, and, you know, learning a lot. And I will say you're right. I mean, family businesses, as I wrote about in my editor's letter, including my own family's business, they get very complicated very fast and families can fall out and your hand in kids are kind of poison chalice by asking them to take on this responsibility, particularly when, you know, they don't have the drive as the, the founding member. They've, you know, in this case, the kids have been raised with extraordinary affluence. And yet I have to say, you know, not to sound too mushy about it, but R know has, has not just achieved remarkably in business, but as a parent, then I say this as a parent myself, like the idea that, you know, these kids had enormous privilege and they're all and they're not kids anymore. But you know what I mean, like incredibly accomplished and, you know, you go to YouTube and see, you know, is it Frederick playing symphonies on the piano with his parents and same with Alexander, who's now co-running Tiffany and, and, and, and Delphine and what she's achieved at Dior. I mean, Angelina said before they're incredibly driven. They seem pretty disciplined. You know, Alexander's posting his marathon times on Instagram. I'm like, what, what about, what have I done wrong here as a parent? Not that, you know, I'm not proud of my kids, but I don't think they're finishing the marathon, you know, in a couple hours. And, and so it's a unique situation. And he's also taken the, I think the compounded knowledge of succession problems at other companies and been very thoughtful about the way he has structured the holding companies and the way that the five kids and their descendants are sharing authority and are constitutionally required to agree on major decisions and can't withdraw from the business. So I don't know if it'll work, but, and obviously that's the challenge of family businesses, but he's delivered more thought and rigor to it than I have seen anywhere in business.

Angelina, one thing that I'm fascinated by LVMH is the fact that Bernard Arnault took, he was in America in the 80s and he saw private equity for what it really is, and he decided, I'm going to take these sort of ideas of private equity, but I'm not, I'm going to hold on to the businesses and nurture them and build them. And so it's like a very mix of American opportunistic battleground and then this French way of like leading with creativity and emotion, and that somehow ends up making you a lot of money. Do you think he operates differently than other French executives that you cover? And do you see more of a sort of American spirit or side to him in the way he operates? Yes, for sure. I mean, for instance, just the fact that he went to Polytechnique and generally after Polytechnique, the most brilliant minds, they go and work at least in the 70s, you know, when he graduated, I think he got it from 65 or whatever his degree. They go and work, they used to go to work at the Treasury, at Bercy, you know, the finance ministry. And he decided, actually, no, I'm going to go back to the family business, which was at the time was a provincial family business, construction business. And so I think he's made out of different cloth, as you say, he had it in his genes. And for sure, in 81, when the socialist government, you know, France elected a socialist government, the business community really freaked out, and he was probably one of them. And so that's why he decided to go to the U.S., try an American adventure, develop, you know, real estate over there. And at some point, he saw in 84 that there was a more probably business friendly prime minister in charge. And then there was this asset, a textile company that was going bankrupt. And he knew that there was a gem, Christian Dior. And so he bought it. So I think, yes, he's probably very different in that sense that he didn't follow the expected track of somebody who had graduated from that really prestigious school. The business is so different from the business that I started covering. The the shot, the sheer scale and size and the size of the acquisitions. Angelina, you also had a story, which I guess was a tiny bit in in the bigger piece, but then, you know, a larger piece today about the family having an interest in Richmont, which is the owner of Cartier, which I'm sure he would love to own Cartier and Van Cleef and Arpel, maybe not Don Hill, but we'll see what happens. But I, and I don't know if you also wrote that piece about them potentially wanting to sell Mark Jacobs, but I had heard, I heard when I was in in Paris about other smaller brands within the group that they're considering selling. And it's, it's, as the years have gone on, the bigger the acquisitions have become and the more minimized the small businesses have become within the fashion group in particular, I think that they're making small investments in things like restaurants or I saw they just bought a clock company. I think that that makes sense. It's like tinier things that they could nourish, but when it comes to the fashion group, it feels like Kenzo definitely Mark Jacobs to an extent. I mean, that's a little bit bigger, but these smaller brands, John Galliano doesn't exist. Maybe it will in a couple of months, but they own a lot of these Christian Lacroix, the only brand that he ever actually the only two he ever tried to build from scratch Fenty with Rihanna and Christian Lacroix failed. So it, it for them, it feels like bigger is better. Do you see them streamlining the fashion group in the way that care in, in kind of similar to the way that caring streamlined its whole business to focus on these larger companies, because they could buy Ralph Lauren, they could buy Cartier, they could buy Prada, obviously the founders of these companies have to agree to, to this stuff. But do you think that they're moving in a direction where those smaller businesses aren't going to make sense in the portfolio anymore? I think it's hard to say. I mean, we reported on Mark Jacobs because, you know, we heard from very good sources that there was a process going on to sell it. However, we also know that Bernard Arnaud, he hates selling. He's very attached to the idea of owning the brands. And he's, you could say that he's accumulated, he's a hoarder. He's accumulated all these brands that, you know, he, I think he doesn't want to give up until he's really tried everything. And you got to give him that basically. And yeah, and then we'll, I mean, it's true that if you look at profitability, Louis Vuitton is half of the profit of LVMH. So one brand generates half of the profit of this huge conglomerate. So there's a huge skew to focus on Louis Vuitton and then Dior and then Sephora. But there's also a sentimental attachment. And if you think about the restaurant that they bought two days ago, I mean, Chez la Milouie in Paris, it's a fashionista's encounter. You know, I don't think they, you know, there's, you know, they say it's going to be part of the hospitality division, but is it going to make, you know, a huge impact worldwide? Can I add one thing? I think, you know, he, look, he built, he took small things and made them quite large. And I see in the acquisition of Suiza, the clockmaker, and the fact that both Jean and Frederic are on, in the watch businesses at Louis Vuitton and across LVMH, that he's trying to buy little things and allow his kids to build on them. So I think that's, these are partially, yeah, financial and opportunistic acquisitions and partly to be able to give his kids the raw material to go build on top of. I thought one thing that you all pointed out that was really important is this idea of like where luxury belongs in the culture at this moment. There was this crazy peak during COVID that was not natural and pre COVID, it felt like we were running on a treadmill and something was going to break. It was something was going to snap. People were just spending, spending, spending, and then COVID happened. Everyone stopped spending for like six months, and then it went totally nuts again. And these companies expanded and they made all this money. And there's something happening right now in the culture. And I know you all just hired Amanda Maul, who's a friend of mine and I'm the hugest fan of hers. And I'm curious to know what she thinks about this. And I don't know, Brad, if you have talked to her about it at all. But I am getting a sense. I talked to a lot of people who work on the real estate side of luxury, which Angelina, I'm sure you do too, because this is really about real estate. And we all know that. But they really see what the consumer behavior and the consumer patterns are in the stores. And pre COVID, it was like so much about everybody's moving to experiential. It's all about experiences. Someday they're going to stop shopping. And then during COVID, it was like the high net worth people started shopping luxury, like a commodity, like it was going to Zara or something. And now something else has happened in the culture where fashion has been pop culture for the last 15 years, people standing in line waiting for, for to get their off white sneakers or whatever. It feels like the consumer is not satisfied. They don't have as even if they're rich, they don't maybe don't have as much money as they did two years ago. They're not as satisfied with what's available. It doesn't feel as creative. It feels too straightforward. And they're maybe spending their money on experiences, but on a lot of other things too, including friend of mine who works in design said to me recently, all they want are vintage cars and watches. Yes. And, and, um, furniture, but the only cool brand at LVMH right now is low eva. No cool person wants anything other than that. And I'm curious, Brad, from your perspective, because you, you are sort of from the outside looking in, do you see a shift in consumer culture? Do you think that they need to course correct it all in order to make for the next 10 years? Or do you think that it's, it's, um, this is just another blip and they have a lot more room to grow. I think that they have merged consumer culture with celebrity culture and that we live in a celebrity obsessed and influencer obsessed world right now. And, you know, many years ago, they discovered the power of celebrity designers or creative directors and have, and have merged that. So we got, we have Pharrell Williams at, at Louis Vuitton and, and then, you know, Beyonce and Jay-Z at Tiffany and you've got Jennifer Lopez going to the Dior show last week and, and, and, and, and, you know, almost every, you can't even think of a A-list celebrity now who isn't involved or in some way in LVMH's orbit or perhaps one of its competitors, but, you know, who are, who are all too eager and willing to bathe themselves in the aura of, of the LVMH brand and then contribute their presence. And look, I mean, I think this is the world we live in and this is how young people shop and they want to, you know, they want to, you know, buy what their idols wear and, you know, if it's a $5,000 Pharrell, camouflage Louis Vuitton jacket that they, they line up and I look, that's, you know, they can, LVMH can be quite versatile in terms of identifying, you know, new influencers and, and not just this is a very kind of Western interpretation, but they do it in Korea and Japan and China. And, I think they've got a lot of advantages and I think it's a smart, smart strategy. Yeah, I definitely think that they're too big to fail, but I also think that they took the success of Virgil Abloh and tried to apply that to other brands and it didn't work as well because they took like the idea of find someone who understands youth culture who is, he's also, he was a good designer and I think Pharrell is a smart idea and I think it is doing well for them, but there have been a lot of other cases with people actually in the sort of Kanye Virgil, Virgil orbit like Nigo who is a very accomplished designer and also Matthew Williams who was at, at Givenchy and I think that I, Angelina, I don't know if you have an opinion about this, but I think that they're recruitment of talent and caring has also had this issue in the last, I don't know, five years or maybe, yeah, basically since 2018 when, when Perrie of Roussel left has changed quite a bit and it is not as, their matches between the houses and the, and the designers haven't been as sharp in many cases and they, it's been made up for by these amazing successes with Virgil or, or Pharrell, but Angelina, I don't know if you have any opinion or you've observed anything about the way that they recruit design talent and, and whether or not they need to kind of tweak their approach in that way. They're very good at talent spotting and you know this LVMH of fashion prize that they initiated some 10 years ago that's been a really very good success and it's a feeder for, for the whole industry, not just LVMH and I think you have to give them kudos for that because, you know, it's a really like young designers that are emerging from that and, but when it comes to for instance Louis Vuitton and I think Louis Vuitton, they've been very clear that Louis Vuitton for them is a cultural brand and he said that in annual results, he doesn't necessarily say that about all the other brands but Louis Vuitton for instance you have the foundation Louis Vuitton, it's called the foundation Louis Vuitton, not the foundation LVMH or the foundation, you know, Christian Dior. Even though Christian Dior, they have their own little museum at the flagship, you know, so there's that whole cultural aspect and you know when Jay-Z came to Paris, I think it was last year, he did an impromptu gig and that was at foundation Louis Vuitton. So, so maybe Louis Vuitton is in another, is in another sphere, right? So you have, so that's why you have somebody like Pharrell Williams who's going to be guiding a studio of very, very talented designers and he's going to give them the direction of travel, whereas for some brands like, you know, I think you've written a lot recently about Pueve and Jonathan Anderson, you know, it's all about the craft, it's all about the creativity and the innovation and how you can make your design stand out. And so, you know, I think with, and with the help of this fashion prize, they have a lot of room to grow and a lot of potential to spot really, really strong talent. Yeah, that is a really important part of this and that prize, it's at this point, I'd say the most prestigious. Obviously, there's one in, is it Yair? Is that how you pronounce it? Yes, yes. That one is good too, but obviously, special to be concentrated, to be able to go to Avenue Montaigne and see all of, all of that stuff.

I was at Vogue World on Sunday and obviously the amesement between the fashion industry and France and the government. And who, I've heard that many LVMH brands have tried to show on Plasmond Dome and not been able to. And so the fact that they did that, I think, is a testament to Anna Wittor and Vogue. So that's a whole other, that's another podcast. But if this election goes the other way, if LePen gets, if she gets elected, like what does that mean for the fashion industry? And for LVMH in particular, do you think that it's going to really decimate things or do you think that LVMH is so sort of smart about managing those relationships that they might be okay in the way that they tried to manage the relationship with Trump when he went in? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, to be honest, it's not just LVMH. It's the whole country who doesn't know what's going to happen come July the 8th after the second round of the elections. And the markets have been freaking out. I mean, last year, even LVMH lost more than 6%. That was the biggest loss in October. So there's a question mark for all of the business community. So for sure, for LVMH, there's question marks. So it's hard to see what's going to come out. But basically, as a businessman, Bernard Arnaud, he's been, he's adapted. He tells you he's met every single president since Ronald Reagan in the US. He met Donald Trump when they opened the Louis Vuitton leather goods manufacturing plant in Texas. That was in 2019. They do business in China, which is run by the CCP. They do business in the Gulf, which is run by shakes. So he's a business animal. He's not a political animal. And LVMH and all its brands is an asset for France. He feels like he's an ambassador for France. So any party who's in government would be silly not to take them into account and to destroy what it's amazing for France to have LVMH really. But isn't there a chance that this person is silly and wants to destroy things? I mean, look what Trump did with taxes and things and importing and made it very difficult for wine, French wine, things like that. I don't know enough about your government to know what damage could be done. But do you think that there is going to be some sort of, if Le Pen gets in, that new regime is going to make it very difficult for Bernard Arnaud to be as rich as he is? Again, very hard to foresee. But what I know is that the harshest sort of when it comes to imposing taxes on the wealthy will come as part of the program of the hard left, not the hard right, what I can say right now. And then the rest we'll see when it comes to visa. Visa for talent, we'll see. If France is welcoming for young designers, we'll see. It's hard to say. Well, good luck to you on, I guess, it's Sunday and then the next Sunday after that. Brad, I have one question. Were you inspired to buy a Dior Navy suit after you saw all the Arnaud boys wearing them? Angelina and I have a photo with Mr. Arnaud. And it's, and I, my joke is that he's wearing Dior, a Dior suit and a turtleneck and Berluti shoes and a Louis Vuitton watch. And I'm next to him in my suit supply coat and my Nordstrom rack shoes. Oh, we got to get you a new suit. There's a little bit of an unfortunate juxtaposition there. But yes, I would say I am, my eyes have been opened to the possibilities for, let's just say, fashion growth in my own life. Can I recommend a brand to you, OffiSeen General, which is OffiSeen General. Is that how you say it, Angelina? Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. It is not that expensive. And you can get a nice blue suit. It might be a little too fashion-y. I didn't know that I would be getting sartorial advice on this podcast, but I love giving it. I appreciate it. I'm going to write that down. Thank you both so much for being here. This was really fun. And congratulations on the relaunch and on the piece. I think I was very impressed that this was your choice. Thank you, Lauren. Thank you very much. Fashion People is a presentation of Odyssey in partnership with Puck, hosted by Lauren Sherman. That's me. Our executive producers are John Kelly, co-founder of Puck, and Ben Landy, executive editor at Puck. Edited and mixed by Patrick Antonetti and mastered and produced by Bob Tabadour. Special thanks to the team at Odyssey, including J.D. Crowley, Jenna Weis-Burman, Mattie Sprung-Kaiser, Josephina Francis, Hilary Schuff, and Kurt Kourtney. Each spring, 23 Pulitzer Prizes are awarded for Distinguished Journalism, Books, Drama, and Music. There was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll, and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination, go into creating their prize-winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out. It was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th. Follow and listen on Apple Podcasts, the Odyssey app, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcast.",
