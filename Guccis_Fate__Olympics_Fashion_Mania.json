And today with me on the show is top luxury analyst, Lukasoka, to discuss what's really happening behind the scenes at LVMH, Caring, Hermes, and more. We'll also get into the Paris Olympics and of course there's a rumor of the week. Let's get started. Hey everyone, I hope you're good. Unlike every other person who moves to Los Angeles from the East Coast, I am not on the East Coast right now or in Italy, nor in Croatia. I'm just hanging in Northeast LA steadily acquiring an array of swimsuits to wear to the pool. I'm not a beach person, so for years I had like one sad swimsuit that should have been replaced like several years before it was. But now that I joined this pool club, I've re-upped. And you know what? J-Cruise is still the best. They have the best selection. The best range of styles. I also got a swimsuit from Target that was really cute. All of the swimsuits that I've gotten basically have been under $40. I did buy a more expensive one and honestly, the J-Cruise are the best. Anyway, I also wanted to shout out my new friends that sat next to it, the Chateau Marmont on Saturday night for dinner. Friend is a strong word, but they stormed in with their Alexander McQueen bag. I really want to know what they bought. And freshly purchased matching Prada sunglasses and proceeded to FaceTime every person they had ever met. My friends and I were like very deep in conversation. If we hadn't been, if I had been bored, I would have probably like trolled them, but I just let them go. It was very amusing. They did end up getting escorted out, which I was sort of surprised. I really only noticed the bags and the stuff. They weren't bothering us, but it was very funny. This past weekend, I also watched a bit of the Olympics just a bit. I'm going to have a lot of time, but I did do a good amount of reporting that's in line sheet and I shared reactions from insiders on the ground about everything from the LVMH of it all. I got good details on the private opening ceremony party hosted by Bernard Arnaud to the state of the uniforms, which everybody is very passionate about and cares deeply about. I hope you enjoyed that. Luke and I also get into the Olympics. I guess the final thing I will say is I sort of wish I had gone. It's actually pretty empty. Four million fewer people flew there, came in than they had expected. I love Paris. It's my third home, I would say. It might have been fun. I kind of am like, maybe we should have just set up shop there for three weeks, the family. But oh well. Let's get going with Luca. Luca, welcome back to fashion people. Where are you that the Wi-Fi is so bad? Undisclosed location? I'm in the Riviera in the city of Italy. You and every other European. Yeah, exactly. There's too many people trying to use the Wi-Fi and mobile infrastructure is what it is. Well, you deserve a holiday after last week because it was basically every single luxury brand's earnings came out in the span of about four days. That is true. We're going to have Prada tomorrow, but after that we're done and we would all be taking a little bit of time off. Prada, very exciting. So let's talk big picture first. Because last week I think really told the story of what's happening in luxury, consumer-wise, business-wise, all that stuff. What was your big takeaway from all the earnings that came out last week broadly? Big picture, not speaking about any specific company just yet. I think that the big picture is that we are in a sticky cold loader. After all, but it's not so surprising that the central banks were increasing rates for a reason that they wanted global demand to cool down in order to bring inflation under control. And, you know, and be careful what you wish for because that is indeed what is going on. We've seen that in the broader luxury goods sector, but we're also seeing it in staples. So the picture is that of growth in consumption reducing. Still positive when it comes to the luxury goods space, but only marginally so. And again, this compounds, I think, some of the macroeconomic concerns that are affecting China at the moment and has seen any normal figure-call slowdown. The slowdown is coming from the bottom of the social pyramid. So we're starting to see moderation in aspirational consumer demand first. And at the moment, the high-end consumers are still quite buoyant. But if the Google slowdown was to continue at some point, we would have a higher end potentially following a similar path. Yeah. So right now, the big challenge is that aspirational luxury consumer in the U.S. and the growing upper middle class in China, those are the two groups. Would you say that the luxury brands are really relying on that have pulled back in the last year? I think so. And of course, there's many different consumer segments contributing to growth. And we've seen the high-end becoming more and more important for the luxury goods industry over the past 10 years. But for sure, the industry is quite broad. And there's definitely significant exposure to the American middle class, to the rising Chinese middle class. And what we're seeing at the moment is more muted growth in those two areas. So one narrative that I've seen going around quite a bit in all the reporting on this is this Japan the Week Yen is sort of saving China or saving the luxury industry in greater Asia at the moment because a lot of tourists are going to Japan and buying luxury goods. Do you think that's the right narrative? It feels a little like it's a band-aid for what's happening and you can't really give it that much credit. But curious what you think of the boom in China right now after so many years of it being in the background. I think Japan is clearly contributing to distort tourists and shopping flows. The Japanese currency being as weak as it is, it's putting luxury goods companies between a rock and a half place. If they increase prices too much, they cut off the local domestic consumer as prices would become too expensive in Japanese yen. But if they don't do that, they experience another launch of demand, as you say, tourists. Now these are individuals traveling to Japan and buying stuff. In the process, quite a big chunk of it, I expect is professionals organizing a trade between Japan and China. This is at a level which is unprecedented because normally you would see that practice in Japan would be at least 15%. It's not more expensive than in Europe. Today you have that by and large there on a par. That is a very close trip to Europe that the Chinese can take because finding the European practice in Japan is very compelling indeed. We've seen a huge amount of growth in Japan because Chinese consumers are traveling there and because some Congyis are traveling there. So destinations like Hong Kong and Macau would normally be relevant for Chinese tourists are no longer so relevant. That is because Japan is more compelling. Got it. Let's go through the list of some of the big companies that reported last week. I want your quick take on how they're doing. Let's start with the big one, LVMH. What do you think about they sort of missed expectations but generally everybody thinks they're fine. What was your big takeaway from their earnings last week? They have the most important division which is fashion leather goods. Most importantly, there's a profit contribution that continues to be in positive organic growth territory, albeit by 1%. That is clearly a major slowdown in comparison to what we had seen last year. We should have the benefit of significantly easier comps as we move into the second half in the first half of last year. Organic growth and fashion leather goods was higher than 20%. So quite comparable. The market was only half satisfied with its performance as we've seen in terms of share price moves that have been made to suffered. Do you think that the general investor, there was that Bloomberg report a couple weeks ago where it was like, don't invest in any stocks, don't buy any stocks that are relying on China in any way. And so many European big stocks are and so LVMH was clustered into that group. Do you think the general investor is just wary of anyone who is heavily penetrated in China right now? Possibly so. Even if I would like to point out that LVMH was saying that Chinese spend globally for them was increasing to the tune of 10% in the first quarter and close to that level, which I take means eight or 9% in the second quarter. So if they produce 1% globally and if they are experiencing a Chinese spend growth, again globally by eight or 9%, that can only mean that other nationalities are contracting. So is the problem really with the Chinese? Well, yeah, to some extent, especially if you look at China's geography, you see that that market is contracting most companies in the luxury good sector. But again, we go back in full circles to what I was saying in the initial remarks of our exchange, which is we're facing a global, particularly called slowdown. For sure, the Chinese have their own issues. They're experiencing very low levels of consumer confidence. The real estate market has played against them. But when you talk to LVMH, they're still saying that Chinese spend is up, which clearly is not the case for American spend, for example. And not in a way was to be expected because what we had in the past few years was a huge buy in European and American luxury spend. So there was at some point an idea that appetite could be associated, especially as the higher interest rates are weighing heavy on discretionary spend compared to environmental. Each spring, 23 Pulitzer Prizes are rewarded for distinguished journalism, books, drama and music. There was disbelief and pride and life changing. My name is Nicole Carroll, and I'm a member of the Pulitzer Board and host of Pulitzer on the Road, the official podcast of the Pulitzer Prizes. In each episode, winners reveal how much labor and risk, heart and imagination go into creating their prize winning work. We'll talk with novelists and reporters. We found stuff that no one had heard before, found out it was exciting. Critics and playwrights. I do not want to live in a world where we don't go on a stage and tell the truth about who we are. And columnists who've risked their lives to speak truth to power. What moral right would I have to call on my fellow Russian citizens to stand up to the Putin dictatorship if I didn't do it myself? The second season of Pulitzer on the Road premiered March 10th. Follow and listen on Apple Podcasts, the Odyssey app, Spotify or wherever you get your podcast. What do you think of the LVMH presence at the Olympics? Have you been following that? And what do you think that says about the group in the eyes of the consumer? The Olympics is definitely a way to be seen and be in front of a huge global audience. I think that sports like art is one of the global languages that everyone would be resonating through excellence in sport performance is something you would want to be associated to no matter whether you're in the West, in the East, in China, in Russia, wherever. So my view is it is a good opportunity to be sort of parading the brand in front of a global audience. It is clearly expensive, which makes sense in the case of LVMH. LVMH leads with scale and therefore has deep pockets to sustain expenditure like that and acquire even higher visibility in the eyes of consumers. It seems to be a good investment to build brand desirability over the medium term. Got it. Did you watch it all? I did. I did not then fall because we were very busy as you reminded me with the company of data, which has more time to watch TV in the past week or so, but I've recorded a lot and I will show all catch-up with the opening ceremony in particular. I'm very curious to watch it all. What's your favorite sport to watch, Luca? I like a lot of different sports. I really enjoyed the most recent European athletics championship because it was a pleasure to watch athletes in various disciplines. Probably that is one of the four things I like the most, the athletics. Yeah, I like the swimming because it's over very fast. I have no attention span left. So moving on, let's talk about the really good results. Hermes, Montclair seemed pretty good, but I don't know how the market responded. But I'm curious if you have any big picture takeaways about Hermes and then also something like Montclair because I think they do share some qualities. And maybe all these companies try to ape Hermes, but maybe companies like Montclair and Brunello are actually aping the right things that they should be aping about Hermes. But let's start with Hermes and what the big takeaway was there other than that they can do no wrong in the eyes of many people. Hermes was in a way working as a plan. This was the reason why we upgraded a few months ago at Hermes to perform and have chosen Hermes as a best idea because in a slowdown, Hermes would be with a handful of other companies, including Ferrari, most likely in a position to blow through as they bring to the market less than the market could take, especially in their iconic leather goods offer. And indeed, I think that in as far as the second quarter is concerned, that's one of the facts that organic growth is a bit more than 13%. And that was a confirmation of the appeal of this brand and the desirability of this brand. What we find is that when you have a technical slowdown, consumers rather than reducing their spend on all of the brands, they concentrate spend on the top and most desirable brands and cut off their long list into short lists. And the good thing about Hermes is that they end up being in the short list and often at the very top of it. What was apparent looking at the details is that more aspirational product categories like for example, silk were on the back foot. And again, this dovetails with the idea that it's the middle class, it's the aspirational consumers being more on the back foot and therefore buying less. What leather goods, as you would expect, it would, was driving growth. So that was definitely a good thing in our eyes. And then of course, the other element we need to take into account is that in the past few years, brands have been very buoyant in terms of increasing their prices. And Hermes has kept a lot of their pricing upside in their back pocket and that was very convenient this year because prices at Hermes are contributing, like price increases are contributing close to 8% of the growth. So a very convenient support to have in a year like this when you see demand moderation. Yeah, so they weren't greedy all those years where they could have raised prices like crazy and then when they needed to raise prices, they were able to and it didn't free the consumer out. That's interesting. Exactly. So what's up with, I get the silks thing, I love scarves, but what's up with, I noticed the watches were down and I know Richemont had their earnings today. I'm sure I looked at your report really quickly. It sounds like Van Cleef and Cartier are doing great, but I'm really interested in the watch market in particular because this is anecdotal and also I'm sure there's some measurement that there's a growing interest in watches with like a 40, you know, a middle age 35 to 50 year old consumer who maybe had an Apple watch and is now trading up. I personally know like a lot of women and a lot of just French generally who are buying watches, but the watch market seems to be underperforming. I know it was down at Hermes and I feel like there was something similar at LVMH, but what's going on in that market overall that the numbers aren't great? Well, I think that there are many different reasons for that. One is that the publicly traded companies don't necessarily own the ET1. Watch brands, we were talking about Hermes and you could argue that in leather goods, this is the year one brand in watches. You have Rolex, you have Audemars Piguet, Capotex Philippe and they're all private companies. So my impression is that we have a bit of a distorted perception of how the category is doing because we have no visibility on the top end of the brands that are doing that. The other thing is, and I'm picking this up in Geneva, talking to people in the industry, but as manufacturing capacity has been added, Rolex products are more easily available and therefore the spillover of consumer demand that was benefiting other brands is longer as important as it used to be because people now want to buy a watch and buy a Rolex if they so wish. And so they have fewer reasons to go to potentially alternative brands that would have been a bit of a second best and a bit of a replacement of a Rolex watch. The third reason is that some of the watch markets that would typically be most important for the industry, say Hong Kong, for example, which accounts for close to 10% of global watch demand are on the back foot. So that is causing further ad wins. And when you sum all of these ad wins together, you get the picture that we saw at the Richmont and at the Mitch as well. And the watch group for that matter, watch group, I think, is clearly wrong footed by what is happening in the market because we said Chinese, we said middle class and watch group is overwhelmingly exposed to Chinese and middle class consumers in China. So they're in a way at the eye of the storm.

So let's go to the finale, which is caring. Luca, what are we going to do about caring? What's caring going to do? What's your take? What's going on there? It seems tough. Quite clearly, caring is making a huge effort to try and revive the fortunes of Gucci. We've seen that reviving brands in the context of products and consumer demand slow down is not easy. Caring is not alone in facing a tough predicament in this effort. If we look at Burberry and Ferragamo, we'll possibly see an even more difficult situation. What I think we should do, what I think it makes sense to do, is to continue to stay very close to caring and to be waiting for factual evidence that things are starting to turn. I don't think the bad it makes sense, especially in a cyclical slowdown to buy shares just because comps are getting easier. At the end of the day, what we need to see in order for the caring enterprise to work is an acceleration or a revival of Gucci's organic growth. I think that this part is postponed. We had a significant profit warning after the first quarter, but we had another profit warning after the first half. It's rushing to commit to carrying ahead of any factual evidence that thinks getting back to Gucci seems to be not prudent. We would rather err on the side of caution and wait for this revival, but at least provide green shoots. At the moment, we're still waiting. It's been a year since they hired Savado De Sarno. It'll be his second spring collection in September. If this is a private company, you give someone like this two or three years. This is a public company where most of the profits and most of the revenue is coming from this one brand. Do you think they need to hire someone else? Do you think they should fire him? Do you think they should give him more time? Do you think it has to do more with the fact that they are still restructuring the actual business itself? When the activist investors went after them last July, obviously Marco Bazzari exited. A lot of executives exited. They brought in a new team. They now have their leadership structure in CEO, deputy CEO, chief commercial officer, chief merchandising officer, chief brand officer. It seems like this is the team in place is pretty much what the team is going to be. How much longer do you think they have that they can wait to see if De Sarno's product hits before? Because remember when we did that call with you, with your a private call with your investors, and there were people on the call who were saying like, people were mixed. The China consumer didn't seem to be interested in it. The Western consumer did. Like what do you think they should do about him? Do you think that switching him out is going to solve the problems? I think that at the moment, the most important basic test is going to be in the second half. When the new handbag fits the stores, that in my view, should be the point at which a discussion like this could potentially be hard. The question is, is at that point Gucci going to start to gel? And is the new Gucci going to start to make sense in the eyes of consumers and be attractive to consumers so that we find this is the trap and we start to see a turning point in terms of consumer engagement, traffic and organic growth? Or is that not going to work? And is that going to foreshort of moving the trajectory of the brand? If that were the case, then clearly different scenarios would be considered. My question on the conference call to them was whether they have milestones in place and whether they would switch priorities because at the moment priority number one continues to be top-line growth at Gucci and reviving top-line growth at Gucci. But if at one point this growth was not forthcoming, one would need to look at profit and cash preservation, waiting for better times and maybe different setups in terms of how to drive this potential growth. I think the jury is still out. My question was that Burberry, the market sort of feedback was already there and it was clear that things were not working as planned and we had a change of CEO's as a consequence and possibly an adjustment in the sort of market strategy that Burberry had tried. And in the case of carrying, I think it's fair to say the jury is still out. And we have to see what happens in the second half in order to better anticipate what could potentially be the sequel in this current organization setup and strategy setup. Yeah, this is what my Monday line sheet story was about. There was this big rumor. This is our rumor of the week, Luca. There was this big rumor on Twitter and social media last week with there were all these screenshots about Jonathan Anderson's leaving Lowewe, leaving LVMH going to Gucci. I did a little reporting. I have no idea. I don't know if it's true or not. Maybe by the time we publish this, the truth will be set free. But for now, what I understand is that it's just fake news. But the thing that it made me, got me thinking was in the last few years, there has been this strategy of hiring a younger person and not even younger. That's a bad because Salvador D'Azarno I think is actually a couple years older than Jonathan Anderson, but maybe like one or two. But hiring an unknown, like a second in command and promoting them and making them into a first in command in the way that they did with Alessandro Michele at Gucci. But this is a McQueen. They did this at Bottega. Daniel Lee initially was, he had been at Salim for a long time. There's a lot of this sort of, let's hire the person behind the scenes, Shamina at or Shemina at Chloe is a similar thing. Peter at Elias similar. And sometimes it's really worked and these people have become famous. And sometimes it hasn't worked. And I'm just curious from your perspective, because they had such giant ambitions for Gucci, like what it was like a $10 billion year brand, they wanted to get it to 15. And that would require firing on all cylinders immediately. Do you think, and who knows, maybe they tried to hire Jonathan Anderson and LVMH was like, hell no, we're keeping our prize possession. Do you think carrying Gucci made the wrong decision by hiring an unknown who's aesthetic, he didn't have a fan base? Whereas if they had brought in Maria Grazia or Jonathan Anderson or Adi Salman, they would have had an immediate impact and been able to make over the brand immediately. Do you think from your perspective, from the market's perspective, were they expecting a big hit immediately? Or was there an understanding that this sort of slow down, maybe it's much slower than than anyone expected, but this sort of slow down was inevitable. And so it was better to bring someone on who was a bit more quiet and lesser known to temper expectations. I think that for certainty, you should be asking the company, my impression was that there was a sense that Gucci needed to take a breather and needed to consolidate the results. And so, contrary to what was attempted and successfully achieved in 2015-16 with a big bang of revolution at Gucci that immediately provided a huge boost to Gucci's fortunes. This time, I think the approach was more moderate. I think someone commented that the new collections were a sort of sobane between heavy courses that we had had with Sandra Michele with Gucci being very much characterized with a very strong aesthetics and maybe a need to integrate and adjust the data aesthetics which was difficult to achieve straight away. But for sure, I think that the expectation that there would be more time to consolidate and more time to potentially build a platform for a then more aggressive growth effort had been wrong footed because the decline in top line has most likely been a hand of what the company was expected. And I think that this is a fair assumption considering that they've come up to the market with two public warnings in a very limited amount of time. And I think the company was making this point during the conference for the one-off budgeting for this severe contraction that Gucci has experienced. So, clearly the environment has been unforgiving and this has made this idea and this plan of reviving Gucci more difficult to achieve and more costly to achieve in the end. Oh my, well, final question for you. By the time this publishes, the Prada results will be out, but what are you expecting from them? Is it going to be crazy 80% growth at Mu Mu again? I think Mu Mu is definitely entering into more difficult problems. So, I expect that this is still going to be very much resonating with consumers. There's no doubt about it, but possibly and definitely in the double digits, but possibly more lower than what we see in this so far. I think that Prada, like Montclair, is experiencing a very strong momentum and should continue to thrive on the back of that. It's not clear that that could produce significant operating leverage because my impression is that they're continuing to spend a lot to support this growth and as a consequence operating leverage could be more difficult to achieve, but we will soon know tomorrow where things are. We will know tomorrow or today or whenever you listen to this, it will already be out and you can look online. Final question for you, Luca. There's been a lot of talk these last few weeks and also the last few months of just like there are so many empty creative director positions. There are so many people waiting in the wings. No one knows what's happening at each brand. My perspective is that this is just a reflection of the changes in workplace culture overall and the fact that there are a lot of switcheroo's and people coming and going isn't totally connected to the fashion industry, but more just the way work is these days and people move jobs and things change over more quickly because the consumer moves more quickly. What do you make of it? Are you sort of waiting? Would you like to see Givenchy become a bigger part of the LVMH portfolio and get a big designer who can make that happen? What is your perspective of all these? Burberry, I noticed when I read your note on it, I felt the same way. Great that they change CEOs. That's a good first step. Josh Shulman is someone that I've reported on a lot and I'm interested to see what he does there, but also was expecting a change in creative. What do you make of all the sort of empty vacancies, all the vacancies in these roles and also the decisions people are making when they actually fill them? I think that when growth slows, you have more pressure on companies and the first and most important point of pressure is creativity because we're selling products that consumers have to desire and in order to be desirable, they have to be fresh. They have to resonate with the current side guys. They have to hit target. Being a creative director is a very difficult job and matching creative directors to brands is an even more difficult job. It's not so surprising that in the slowdown, there's a lot of churn in the creative department. That's the helm of the creative department as companies are trying to get as much growth as they possibly can. Fresh. That's a great word, Luca. I feel like that's what's going on. Luxury feels very stale right now. They need to add some freshness to the proceedings. Thank you so much for taking the time. I hope you have a lovely holiday after the Prada earnings and I hope that they go well so that everybody makes some money. Thank you very much indeed, Lauren. Apologies again for the technical difficulties. Take care. All good. We'll talk soon. Thanks for everything, Luca. Bye-bye. Bye.
