And today with me on the show is fashion editor and newsletter writer extraordinaire Becky Malinsky. We're talking Burberry's new CEO, luxury brands at Limbledon, Loewe's new campaign, and the dress that's taking over Washington, DC. Plus, the rumor of the week. Let's get started. Hi everyone. I hope you had a great weekend or at least a relatively peaceful weekend. I was up late on Sunday night when news of this Burberry CEO change up broke. So I scrapped that column. It'll probably run Thursday and dug into some Burberry analysis. Fortunately, I did not sleep much, but Becky and I are going to get into it on the show today. My big thought is that Josh Shulman, the new CEO, is the right person to lead this brand or the right type of person to lead this brand. It could say the same for Jonathan Ackroyd, who also has a really good reputation, but obviously things need to change. That is my big picture thought and we'll get into it more with Becky in Line Sheet on Monday. I have my Burberry analysis plus with a lot of good intel, plus some Cond√© updates, a funny little story on the Jack Schlossberg Vogue contract if you're interested in those sorts of things. We also talk a bit about a new styling duo in Milan. Alastair McKim is joining Moschino as the lead stylist under the new designer. So Adrian Appalazza, what does that mean for Moschino? What does that mean for Italian fashion? I talk a bit about that. So hope you enjoy it. This episode with Becky is really fun. We thought we would have nothing to talk about and of course we had so much to talk about. So let's get going. Becky Malinzi, welcome back to Fashion People. Thank you for having me back. How are you? What did you buy this weekend? Did you buy anything? Oh my God, always. Yes, I bought a pair of neon pink Chanel t-strap flats with bejeweled chachis on them. You actually sent me a picture of these and you first sent me a picture of them on the RealReal and said, should I buy these? And we didn't get to you on time so you just bought them. But I would have said yes obviously because I'm an enabler. But I love them. What are you going to wear them with? So at the same time I also bought this little white nightgownie dress from Dosa also on the RealReal and the same purchase, spree. Nice. And I'm going to wear them together. I love this. Perfect. Yeah. As usual, I thought there was going to be no news and I was sort of trying to make the news when I was sending you ideas. And there has been a big news break overnight. Burberry is a new CEO. We're going to get to that. But beforehand, I wanted to talk to you about Wimbledon. Marissa Meltzer and I discussed it last week, but neither of us are big tennis people. And also the fashion was pretty bad the first week. But this last week, the luxury brands have really sort of infiltrated. They presented themselves. Yes. The court. And I was curious if you thought any of the looks are good. What you were. You are a player and a watcher of tennis, correct? Yes. Yes. I'm more a player than a watcher. But I of course love to watch what the watchers are wearing. Yes. What did you think? Who looked good? Who didn't look so good? Oh my gosh. Well, Kirsten Dunst looks so good. And I cannot find who makes her dress. It was very interesting to see. You could kind of tell who dressed themselves and who had a stylist. So that was also interesting. It seemed like she wore a dress that she had. Maybe that's not true. So the thing about Kirsten Dunst that I always say is she clearly has personal style. Correct. That's helpful. Even when she's wearing, she now works with Gucci. So maybe it was Gucci. I don't know. It had a bow on the shoulder. I need to find her. I don't know. Please find it. I'm dying to know. Oh, it's so cute. It's so cute. She's wearing Gucci's shoes and bag, which looked good. And a Chanel watch. I mean, that, she looks great. She looks so good. She really does. This is a dress that she would have worn when she was 28. This is a dress when maybe not 19 when she was Kirsten Dunst. Do you remember that? Yeah, of course. We're the same age. I understand. Yeah. That person when I was 19. I loved her like back page and Teen Vogue, like, you know, in their bedroom with her brother. I still remember that. It just came to me. I don't know why. She looked really good though and it might be Gucci. Okay. It's not labeled like on any, I've looked everywhere on Twitter on all of the style roundups. I cannot find anyone who has labeled it. It's like Kirsten Dunst's in Gucci shoes and bag. Okay. Then maybe it's vintage. I could see that. She wears a lot of vintage. She looks great. But she looked great. Also on polka dot note, I loved Marco Robbie and Alaya. Oh yeah, she looked cute. Though I didn't like the shoes. They were very severe for a daytime sporting event. They're like a really harsh black Alaya Mule, which I get it. It's a full look, but the dress was so cute and it would have been so much better with like maybe an Alaya flat, like the mesh ballet flat or something. Agreed. Are you still pro mesh flats and jelly sandals and jelly mesh sandals? I was never pro jelly of like buying the jelly. I was never going to buy the jelly. I did not even buy the ancient Greek version of the jelly, but I think the mesh does look really nice. I'm still into it and it's still, it's a bit more subdued. So you could just wear it and have non-fashion people not notice it. I don't know if it's a jelly, it's a fashion statement, but I think that would have been better with the mesh ballerinas. Great, great note for, for Marco Stylist. Yeah, sorry, Marco Stylist. Andrew Moncumal. He'll never listen. It's fine. I liked Zendaya, but. Only she could do that. Yeah. The thing I will say is I'm not a tie fan. Yeah, me neither. Everything else I loved, like that look I loved. I thought that the blazer and the shirt and the jeans and the Louis Vuitton were really good. She wore ties two times and then a Ralph Lauren full suit, I think. No? Yeah. Yeah, I think it was all Ralph, but she was wearing an LV bag. Okay, interesting. She was wearing it. The day she wore like blazer jeans. I thought that was cute and like untied tie. I thought that was good. Yeah. Yeah, I'm just not, I thought Glenn Close looked good. I thought all the Ralph Lauren men looked great. Generally Ralph, this is Ralph Lauren's time, like a tennis matcher. So it was good, but yeah, I'm just not, I cannot get into ties on women and it feels like I hate even saying that, but it just looks costuming. I think it does this. It has the same issue that I think vests have in that there is no actual functional purpose of it on a woman. So it, no matter what looks overly accessorized, like I feel similarly about vests. I think vests are a very hard thing to wear because it just looks like you added something because you needed to add, you wanted to add something as opposed to this looking like an easy thing you put on. Like you had to think about that. So it will never look effortless. So you have to be very careful with an element like that. Yeah. Yeah, I feel like when people wear Tom Brown, because that is so specific anyway, that it is a little bit easier and there are people. Willa Bennett looks good in one because it's her personal style. Again, it comes back to personal style. I also thought that Julia Roberts husband looked really good. He did look good. Danny Motor. He did look good. Yeah. I mean, that was a great bet she made. Great job, Julia. She looked cute too, but he looked great in that. The men in general looked better because I think so many people leaned on to tailoring and just men looked good when they get dressed. Yeah. What do you think of Joe Allen's Bottega collab? I just got an alert for his like, Wimbledon look. Oh, he looks great. Yeah. I thought he looked good. I like that they have partnered with him. Yeah. He looks fantastic. So funny. It's so tricky. The Navy and White, so many people trying to play on Navy and White and it can look costuming so quickly. This looks very easy, effortless, even though he's clearly very styled, you know, he's wearing double button downs, sleeves, rolls. Looks great though. Yeah. Yeah. I thought he looked good. Sunglasses look good too. Perfect size. Yeah. I'm into this new friendship between Bottega and Joe Allen. Yeah, it's nice. Who is in a new movie apparently that I will never see. I was looking at Bottega this morning actually, just looking at their website. I think I was looking at it because I was thinking a lot about Burberry, which we can come back to, but the product is just good and interesting and looks good on white. You know, like these clothes look nice. I agree. I agree. This show is brought to you by Bottega, the brand on a mission to inspire more mindful oral care because when you take care of your mouth, your whole body benefits. Bottega's magic ingredient is called Enha is a form of calcium that makes up 97% of your tooth enamel and 70% of your dentin. Bottega's toothpaste are fluoride free, but best of all, they come in delicious flavors. Adults like you and I love elevated flavors like cocoa, ginger, lemon, lavender and element. Well, our kids will love fun flavors that offer the same efficacy and are also safe to swallow like orange cream and strawberry mango.

Make the switch to Bottega for the whole family at B-O-K-A.com. That's a great segue to our next topic, which is Burberry, whose designer Daniel Lee used to design Bottega Veneta and has been designing Burberry for the last two years. I would say pretty unsuccessfully, regardless of whether or not it's his fault. That's another question, but the brand itself has just not hit a stride. He was so, he came in hot at Bottega and it was super successful, super fast. And then abruptly left and then almost as abruptly took this job at Burberry and it just hasn't. It's not totally wrong, but it doesn't feel right either. And now they announced last night, I was unfortunately awake at midnight that they fired the CEO, Jonathan Ackroyd, who, you know, has a really good reputation. But I think the macro climate plus, they were trying to move Burberry up market even further than they already had with designer Ricardo Tishi. It's just been really challenged. They were down like 20% for stores, comparable store sales. So stores that have been open at least a year were down 21% in this past quarter. And I think the board just really felt like they had to make a change. But the interesting thing is in the board meeting, the chairman said they kind of said that they're not going to move Daniel Lee out of the position, even though it doesn't feel like correct, like totally the right fit. The new CEO is this guy, Joshua Schumann, who is a luxury and aspirational luxury veteran. He ran Bergdorf Goodman, but he also ran Jimmy Choo and he also ran coach and he also ran Michael Kors. So he is sort of in that upper middle market expertise. And it just, I was kind of like, Oh, well, they hire Josh, they're definitely going to hire a new designer. And it sounds like if that happens, it's not, it might not happen immediately. But from your perspective, you're looking at these brands and sort of observing them from, you're buying them for clients. You're looking at them as a fashion editor. You're looking at them as a consumer yourself as fashion of fashion. And what do you think about what's happening at Burberry? And what does it say about the like greater challenges in the market right now? We had so many questions. Well, I think the appointment felt very obvious. It's like, Oh, OK, you want Burberry to be coach now? OK, got it. But I think just with Burberry and where they've been, I don't think about it much. I think there is so much competition now and people are very angry about prices. And like the product has to be really good. And I don't think about it much, which I kind of want to go back to what you were saying about how he experienced sort of immediate success at Bottega Veneta, because I think like I think that is true with accessories and handbags. Like he like sort of blew that category out overnight and everything was so hyper popular so quickly. But I thought the clothes were really difficult, even there. And I think that translated to Burberry as well. Like the clothes were really difficult and confusing and hard to understand. And when I think about Burberry, the first thing I still think about is Christopher Bailey and his amazing dresses. And like, like that's still what I think. I'm like, Oh, Burberry, remember all those dresses like they made. They made great clothes and just really good dresses. And I know that sounds crazy and specific, but like everyone wore those and loved those. And they were easy to wear and buy. And I mean, the British market specifically is very needs real clothes and dresses and clothes for getting dressed in a very conservative way. So to play on British heritage and to kind of, I don't know, in my opinion, it needed that. Yeah, I think of the trench. I also think of that Christopher Bailey era and the art of the trench. But I think obviously the trench. I don't really think about the dress itself because I really doubt that was a huge part of the business. But I do think about the trench coat. And I think that's what their whole business should be based on. Like Montclair's is based on that jacket. Trying to do that. No, recently, they did it when Christopher Bailey was there. And then they tried when they hired Marco Gabeti from Celine and Ricardo Tishi from Givenchy. They tried to elevate once again and make it more about the bags. So that's when they started doing that B bag. I don't know what it's actually called. But and then this last iteration, the interesting thing is they keep talking about it, moving it abruptly up market. But they were already doing that with Marco and Ricardo. I with Daniel Lee, my thing is. It needs a merchandiser. It when I went to the showroom in Paris and the clothes are like fine, but they're not merchandised well. And it also the prop the handbags and shoes do not feel unique or memorable in any way. And I also don't think the handbag market is so tricky right now that I actually don't think there's any hope of them gaining a foothold in that. And clearly, you're totally right about Daniel Lee at Bottega. The bags and shoes were immediate hits. And he clearly had some sort of great collaboration with a handbag designer there who does not work with him at Burberry. I mean, maybe I'm wrong. But to me, it's always about the creative director and the person who works on that specific product. And it feels. It doesn't feel like there's any sort of collaboration between those two people there. The other thing is I agree on the clothes. I did buy something from his first collection that I don't wear a lot because it is hard to wear. It's like stiff and and it's just it requires work on my part. It's a it's a scoop neck jacket jacket that Ali Pugh from Bottega. A friend and I both have from you bought in a Bottega. I see. Yes. And I thought the clothes, at least the clothes there had a big idea. I I don't I haven't been offended by the clothes and I haven't seen a collection on a runway in person. So that creates a whole different thing. And I think people have seen it in person and liked it more. But from online. The clothes at Burberry and the collections, they just I haven't thought they were terrible, but they didn't have it. There's no big idea there. And he he just there was a big idea at Bottega, whether you liked it or not. And so I just I think it's a mismatch that the interesting thing is the way that the the chairman of the board. Talked about it, Jerry Murphy talked about it in the meeting was in the earnings call was like, we're not changing our strategy. We're staying up market. It he made it sound like Daniel's not leaving. The problem is, and Lucas Olca said this in his note, the analyst, that if you move up market, it doesn't work. You have to discount a bunch. And they already are so reliant on off price, like all these sort of upper middle market brands that it's even worse right now. And so I I hope what they're doing by hiring Josh, who has managed a lot of brands of this ilk, but also understands the luxury market is bringing someone in who is going to focus on merchandising and making things that people want. Like you're talking about dresses. I feel like the entire market is hungry for dresses. Consumers are hungry for dresses. Yeah, I think what you were talking about their their sense of brand identity is not there. Whereas I feel like it really was. Honestly, I still look at Burberry as a Christopher Bailey brand. So like the idea of heritage and tradition and a really functional wardrobe, which yes, of course, goes back to the trench. It doesn't it doesn't feel like there's any narrative there at all. So hopefully they can find that and play on it. But it is. I don't know what the answer is. Obviously, the up market, down market. I think obviously coach did not start in the luxury positioning that Burberry is starting from. So that will be interesting to see how they play off each other when he gets there. What his strategy is. But for me, it will always come back to the product has to be great. It has to, you know, I have to want to think of it. So where's the desire effect and where are the things that we can actually buy that feel special? Yeah. And that kind of hooks into this bigger issue in the market right now. So Brunella Cuccinelli did their earnings last week. They're really good. They are, everything's looking good. I think they were up 14%. This year, I mean, the outlook is slightly muted because of the issues in China, but generally still pretty good. Their, their stock did not pop. Like the, the market is so wary of luxury right now, especially because of the China challenges. There was a big piece in Bloomberg last week that basically said, don't buy European stocks that are exposed in China. And that means a lot of luxury stocks because it's not good in China and the market's not going to be good anytime soon. And to me, it speaks to this bigger issue of luxury fatigue, which I've been talking about for like two years and felt it coming on of this idea of like, people don't need anything and they also have things to do other than sit at home on their computer and buy stuff. And so they are once again, it's kind of what was happening pre pandemic is picked up again, like they're spending more money on. Plastic surgery and going out to dinner or buying Osepik or, you know, all of these different things. And there's something that's happened that like, unless you're a fashion enthusiast, you're, you've backed away from buying. It doesn't feel as fun to buy, buy stuff. And I think a big reason for that is because the market, there's just like so much boring product on the market. Have what are you observing in all your different roles in that way? Do you think that the big brands are sort of in crisis? Do you think that they that this is just sort of a blip that has to do more with market conditions? Probably a combination of all of them. I mean, the big brands are very, very eager to get people into stores like that. You know, I get a lot of inquiry wanting me to come in and look at product for clients all the time. Like people really want people in the stores and I don't think people are coming into stores in general. So I think brands are a little nervous about that. I think obviously price has something to do with it. Even if money is not an object, you just don't want to feel insulted by some of this and people are starting to feel that way. So that's definitely part of it. The world is on fire. You know, we don't know what's going on with elections all over the world and what future economies are going to look like. And what you said, I mean, I was talking to a friend this week who was like, it's all going towards beauty and personal improvement in that way. A lot of budget going that and that's what's making people feel good outside of clothes. And yeah, I'm very curious about all of that. And I was texting with you and someone else this morning, you know, about just how sick I am of seeing brand names all over everything. So that sort of feels like panic to me from the brand. So like what customer are you reaching for that you feel like everything has to say your brand name? So is it are are you guys desperate for a new younger consumer who's obsessed with name brand? Or like what is the play there that every single thing lately feels like it has a brand name on it? Which obviously like quiet luxury was a blip, but that was a blip like even La Ropiana selling hats at say La Ropiana, you know, by the thousands. Yes. Yeah, I think that in part it's a copycat of Prada Mew Mew and the success they've had with like slapping that those logos on every single thing. And it's true. I am that's really the only and this brand comes up so much on this on this podcast and in my writing, but it's really the only brand that I'm comfortable with wearing a logo thing because it's like part of the design. And it's a little tongue in cheek. That being said, like they need to watch it too. And I'm very curious. I wouldn't wear that triangle. I like I'm a number one Prada fan of all time. I consider myself like in the top 1% of Prada fans and I won't wear that triangle. And I have clients who love all of the Mew Mew, you know, like Mew Mew, they can't keep in stores, but will not wear Mew Mew on their jacket. You know, if like they're getting their portrait taken like they their blazer can't say Mew Mew. So it's it's obviously that's not their target market. No, it's a great point. And I am curious to see how their earnings are. They come out July 30th. But I think that that is part of it. They've seen the success. And and the problem with so many of these kind of lesser brands is they do just copy what is successful in the market and they don't think about what is what is right for them. And I mean, that's exactly what Burberry's issue has been and and all of these other companies. And and it is one one that I think hasn't resorted to that in the same way as Loewe, which released this incredible campaign this weekend. Jonathan Anderson, the designer released it, I think on his personal Instagram first. Daniel Craig, Gretta Lee, his longtime muse, Daniel Craig is starring in the new Luca Guadagnino movie Queer, which I think Jonathan is also doing the costumes for. So it's this full circle collaboration shot by David Sims, who I feel like doesn't do as much as he used to. He used to be, I feel every single campaign. And now maybe it's a little more select. But. Well, it looks so because David Sims photographs are really sharp and really three dimensional. And I loved it. And what did you think? Yeah, I thought it was really fun. Also, it was released on first on video as video. I didn't even see that. That's what I noticed first. I mean, on Instagram, where we all view all of this first, but I noticed it first as video. Yeah, that's very interesting. It's very dynamic. And this collection was so this collection was so well received. But, you know, Loewe is probably over a billion dollars a year in sales at this point, but that's still small in the LVMH portfolio. What do you think they've done right with that brand to get it to this point specifically? I mean, they consistently deliver beautiful, innovative bags in a category that is very hard to reinvent the wheel. Like they're the bags are so good and they they consistently are and they don't feel overplayed quickly and they don't all feel like a take on an Hermes bag, which so many bags do. So I think that's really interesting and innovative and they use their runways to go absolutely crazy. But yet there's still product to buy. So I think a lot of it is very seamless, like the website is a nice experience. They're selling the clothes that they're showing. They're also giving us creativity. They're also using interesting casting in the ad campaigns. They're challenging traditional ideas of beauty. You know, he he is an innovator. The challenge for other brands who want to copy Loewe is it's not as easy as copying Prada's slapping of the of the logo. And they also they were they were basically started from nothing. So the fact that it's it's done well when they have access to LVMH's retail network and all of that. But it's been a decade as someone who works with them said the culture caught up. It wasn't that Jonathan just suddenly started being good. The culture caught up to him and I thought that was a really smart way of putting it. But it was it was a really fun sort of salve over the weekend, given that, you know, it's been crazy here in the US and it was just a nice sort of pop of. I don't want to say pop of creativity. That sounds extremely lame, but it was just like a burst of something that felt new and interesting. I don't know. That's always nice. Yes. And something that will challenge you. So I think they have that balance between viability and like hype and hysteria. I did you read Rachel Tashin's article this weekend in the post about the marvelization of fashion about like, yes, brands are not creating to sell. It's selling the selling. So they are able to balance that really well, sort of. So I guess they do a really good job of that. Though I still think they suffer from a bit of logo mania as well. One dress that is popular right now that doesn't have a logo is this dress that I wanted to take on this dress that is apparently just all over Washington, DC. And I did make a couple of calls last week to confirm that. And it was confirmed that this Tucker, this dress by a brand called Tucker Nuck. If you, if you've never heard of it, it's like a local DC Georgetown store. And they have this dress called the Jackie. It's $300. It looks like a vintage sort of dress that like Jackie Kennedy would have worn that type of thing. It's everywhere apparently. And the interesting thing was this, this reporter from Axios Victoria Knight. Tweeted it and she said, someone needs to do an expose day on the absolute chokehold the Tucker Nuck shift dress has on the Capitol Hill girlies right now. And so I, I looked into it and the interesting thing was I looked through the comments and there were always people being like, there's dupes on Amazon. And the reporter saying, oh yeah, it's so expensive, $300. And look, my feeling about this dress, it's perfectly fine. These, I have a little item about this in line sheet and the, the women who started this company are interesting. And, you know, I'm, I'm happy for them that their, their product is selling. If I, if I were anyone buying this, I would just buy something from St. John on sale or buy a Tory Burch dress that feels, this feels like very speed of costuming, the theme of the day. I just feel like it looks like a vintage dress and that, you know, you, you want to look modern, but as someone who's buying stuff for high power executives, probably some who go to DC a lot, if they don't live in DC, what do you think about it? And what do you think it says that it, that this dress in particular, which is very nostalgic looking is hitting so hard in our nation's Capitol. I'm super curious about this company. I mean, one, I think you might go look for a dress that St. John and vintage, but the idea of a dress like this, that doesn't have a waist, that has sleeves, that is semi-conservative, but in a fun color and $300 is such an important sweet spot for so many places like DC, like Atlanta, like Charlotte, where there still is a culture of getting dressed and wearing dresses and it's I was actually shocked. I went onto their website recently and they have like, they carry like 300 brands. I thought this was like an SEO based company, basically, like, I mean, they must be spending a million dollars a year. I think it's a mix. I think it's a mix. But yeah, they're, they're always popping up for me, like in the top, in Google searches and Google shopping, like they're always one of the first five. Oh, interesting. I think they're like just fashion adjacent enough, but enough removed that like they are filling a void of like the person who is not going to buy $800 high sport pants, but wants to be dressed and is getting dressed every day. I think they, and they make, they make very, they make real clothes. They're not pretending to be fashion. And I think it's a very interesting company. And you don't see a lot about them. Like you don't see their founders everywhere. You don't see them trying to play the fashion game. Like they're just making $250 dresses that are clearly selling like hotcakes. I had never heard of them before. I agree generally. And one, one profile on the founders said that they took six months. They went to, went to Mountain View for six months to study how to run a digital business before they launched in 2012. Yes. I mean, this is, this is a real flex and, and very interesting. So they clearly, it is, they have tons of brands, but it feels like that brand is the driver. And I, I did look up sales on the website and it, it is growing. It's not growing as fast as it was like a year or two ago, but it's still a growing business. I agree, but I think that not vintage, but buying St. John on sale or buying Tory, which to me, it feels like a sort of an alternative to Tory Burch, even though Tory Burch offers the same things, but with a little bit more of a design point of view, I think it's fine. And if you, there were people in this slack that were saying that $300 was too expensive for a dress. And I think that is the, that comes back to the bigger issue in our culture where, you know, I know I'm sure people on Capitol Hill don't make that much money, but is it okay to just buy a $1,500 dress that you wear three days a week, or do you need three $300 dresses that, or one $800 dress that you wear three days a week or three, or three $300 dresses, or, you know, I know rent the runway is really popular in DC for good reason because people have to dress up and wear different things every day or they feel like they have to. But I think the popularity of this dress, but also still the reticence to the price, which like is basically the cheapest that you should spend on a new dress. Like if you're spending less than that, I mean, most dresses at Zara cost that much too, right? I think the person who is buying this dress though, considers Tory Burch a designer dress, that's a much more special occasion. It's not the person who's. I think, but also this is someone who, you know, is going to wear, is going to buy three dresses because they might be on TV or they're on social media and they're Gucci bag and they're Chanel shoes. You know, so it's like this is a person who is spending their money on luxury accessories because they still are spending a bit on fashion. But they're not quite in fashion ready to wear, which obviously is a much more niche market. So we're generally pro the Tucker Knuck dress. Generally, yeah, I'm pro the Tucker Knuck dress. I'm pro people dressing up. I'm pro people dressing up and I'm pro brands that are creating clothes for real women's bodies and they like they actually do. I don't recommend them often, but I do have clients with specific body needs and they actually are a good resource for that. If you don't have a very specific waistline and your petite, like they make a lot of shift dresses, they make a lot of things with sleeves, like they do make nice shapes. Got it. Well, I'm excited to see their rise and their their future entrepreneur, Inc. or fast company magazine profile when they want to sell the company. Optimize your nutrition this year with Factor.

Really quickly, I wanted to do a rumor of the week. The challenge is there are so many rumors. It's just it's a wild, wild time. There isn't something that came up in my reporting in the last week that feels like we could really focus on. So I wanted to quickly, quick fire, go through the sort of up in the air stuff. So we've resolved LaVan, which you're excited about. I am excited. Yay for Peter Copping. He's going to make great dresses, great dresses and just romantic, pretty things. Great. So we can't wait to see what he does. Fendi, I hear it's it was still up in the air as of last week, but there is a chance that he will be renewed. Kim Jones will be renewed for another year. I heard this from someone close to him. Obviously this is Bernard Arnaud's decision, not ours. And also it's the hundred anniversary. So I think soon in the next year or two. So what would you like to see happen at Fendi? Don't don't even I would never expect you to speculate on whether or not Kim Jones's stay or going or the family. Like what do you want Fendi to be regardless of who the designer is? Oh my God, I think I want Fendi to be truly Italian. You know what I mean? I think I need some Italian sexiness from them. I want Italian cuckiness from them. Yeah. It's hard. It's hard to say because like Carl Agarfeld was in charge for so long. Yeah. But yeah, that's a tough question. Well, you had a good answer. So last one, Givenchy. Last one, Givenchy. Who is your pick? Who do you want it to be? I might well, haven't we already talked about that? We feel very strongly. It's going to be Sarah Burton, which I feel good about because I think she can, you know, like Givenchy historically is like very classic, beautiful women's clothes, like almost Dior new look, you know? So I want to see her make beautiful dresses and tailoring. And secretly Alexander McQueen used to have amazing tailoring under her, like that I bought those suits for clients and like and used it all the time in the journal. So I would like to see some of that from her. I'd be very happy with that. I agree. I think the full circle of him, Lee McQueen being the Givenchy designer at one point is an interesting thing too. The one question is, does she want her entire career to be linked to him? Which I don't know if she cares about that. She doesn't seem to be an ego driven designer in the realm of ego driven designers, in the spectrum of ego driven designers. But yeah, that's the one thing. But I agree. And the tailoring part and kind of going back to McQueen's Savile Row expertise and their early collaboration is a really interesting idea. And my understanding is that it is hers if she wants it or it was hers if she wanted it. And her showing up at that Paris, Vogue World Paris thing, she's not a person who just shows up to stuff for no reason. So she was there for a reason. And what that reason was hopefully will happen. But yeah, I'm pro. But also I'm just excited for whoever it's going to be. I really think they're going to make the right decision and it's going to be fun. There's been a lot of sort of mismatches in fashion in the last few years. And this feels like a chance to really write the ship and do something for a brand that that could be much bigger than it is. I just feel like she's a clothing first designer and I'd like she wants you to be a clothing first brand. So I don't know. And she's female. I just would like more women designers in the mix. I don't know. I'd be happy with that. I mean, when is someone going to finally tap Ashley and Mary Catole? And, you know, like, when is someone finally going to get them out of the row? I mean, it's probably the smartest business decision for them to not do anything else. And I don't think they want to do it. I'm sure they don't. I think they're so specific. So specific. But they can create the want and the need when you don't need anything. Everyone else seems to be challenged by that. They do not seem to be challenged by that. I agree. I mean, they could obviously do Armani and that would be the What a dream. Yeah, it might be two on the nose. Yeah, that's the only thing. But I agree. I mean, I think that they are are singular talents and I would be thrilled for them to do anything. But I think the row will get acquired before they take a job. I'm sure would be my guess. I'm sure I mean, someone should buy it. And if you're going to buy it, please call me. Becky, this was so fun. Thanks for joining me today. I hope you can come on soon and we can chat fashion again. Yeah, I hope there's lots going on for us to dive into. In the meantime, we're all just trying to stay cool. Yes, yeah, I like your floral top. It's it's very light and airy and you don't seem like you're sweating. So that's good. Oh, yeah, I've got the AC gun. Brutal out there. It is brutal out there everywhere. We'll talk soon. OK, bye.
