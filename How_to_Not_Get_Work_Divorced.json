I'll be around this weekend. I'm going to do a decent amount of things. Last night was the Cult 100 celebration at the Guggenheim, which included a bunch of performances. Sarah Harrelson, the editor-in-chief, included me on that list of culture shapers. I'm grateful to her. It was very sweet and made me feel good. Before the Cult 100, Eva Chen and I hosted a little from Metta, of course, hosted a little dinner at Fedora, which just reopened downtown, which was super fun. While it was off the record, like all of our Puck dinners, I can say that the Metta Ray Bands were discussed. Anyway, maybe I'll see you around this weekend. Thank you to Eva for making that dinner happen. She is a queen. Let's get going, though, with Mettaeus and Michael. I have a fabulous time chatting about their incredible body of work, especially, you know, they've shaped so much visual culture over the past few decades and have been very influential on all of us, more than you even know. And I don't know. I love talking to them. I hope you guys enjoy the conversation. Michael and Mettaeus, welcome to Fashion People. Hello. Thank you for having us. Thank you for being here. So on Friday mornings, the first question we ask is, what did you have for breakfast? I think I skip breakfast. I just had black coffee. On breakfast, I had like a muffin, resin muffin that I bought on the Market Bio, Bio Market on Boulevard Raspay. And I went straight after I landed on Sunday morning. I went to the market and I bought those muffins because I knew that in the week, I needed to feed the whole family with those muffins on the Wednesday morning, which is now a Friday. Which is now a Friday. I think this might be the first muffin we've had for breakfast on this show. Okay. It's very, very exciting. So we're going to talk about one of your newer projects today. You're working with Harper's Bazaar Italia, which I think is really interesting and we can kind of get into that. But I'm very excited to chat with you both about your business and how it formed. And you've had such a big impact on sort of the aesthetics of culture, but also obviously working a lot with the fashion industry. And you really saw fashion transform from this sort of ancillary thing globally to now a major influence on pop culture. And you were a big part of that. So I'm excited to chat with you about what you have all observed working together for the past 30 years. But maybe we can start. Can you kind of explain what you do? And do you consider yourselves graphic designers, creative directors, art directors? Like what word would you use and how would you describe it? It's always a very complicated and very simple question at the same time. We describe ourselves as MM, which is why we created an entity that can encompass whatever things we want to do and whatever thing we want to try. And that can and where we can act as graphic designer, which is like the base and the platform from which we built like our toolbox, but also as art directors, or creative directors, or photographers, or typographers, or sign makers, or writers sometimes. So it's just like a box of possibility, I would say. I think the idea of building a platform that allows us to craft, think, or improvise many different projects was the aim of our partnership. I think we were trained as artists or people that were that could possibly do whatever they want and especially invent the formats of what you call some like a working like we were able to invent like our working ways. So the idea was to build this platform called MMParis and as Michael was saying, it's just to inside that box be able to tackle many things that were triggering us. But mainly the focus was like how do you shape culture and how do you create or put culture in motion so it goes through time and it's not destroyed by economy. So this was very important that culture can go beyond the idea of transaction and then can survive. So that's why we were, it's a company that we built so that we need to economically deal with the world so we can subsist and then we still be able to to carry on thinking and producing utopias. So that's very important. It reminds me, were you all, I know you worked with Loewe and Jonathan Anderson for a long time, were you all a part of the conceiving the show in the box? Yes, completely from scratch. That feels like a microcosm of what you all do because I was, we were just discussing Mateus and I were both in Tokyo the last couple of weeks and I went to the Loewe kind of, I don't know even what you would call it event that they're doing their exhibition and they had one of the show in the box from the menswear show. I think the first one he did or maybe the only one and essentially what it was, maybe you all can describe it but it feels like a very good example of how you are in the culture. The show in the box happened because we were all locked down as you know and we were having like Zoom conversation with Jonathan that was trying to find a way to to represent the collection without falling into the trap of going all digital and doing something like just like a film or a piece of content that would be like a capture of the collection and his intuition was to go analog and to go analog as much as possible. We had done a few months before a special box set for Bjork with who we've been working for like over 25 years and that special box set is like I can show it to you later. It's like a plexiglass case that has like birds with holes records leaflet poster records and it's a kind of like a container that condenses a lot of things from different origins just to speak about the album in a way that is not literal and Jonathan was really inspired by this and said could you imagine doing something alongside that idea also with as a reference with the that we shared which is the Marcel Duchamp Portable Museum and of course for us it was very natural and we immediately like started thinking about how to develop this idea and how to break down the collection into different items and different pieces of artifacts and objects that could portray the collection. So there was this idea of creating the set of the show that was like a pop-up made of paper there was this idea of the soundtrack where we created this this a paper turntable where there was a seven inch that you could play by hand without using electricity that's just amplified by a piece of cardboard and a needle. I think we added like a little silhouette that you could build in 3d there was also embossed paper to recreate the texture of the close sample of the texture of the sorry texture of the textiles samples of the textiles I don't know there was many many things in this there was like a pattern to be able to rebuild one of the pieces and all this was was condensed into this kind of archival box that placed it in time but also like in the future. I mean as you said Lauren I think that that's kind of a is a good image or metaphor for our work where we keep within the world building smaller world that are connected to the bigger world and and and this is for us it sounds like a crazy or very monomaniac things to do but this this we think is very efficient where instead of trying to change everything at once it's better to to kind of simplify rfi and then create little world that we can completely reorganize as example for others you know like uh people living in the same world than us they could look at it and maybe start to rethink the way they they see culture or they see the world itself so when we created that that that show in the box I mean it was a kind of a revolution because it never existed before of course there are artists that did about this kind of things well like the fluxus artist or as mech was saying Marcel Duchamp where he in order to make his work travel he puts everything shrink down everything and put it in a box so his work could travel the world it never happened before that uh fashion show was put in was put in was put in a in a box so he could travel the world but travel the world into space but also into time the idea that maybe in 50 years or 100 years time people could still look at it and then have a record of that show much in a much vivid way than a show that happened in real life why is that because uh it takes time it takes a long time for paper to be too to to rot or to disappear and and I think this idea of like longevity both into future and past is very important that's why in our work there is a kind of a classic approach what one of the project previous project that we did and was also instrumental in the thinking of this is that I can't remember when I think during the mid 2000 we were we have been commissioned to create a book or a volume about the archives of Stanley Kubrick about Napoleon which is the movie that he never finished and that was into production for over 25 years and and and and Kubrick being so obsessive he had assembled the most important database and private collection of artifacts facts news images iconography about the life of Napoleon I mean he was mind-blowing and and and we we approached this by doing a huge book that was carved out and inside which was where he done several volumes as a as a decomposition as a classification of all the elements that were that could be used to make the thing so there was of course the script the treatment but there was also like an image database that was accessible online with like over 40 000 pictures if I remember well there was like the costumes there was picture of the costume and test that he did with his daughter and his driver and his garden trying different lenses to see how what distance you needed to record paper costumes to cost less in production and this crazy amount of of of work and information was condensed into this very very big volume that was kind of a treasure box and and it's it's great because this was meant to be like of course an archive but also an active piece the book was called the greatest movie never made and of course what we said is that it would be fantastic if someone one day was able to tackle into this and create the movie and then what happened I think is last year is that Steven Spielberg eventually decided to adapt all the the Kubrick research based on the book into a tv series which is which must be in production now oh interesting so there was a there was a kind of advertising on social media I mean announcement and it was the portrait of Steven Spielberg next to the cover of that uh uh ingredient book you know how to make uh how to be uh Stanley Kubrick so that that I mean again this is very strong metaphor of the way we work where it's heavily crafted it's we put a lot of our hands and thinking in it but then eventually it's very open as it's a gift for the others to play back with these uh elements again there's there's a feeling that all of this work is bringing up in me that I got when I saw the show in the box in Tokyo that feels very similar it goes back to childhood and like a fancy dress box when you open it you don't know what's going to be in it and you're going through and playing dress up or whatever it's that same I don't know the word but it's something that is very hard to capture in this current world we live in because everything's so instantaneous and maybe it's like the sort of basic way to say it is surprise and delight but there is this like very internal thing that you all are able to get at that makes your workout feel like it has more depth and also like makes the brain work in a different way I would love to hear a little bit about how you all met and started collaborating and do you think that it has to do with the two of you working together for so long and being able to get to something deeper than a lot of people are able to do but but I think I mean there is a there is a the beginning of a solution in what you are saying in the sense yes the fact that we are two people together helps to already create something that's more polyphonic you know because instead of having one creator you have two like you have two brains so you have four eyes like four hands and it's already it brings the idea of the alterity where each time we do something it's like you already have someone that could look at it you know so it's not that you're creating only for yourself there is right away the the notion of dialogue so if you take the metaphor of jeepeto creating pinocchio it's like there are already two people creating this kind of almost human thing it's not a human but it's almost alive so this is what we are trying to do each time we work we try to create something that's almost alive it feels like a live entity and that could be self-sufficient so of course it's never completely alive we're not saying we create us in the sense where we create your alive things but we like the things that we create to have this kind of complexity that you are describing so that when you open in there is you open it or when you start to play with it there is this notion of enchantment where as you are enchanted as when you meet someone for the first time and then you strongly connect you know you say oh that's you know you and then dialogue is starting yeah yeah I think it's it's the idea of the object being autonomous and not just being like a surface yeah if because if you only start from graphic design and if you look at things like as a flap representation you miss the point of like the context and and this is where in whatever we produce this idea of the thing or the object as something that's self-standing and that contains its own intelligence and that can be decoded by by different people and in different time and different contexts is very important once we did like a long time ago one of the first book we did was a compilation of like prints and posters that we had designed as well as objects and stuff and as a promotional sticker on the cover there was like a catchphrase that was saying material for future archaeologists. I mean just to finish this like we have a recurrent figure in our work it's called the agent it's like a very simplified human shape that looks a bit like it's between a cross or a little person with open arms and he has no it doesn't seems that he is laughing or he's sad he's neither sad or happy but it's kind of a living figure that's being throughout of many of a piece and he even run the marathon as he was on the mail like the marathon medal of paris where it was like when we were asked to design the medal for the marathon paris he was one of the symbols that were that we engrave on the medal so again it's a sign it's an image but it has a longer lifespan and it's self-standing somehow.

studio where i see a lot of a lot of your work mateus you you seem to be in the room where all the paper is the paper room but do you work together every single day when you're in the in in paris yes in the big room where michael is right now yes this is like the the main room where we work like this kind of a more historical ale of our office or studio or i don't know how you call it and then now there is a new ale where there is like a or like the rest of the collaborators which is like all together five persons i mean it's not a big studio we produce a lot of things but we don't have a it's not like a elongated list of people like our collaborators it's a small team it's a bit like a basketball team instead of a rugby team or american football team five five who's who's the the center who's the power forward do you feel like one of the reasons you've been able to sustain is because you all are still really doing the the actual work and not just directing yeah i think this is one of the the reason why we still are exciting with our work is that uh i mean again like this metaphor of the basketball is like or the way we run that team is that the idea is that everyone should be able to be everywhere on on on the ground and there is not one specialist in just throwing the ball very far away one very specialist of the dribble i think the idea is that we should be able to replace everyone if if we feel having saying that we all have passion or things that we are extremely fascinated by so this is that kind of mix and the idea of being able to still be excited after like 35 or 33 years of work is because we still try to deal with very small scale things to very big ones and it's not just to say like okay we're not just like coordinators we still hands on basically Michael i think this is the first time anyone smoked on fashion people and i'm sorry i'm taking off my just being in the next room so i can smoke in the office sorry sorry to out you but it's too good of a detail um how did you all meet you met at school or how did you how did you realize you would be able to do to work together we met we met in the art school in the art decorative in paris i think he was like october 89 and we met on the first day of of school that year unlike the back to school day where there was this big reunion of all the students that were being asked to come to get some information about like the year and i had been in that school for like that was my third year in the school and matthias joined from a different art school where he had graduated already and and he was like a new character that was entering the the scene and and we hit off very very quickly on that first day because on that day i was really proud of my outfit i was dressed with like a pair of of worker pants blue and i had blue shoes blue moccasin and blue socks and a blue jacket from the post office that i had bought from the flea market and i was speaking to a friend and and telling her how happy i was to be feeling very monochrome and matthias overheard the conversation and then like a couple of minutes later he bumped into me and pushed me quite violently and said move over monochrome and that was the start of the conversation matthias is that how you remember it yeah of course and i had i uh i did a conference in Shanghai for tea china where we were supposed to talk about fashion and how it outraged cultures and like at the beginning of the converse like the the conference or the conversation i did tell this exact same story from my point of view i mean it doesn't really there was no big difference but it was the same thing i just heard that guy like they was saying like very loudly and proudly okay i'm all wearing blue and this is say okay this guy needs to some attention and we need to discuss because i like the the the fact that is very like has a strong minded way of being himself so i said that would be a good person to to discuss with because i think this is important that uh uh that we have a strong minded conversation it this is also part of the work where why did it work with uh for instance Jonathan Anderson it's like uh because he had he was a strong minded person so this is where it creates fire or when we work with uh uh Nicolage Esquire he's a strong minded person too so it creates it creates sparkles and then this is how when i saw Michael at school i say oh that guy must be worth discussing creating a dialogue and of course it was even more because we are still working together and and and and and even in the meantime you know like uh i finish my studies in uh in england in the royal college of art because i joined that school the the decorative art because i had a plan where i wanted at one point to leave paris for a while just to see paris from far away or at least uh over the channel because i had been living in paris for a bit too long and i needed to to see it from afar to see what could be done again with it it's interesting that's a really interesting thread we could pull about i think the the generation of french people who the e you being able to move and i i i assume this was be that happened what late 90s 2000 so this is before that so you were ahead of it but i think it's changed the culture of paris exactly i mean this idea of european culture is very very strongly anchored in at least in myself i mean i studied in england in 1999 till 1991 and it was truly like a the peak of like the construction of europe there was not yet the the train that goes on under the sea and when we were students we were and then when we started to have a kind of political conscience and this was like put in our head by the like the the president then that was françois mitterrand this kind of last time that there was a true i would say left-wing cultural political culture at the state of france and they what was interesting then that it it was the construction of europe enabling all this kind of all the people or all the inhabitant from europe from italy to spain to germany to poland england or just to at one point is to be conscious that they were living on the same continent and they could really build like a they could really produce a cultural exchange before like going to england it was a truly a drag you need to take the plane and it fell very far away and that's why that was the strength of like this european construction is that it helped at least me or even michael or the young people just just to be able to meet people outside their country and go away from this kind of a nationalistic approach where you're just proud of being french because you think france is at the center of the world and then each country for a long time were thinking like like this in europe and i think it really created a strength even for and that's why fashion for us was so important because before the art world being the art world of today the fashion world was was great with fashion world it was it was making people flying all over the world and then traveling and then sharing experiences and sharing culture and that's why i think this is i mean we keep forgetting this i think it's like fashion weeks in paris were enabling people like us to see people coming from japan for instance which is seems now okay what's so exciting about this yes it was a kind of exciting like to meet people from japan or england or america in a in a city of paris that was at the time extremely french and very close in itself as we become more global in the past few years though especially there's also this sort of isolationist bent especially in america i mean i live in california and it feels like not connected to the rest of the world if you go to dinner no one talks about what's happening in the rest of the world do you feel that in europe at all that it's peope i know brexit is one thing but just generally that people are turning inward again or do you think that the connectivity and and globalization is making sure that that doesn't happen i mean this is this is the tricky part right now i think it's globalization i mean i don't want to to go too far but like i think also it's now important to readdress the idea of globalization i mean when we first travel all around the world like going to to to japan or to america it was a true like a magic because it not everyone was doing this so you'd still had the conscious that you were doing something extraordinary and it was not yet linked just to the idea of like making a global market we knew this could happen but it was still just a kind of a we could still ourselves like travelers that were discovering the world like travelers that were trying to understand how all the other people live or how do they deal with culture so it's true that in the contemporary world today in 2025 there is this idea of like a lot of people are going back into the what they will call their roots which is a bit strange because i mean this is true that there is a it because it's becoming or like a complicated again where there is this kind of a nationalistic idea that's coming back again but doesn't really it's a bit doesn't really it doesn't mean it means a lot i mean it it doesn't mean anything anymore because we went global so it's just like retracting back and without thinking of what does it mean of retrashing back so it's kind of complicated i think it's it's it's it's yeah it's very complicated because there is this idea of like closing yourself into your local environment but at the same time everything is so marginalized and everything is so flattened that now wherever you travel you consume mostly the same things or or or what is the postcard or the the the the shareable part of like authenticity or the or or or so-called authenticity but now nothing feels authentic anymore it's true but but but but though the thing is though there is some kind of authenticity this is where it's complex it's just like that's why i think it's we still have you know things to discover because yes there is a i would say there is a skin of where of homogenized skin but still there is a lot of complexity to be to to be solved or re-articulated even the way you live it doesn't even if we are very close i'm sure we have a lot of different way of approaching life when you all started working together were you doing more projects and music and film and lesson fashion and did that develop or or how did your sort of of entry ways into culture change over the decades you've been working together it went quite fast and and originally like when we when we started the company in 92 i had done like a stint at a music magazine for two years before between or overlapping with my years in college and and while i was meeting for matthews to complete his his studies in london so we had the chance to have like a small client base in the music industry in paris at that time and and and because of our interesting music and because of like the importance of what culturally he was representing for us record sleeves and and and music as a kind of definition of communities he was for us very very exciting and natural to start in music he was this coincides also in time with like the the the fact that the computer and the setup of the mac allowed us to work domestically and not without having to build like a proper agency or like a proper structure and that idea of the small unit that was very mobile was made possible because the technology happened at that time and we were lucky to be able to cross over between analog and digital and to learn the two at the same time so so and then from them from the music experiments and projects we did we were introduced by a friend to to uh iran silvanni there was a creative director at at yosie mamoto i think it was 94 she was a former editor and chief of french fog she saw lots of random projects we had done for like very very tiny things for french singers or brochures or posters that we had done in in many different kind of small contexts and she took the leap and commissioned us to do originally what was a very tiny commission that was an invitation for the opening of a of yosie star in paris honneau de bronel and and and once we had created like a proposal and delivered her with our ideas she was so excited that she decided to turn that into a full on campaign so all in our the graphics for our invitation became a campaign that was in the magazine that all of a sudden it was crazy how quickly like the scale had changed and he was one of the most important designer of of those times and still now and and i think that was like the first key that unlocked for us the the doors of the fashion world very quickly after we started working with with marques collie on jill sander and worked with her directly for a long time with him and without him after and through that we were able to really understand fashion from working with designers before working with brands i think what's different i one of your all your question was like what did you observe in terms of the definition of the fashion and scape over the course of your work is that we started working with designers because designers were at the helm of their own brands jill yogi martin cibbon everyone was carrying his own house and it's and it's only much later that around the turn of the of the 2000 when collie was hired at balenciaga that this idea of the creative director or the designer for a house changed the whole model for us the fashion was a cultural territory where where like in france where when we were in art school that wasn't really taken taken for granted it was a kind of a it was not very well considered though they were extremely enormous designer and still alive like if salo ron was still alive when we were students but somehow it was less kind of people had more respect for eric romer or jen luc godard than issa loran you know like a it was distorted there was this kind of distortion where they it was there but they were they were taking it for granted that it was there but they were not yet considering that it was truly an important art act of a creative act this is later that happened like there when there was the big show retrospective at the centre george pompidou of saint loran that that suddenly but gradually that fashion and culture and art were starting to be woven all together we kind of had that intuition before and then first people saw in fashion just like a way an economical resource took them longer also to to understand that some fashion designer were true artists like comparable to any kind of artist from like painting sculpture or performance or or even filmmaker you know that's that's but that for us everything was kind of leveled in the set that not everything is everything but like we could say we could start to put in dialogue things that were not authentified from the same field this is what was important and this is where we come back on the building of m m paris was to put in dialogue things that had nothing to do together at first and this is what made us kind of special because at the beginning we were the only one to to to say okay let's promote arts from our generation like artists such as philippe parrainau or pierre huig that are no that are no extremely well known and well wide well known but like how do you put them in dialogue with the nicolages care at the beginning this was not possible now philippe parrainau and and nicolages care work together because we created the connection like 25 years ago or not 25 but 20 years ago or and this is something that's now again taken from granted but this is where we operated also as a product producer of realities it was not only by making or producing images or creating space or creating objects but it was also by connecting people you know like connected creating new networks of uh uh creative production i would say same same thing with bjork you know the way we met bjork it's because she saw a piece of uh of a catalog that we did with jama auto with in s and v nude and she she stumbled on to this and say who are those guys that these those fake those images i would love to be in that world and she kind of contacted in s and v nude and then they contacted us because they say to bjork you know if you want that kind of world we should all be that world together and this is what happened and this is where this is the reason why since like the year 2001 like from the from the album 98

amazon.com slash prime how do you think magazines fit into all of this because you've kind of gone in and out a lot of people who have i don't want to say similar practices to yours but have our you know creative directors who have their independent studios will often consult on a magazine and but have this other practice where they do commercial work and and other special work and it feels like to me magazines tend to be most successful when they're set up that way where there's someone from the outside who can sort of see a bigger picture and and work with the editor-in-chief but michael you mentioned you worked at a music magazine in a university or right after university but you've kind of dipped in and out of magazines throughout your your time together what do you what role do you think the magazine played in this sort of delivery of culture and what what does it do now that you know we are so connected and it doesn't have the same purpose that it had 20 years ago even or even 10 i think i still think it the thing it's it's it's uh first of all i think i see a magazine it's a platform of a hub you know like it's it's a place where you can you are able to connect people just put people in dialogue and then they deliver the vision of the world to a larger audience and and i think what's kind of nice with magazine that it stopped in time because it's printed on paper so instead of being a perpetual flow of images or that are not very well edited it's or digitally edited or artificially edited here it's edited by a bunch of people of person that suddenly say okay we choose for you this all this series of mem formation and it could be good that we take the time to think about it together and i think this is what makes a magazine exciting and the thing is this was very daring in the 90s or even before because it was really efficient because there was nothing in competition with the with the magazine not even television and then and then magazine went through a rough rides where people said oh it's not important anymore so they just completely forget that they were supposed to to trigger culture or try to make people think about the world so they just became just like a platform to sell things so they were not even uh celebrating culture they were just selling objects but like poorly selling it so i think it could be nice today because we can control there are other ways to sell things that were sold in the magazine so you could go back to today and say okay maybe it could be good to find a way to deliver information or to deliver thoughts on another pace than the one of that you can find on film television radio or even social media there is still the pace of the magazine that could be a good one to have because it's kind of nice to say okay i can touch and read the magazine in a place where i don't have a relationship to electricity or i can read the magazine uh right in the middle of a swimming pool yes you could do this with an iPad but it's less exciting i would say so i think there is still this kind of uh i don't know it's almost like a way to consume information or to consume culture at a very special in a very special way so that's why i think it's good to reconsider that format today without being nostalgic and saying oh there was the heydays of like the face or idea or the magazine avant garde you know like we say okay how do we create that moment again where we create the new fetish for people to look at in the fifth like in 50 years or 30 years time and say oh the life of those people was was so good because i'm looking back in this paper magazine because again it's quite easy to look at paper archive rather than digital archive that's quite difficult to look in digital archive even if you can google or youtube things very difficult to find like a precise the precise feeling of of an era by doing so i mean it's the idea of the real time time capsule and i think this is why it's exciting even in the age of of of the digital and in the age of social media magazine had a different function before of course obviously they were like important into defining the community and to which community you identify or you belong and to which part of culture you could have access and of course now everything is distributed very differently but what's missing in the in the digital aspect of of today is this idea of permanence and this idea of like stopping things in time and this is where the the magazine as a time capsule as an ongoing current time capsule is very interesting and is very important what made you say yes to the project with harbors bizarre italia did stephano talk he was very adamant yes stephanie was very persuasive and and but he was also very clear into like the ambition of of what could be achieved and also because the magazine is acting from a position of success it's not as if we have to to solve a problem or save a situation or try to redefine how it can operate it operates very well and it's about bringing it to the next level and bringing it into something that's even more relevant i think it's it's a good place to perform you know because often we are called when there is a problem which is a bit tiring so it's kind of it could be nice to say oh i mean i actually no problem here it's just like let's make it a pleasurable journey how important is it that the person in stephano's position be someone that you feel like can be a sparring partner like you were saying with jonathan or nicola how when it's the editor do you want them to push back a lot or do you want them to only push back a little i think it's pull and push it goes both ways i think it's about finding a way that makes it exciting that makes it exciting for everyone to take part in and to find a way to maybe witness and and and give back things that otherwise can be overlooked i think i mean this was the same thing when we were for french drug it did work because we were of working with very strong woman that has a very strong point of view and they were when i was when i say woman it's just like there was carine emmanuel anastasia and then maria melisauvet i mean he was very strong characters that we it was almost impossible to talk quietly but that was that that that was making the beauty of it because we did it it was not about like say okay who is running who is not running who is taking decision and who is following the others he was more to how do you create a strong voice being heard where you had already six people saying very loud things how do you channel that energy in one you know in one channel and then suddenly this kind of vibrant collaborative or discussion or dialogues make it interesting for for the audience i think this is quite this is the important part and then it i think like the idea of the editor-in-chief or at least someone that has like when i'm the notion of editor or like someone that choose that has the position of being to say okay i'm channeling the information it's important that it has a a strong point of view or strong character otherwise it's not very interesting because this is also where we never wanted to do our own magazine to talk about our own self because this is a bit a bit sad you know like looking at yourself it's good maybe in the mirror but like throughout the magazine it becomes a bit of a very heavy experience and i think here there is an editorial team and even like a massimo that's in charge of the the magazine itself and then we met the the editorial team and people working in Milan when we spent two days discussing with everyone that was exciting too because it feels that it's not about ourselves it's about like how do we create this kind of programmatic platform i think i think what was there important in your conversation we had with Stefano originally and with the team at large is that rather than just providing a service as a magazine it's important in this case to reconsider fashion as a cultural commentary and this idea of the cultural commentary through fashion that can be decoded and that can be retranscribed in the magazine is key to to to the project one sort of i guess like bigger question for you you met michael you mentioned earlier the flattening of culture which i think about all the time and especially through the lens of a magazine which was so much of the references people use today are magazine images that or advertising images that were created 10 20 30 40 50 years ago because they're so accessible to people how do creative people avoid that flattening or break through that flattening today when you are inundated with imagery like the the idea of not being on instagram or not being on the internet it's just not feasible for most people how do you for people who are building careers like yours or trying to build careers like yours how do you or any sort of image maker or creative person how do you get past that flattening to something deeper because it it seems really hard it's i mean it's it's a it's a question it's a question of methodology and i think this is where our methodology is probably different than most of the others is that we resist and we try to stay away from the idea of the mood board it's not about putting images from the past and trying to recreate them it's about understanding where you are and defining some rules and within this set of rules playing a game that can create something new it's very funny like yesterday there was a this post on boring.com referencing the the cover of Carci magazine which is a ripoff of an image we did for Yosie Mamoto with Craig McDean i think in 2001 and of course it's tiring for us to see like how these images have are being exhausting and reused and reused and no one trying nothing new and when we did those images i'm talking about the images of Amber Valeta with the paper mask there was a cut out it was something that was very instinctive and that could only happen because the set of rules that we had defined for that character for Yosie Mamoto at that time allowed these circumstances to happen yeah it's um it's a real it's i don't think it's that people are lazy but it's a real lazy it's creating laziness i think i i think it's it's not about lazy not lazy or the flattening it's just like uh i think an antidote to the flattening is just also to to there is this belief in you in yourself in the self where it's still it's still important to to to realize that creating it's it's a very complex and complicated journey and it's not like uh you can't have a success every time or you can't the notion of doubt is very important the notion of intuition is very important and this is where i think it's this is where to resist to to to flattening things is also to understand that the complexity that you have to deal with can't be solved by just using machine that helps you to to kind of uh makes everything feel easy even in the consumer the consumerizing like even in consuming images it's so easy to consume image on social network that it's good to say okay it's easy but i can do it a bit but then maybe i can stop and then start to challenge myself and then how do i look at an image or how do i read the text or access to an information and it's gonna actually be complex to enter what i'm going through and that's this is where i think it's this is to kind of fight against that kind of flatten flatten of things it's important to to to to understand that things are taking time and this is like giving time to things is it's very important in our days like even like uh you know like yes i can travel the world very fast or go to japan but like even if i don't go there for a certain amount of time it's good to understand to start to think okay it's taking time to do this it's not a given and this is important for myself to allow and to be generous with myself to to to understand that the complexity of what's happening is the beauty of this and i think this is this is the important part yeah i think the way we are consuming images today with like the endless solicitation of of the screen and the social media is numbing the idea of curiosity and is and because you think you see everything but you only see what has been failed to you and what has already been predetermined by your own behavior and your own taste and i think this is why it's very important to to be aware of that and to be open to things that are not part of your filter bubble one more question and then i'll let you all go because we've gone for for an hour now which is which is longer 20 minutes longer than my editor would like um how do you keep working together is it is it's like a marriage where the key to a marriage is not getting divorced how have you done it for so long it's it's a question and answer itself your editor would like the interview to end you made it it's great thank you very much lauren and for to the next question no i mean exactly it's it's just like uh it it it it kind of linked to what i was describing things are not easy it's not like we all know this uh to be alive is a complex situation to be in love is a complex situation to actually articulate a piece uh to work with someone is a complex situation so is how do you make things go past the complexity to enjoy that suddenly it becomes like a a pleasure and and then suddenly you're realizing that uh oh actually when you are too to to produce something it's actually much uh bigger and it has more impact and it's because it's not just one person thinking behind but it's already two and uh even if there are contradictory parts at the end it creates something that's maybe less obvious and more complex and has more chance to excite a third person that could say oh what the two of you are doing is quite interesting well let's make something let's be free to do something and and so on i think that's the i don't know this is how i see it does it answer your question uh yes or no yeah it too is always better than one right yeah the idea of working of working not on your own makes your your work less self-centered and less precious and so there is already a distance to what you're doing because you know that you have like the first you are next to you that's gonna perceive you differently so there is um there is some likeness to it thank you both so much this was such a pleasure same here thank you it's super fun fashion people is a presentation of odyssey in partnership with puck this show was
